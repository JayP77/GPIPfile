            "Text": "As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the United States Government (USG) is innovating and taking a new approach to help keep international air passengers healthy. The new, more effective strategy focuses on the continuum of travel and the individual passenger, including pre-departure and post-arrival education, efforts to develop a potential testing framework with international partners, and illness response. This strategy is consistent with the current phase of the pandemic and more effectively protects the health of the American public.\n\nBeginning September 14, 2020, the USG will remove requirements for directing all flights carrying airline passengers arriving from, or recently had a presence in, certain countries to land at one of 15 designated airports and halt enhanced entry health screening for these passengers. Currently, enhanced entry health screening is conducted for those arriving from, or with recent presence in, China (excluding the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau), Iran, the Schengen region of Europe, the United Kingdom (excluding overseas territories outside of Europe), Ireland, and Brazil.\n\nWe now have a better understanding of COVID-19 transmission that indicates symptom-based screening has limited effectiveness because people with COVID-19 may have no symptoms or fever at the time of screening, or only mild symptoms. Transmission of the virus may occur from passengers who have no symptoms or who have not yet developed symptoms of infection. Therefore, CDC is shifting its strategy and prioritizing other public health measures to reduce the risk of travel-related disease transmission.\n\nUSG resources will instead be dedicated to more effective mitigation efforts that focus on the individual passenger, including: pre-departure, in-flight, and post-arrival health education for passengers; robust illness response at airports; voluntary collection of contact information from passengers using electronic means as proposed by some airlines to avoid long lines, crowding and delays associated with manual data collection; potential testing to reduce the risk of travel-related transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 and movement of the virus from one location to another; country-specific risk assessments to assist passengers in making informed decisions about travel-related risk; enhancing training and education of partners in the transportation sector and at United States ports of entry to ensure recognition of illness and immediate notification to CDC; and post-arrival passenger recommendations for self-monitoring and precautions to protect others, with enhanced precautions, including staying home to the extent possible for 14 days for people arriving from high-risk destinations.\n\nBy refocusing our mitigation efforts on individual passenger risk throughout the air travel journey, the USG can most effectively protect the health of the American public.",

            "HeadLine": "Timing of State and Territorial COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Orders and Changes in Population Movement \u2014 United States, March 1\u2013May 31, 2020",
            "Text": "SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is thought to spread from person to person primarily by the respiratory route and mainly through close contact (1). Community mitigation strategies can lower the risk for disease transmission by limiting or preventing person-to-person interactions (2). U.S. states and territories began implementing various community mitigation policies in March 2020. One widely implemented strategy was the issuance of orders requiring persons to stay home, resulting in decreased population movement in some jurisdictions (3). Each state or territory has authority to enact its own laws and policies to protect the public\u2019s health, and jurisdictions varied widely in the type and timing of orders issued related to stay-at-home requirements. To identify the broader impact of these stay-at-home orders, using publicly accessible, anonymized location data from mobile devices, CDC and the Georgia Tech Research Institute analyzed changes in population movement relative to stay-at-home orders issued during March 1\u2013May 31, 2020, by all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories.* During this period, 42 states and territories issued mandatory stay-at-home orders. When counties subject to mandatory state- and territory-issued stay-at-home orders were stratified along rural-urban categories, movement decreased significantly relative to the preorder baseline in all strata. Mandatory stay-at-home orders can help reduce activities associated with the spread of COVID-19, including population movement and close person-to-person contact outside the household.\n\nData on state and territorial stay-at-home orders were obtained from government websites containing executive or administrative orders or press releases for each jurisdiction. Each order was analyzed and coded into one of five mutually exclusive categories: 1) mandatory for all persons; 2) mandatory only for persons in certain areas of the jurisdiction; 3) mandatory only for persons at increased risk in the jurisdiction; 4) mandatory only for persons at increased risk in certain areas of the jurisdiction; or 5) advisory or recommendation (i.e., nonmandatory). Jurisdictions that did not issue an order were coded as having no state- or territory-issued order.\u2020 These data underwent secondary review and quality assurance checks and were published in a freely available data set (4).\n\nPublicly accessible, anonymized location data from mobile devices were obtained to estimate county-level raw data regarding movement (5). Population movement was estimated by computing the percentage of individual mobile devices (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, or watches) reporting each day that were completely at home (i.e., had not moved beyond a 150-meter radius of its common nighttime location) within a given county, using a 7-day rolling average to smooth each county\u2019s pre- and postorder time series values. This analysis used four types of order index dates, based only on mandatory orders: 1) the start date of each state or territorial stay-at-home order for each county in that jurisdiction; 2) the relaxation or expiration date of each state or territorial stay-at-home order for each county in that jurisdiction; 3) the effective date of the first state-issued stay-at-home order (i.e., California); and 4) the first date a state-issued stay-at-home order ended (i.e., Alaska).\u00a7\n\nTo assess changes in movement when mandatory state or territorial stay-at-home orders went into effect and ended, counties were first stratified along rural-urban categories to ensure that counties with similar population sizes were grouped together.\u00b6 A box plot was constructed for each rural-urban category to examine the distribution of county mean percentages of devices at home during the pre- and postorder periods associated with each index date. Because it was not assumed that movement values follow a normal distribution for all counties and periods, a clustered Wilcoxon signed rank test was then performed for each stratum, with counties as clusters, on the constituent counties\u2019 median pre- and postorder values associated with each index date. A lower-tailed test was used for index dates related to the start of state and territorial orders, and an upper-tailed test was used for index dates related to the end of state and territorial orders** (6). Strata-level statistical significance was assessed at the 99% confidence level (\u03b1 = 0.01). Analyses were performed using Python (version 3.6; Python Software Foundation) and R (version 3.5; The R Foundation). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.\u2020\u2020\n\nDuring March 1\u2013May 31, 42 states and territories issued mandatory stay-at-home orders, affecting 2,355 (73%) of 3,233 U.S. counties (Figure 1). The first territorial order was issued by Puerto Rico (March 15), and the first state order by California (March 19). Eight jurisdictions issued only an advisory order or recommendation to stay home, and six did not issue any stay-at-home orders. Most jurisdictions issued multiple orders during the observation period, and coding varied among individual orders. The duration and termination of each order varied by jurisdiction. During the observation period, 22 jurisdictions transitioned from a mandatory order to an advisory order, 11 rescinded or allowed orders to expire without extending, and the order in one jurisdiction was ruled invalid by the state\u2019s supreme court.\u00a7\u00a7 The first state to rescind or allow a stay-at-home order to expire was Alaska (April 24). Eight jurisdictions had mandatory orders applicable to at least some part of the population that extended beyond May 31.\n\nDifferences in county-level mean population movement during the pre- and postorder periods varied by index date and rural-urban strata (Figure 2). Decreased median population movement was observed in 2,295 (97.6%) of the 2,351 counties for which population movement data were available. Mandatory stay-at-home orders were associated with decreased population movement (i.e., higher median percentage of devices at home) during the 28-day period after the order start date, relative to the baseline 28-day period before the order start date. This relationship was significant in all rural-urban strata (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/92406). Among the 2,355 counties subject to mandatory stay-at-home orders, 436 (19%) had an order that expired on or before May 3, which is the latest possible expiration date that allows for a 28-day postorder observation period.\u00b6\u00b6 Movement significantly increased (i.e., lower median percentage of devices at home) in the period immediately after the expiration or lifting of orders in all rural-urban strata.\n\nThe 14-day period immediately after the first state stay-at-home order was issued in the United States was associated with a significant decrease in movement in all rural-urban strata relative to the 14-day period immediately preceding its implementation.*** The period after the first state relaxed a stay-at-home order was associated with increased population movement at the strata level among states or territories that had not relaxed a stay-at-home order in the same period.\u2020\u2020\u2020\n\nTop\n\nDiscussion\nBased on location data from mobile devices, in 97.6% of counties with mandatory stay-at-home orders issued by states or territories, these orders were associated with decreased median population movement after the order start date, relative to the period before the order was implemented. Reduced population movement helps prevent close contact among persons outside the household, potentially limiting exposure to persons infected with SARS-CoV-2. This suggests that stay-at-home orders can help protect the public\u2019s health by limiting potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and reducing community transmission of COVID-19.\n\nThe implementation of stay-at-home orders might affect population movement differently depending on when and where orders are issued and to whom they apply. The observed decrease in population movement after the implementation of the first state-issued mandatory stay-at-home order in California suggests that the implementation of certain public health policies might influence behaviors in other areas, in addition to persons directly subject to the action. However, this observation occurred in the context of other variables, which might have influenced behaviors, including the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic, declaration of national or state emergencies, media attention to fatalities and increased demands on hospitals, gathering bans, closures of schools and businesses, and cancellation of sporting events.\n\nIncreases in population movement were evident among counties in jurisdictions where stay-at-home orders were lifted, as well as in other communities as orders began to lift nationwide. Such increases might be driven in part by persons resuming preorder movement behaviors in response to the lifting of orders where they lived, or in response to perceived reduced risk associated with the lifting of orders elsewhere. Many other factors might have also played a role, and additional studies are needed to determine which factors caused population movement to increase across jurisdictions after the first state stay-at-home order ended.\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\n\nFurther research is needed to assess the impact of reduced population movement and other community mitigation strategies on the spread of COVID-19. For example, understanding the relationship between stay-at-home orders in contiguous counties and movement might explain how same-state and neighboring-state policy changes can affect public health by mitigating or exacerbating external environmental and social factors affecting population movement.\u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 As the pandemic continues and jurisdictions consider reimplementing mitigation policies, additional studies are needed to assess the impact of reissuing stay-at-home orders.\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, although relative device coverage largely correlates with U.S. population density, some regions or demographic groups might be over- or underrepresented.**** Second, persons might have multiple mobile devices and might not take certain devices with them when they leave the home (e.g., tablets) or might take multiple devices with them simultaneously (e.g., phones and smart watches). Third, although the clustered Wilcoxon signed rank test is used with counties as clusters because each county\u2019s median pre- and postorder values are paired comparisons rather than independent observations, potential spatial dependence among counties is not addressed. Fourth, this report does not assess whether population movement was affected by nationwide protests during the observation period.\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 Finally, this report analyzes the relationship between stay-at-home orders and population movement and does not assess the complex relationship between stay-at-home orders and illness incidence rates or deaths.\n\nMandatory stay-at-home orders can help reduce activities associated with community spread of COVID-19, including population movement and close person-to-person contact outside the household. Mandatory stay-at-home orders were associated with reduced population movement in most counties during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the relaxation of those orders was associated with increased movement. Although stay-at-home orders might assist in limiting potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and have had public support (7), such orders substantially disrupt daily life and have resulted in adverse economic impact (8). Further studies are needed to assess the timing and conditions under which stay-at-home orders might be best used to protect health, minimize negative impacts, and ensure equitable enforcement of community mitigation policies. These findings can inform public policies to potentially slow the spread of COVID-19 and control other communicable diseases in the future.",

            "Text": "Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 is intended to identify current infection in individuals and is performed when a person has signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19, or when a person is asymptomaticexternal icon but has recent known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Examples of diagnostic testing include testing symptomatic persons, testing persons identified through contact tracing efforts, and testing those who indicate that they were exposed to someone with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19. See CDC\u2019s Overview of Testing for SARS-CoV-2. The US. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) FAQs on Testing for SARS-CoV-2external icon also address diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nDefinition of Screening Testing\n\nScreening testing for SARS-CoV-2 is intended to identify infected persons who are asymptomatic and without known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Screening testing is performed to identify persons who may be contagious so that measures can be taken to prevent further transmission. Examples of screening include testing in congregate settings, such as a long-term care facility or a correctional facility, a workplace testing its employees, or a school testing its students, faculty, and staff. See CDC\u2019s Overview of Testing for SARS-CoV-2, Testing Guidelines for Nursing Homes, Interim Considerations for K-12 School Administrators for SARS-CoV-2 Testing, Considerations for Non-Healthcare Workplaces, and Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities. FDA\u2019s FAQs on Testing for SARS-CoV-2external icon also address screening testing for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nDefinition of Surveillance Testing\n\nPublic health surveillance is the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data essential to planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice. See CDC\u2019s Introduction to Public Health Surveillance. Surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 is intended to monitor for a community- or population-level infection and disease, or to characterize the incidence and prevalence of disease. Surveillance testing is used to gain information at a population level, rather than an individual level, and results of surveillance testing are only returned in aggregate to the requesting institution. Surveillance testing is performed on de-identified specimens, and thus results are not linked to individuals. Surveillance testing does not involve returning a diagnostic test result to an individual, or for individual decision-making. An example of surveillance testing is a plan developed by a state public health department to randomly select and sample a percentage of all persons in a city on a rolling basis to assess local infection rates and trends. See CDC\u2019s Overview of Testing for SARS-CoV-2. FDA\u2019s FAQs on Testing for SARS-CoV-2external icon also addresses surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nRapid Antigen Testing for SARS-CoV-2\nGeneral Guidance\n\nRapid antigen tests are commonly used in the diagnosis of respiratory pathogens, including influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The FDA has granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for antigen tests that can identify SARS-CoV-2. See FDA\u2019s list of In Vitro Diagnostics EUAsexternal icon.\n\nAntigen tests are immunoassays that detect the presence of a specific viral antigen, which implies current viral infection. Antigen tests are currently authorized to be performed on nasopharyngeal or nasal swab specimens placed directly into the assay\u2019s extraction buffer or reagent. The currently authorized antigen tests are not restricted to use on persons of a certain age. See Table 2 for additional information about antigen tests.\n\nAntigen tests are relatively inexpensive and can be used at the point-of-care. The currently authorized devices return results in approximately 15 minutes. Antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 are generally less sensitive than viral tests that detect nucleic acid using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). See FDA\u2019s list of In Vitro Diagnostics EUAsexternal icon for more information about the performance of specific authorized tests. Proper interpretation of antigen test results is important for accurate clinical management of patients with suspected COVID-19, or for identification of potentially infected persons when used for screening.\n\nThe clinical performance of rapid antigen diagnostic tests largely depends on the circumstances in which they are used. Rapid antigen tests perform best when the person is tested in the early stages of infection with SARS-CoV-2 when viral load is generally highest. They also may be informative in diagnostic testing situations in which the person has a known exposure to a confirmed case of COVID-19. Rapid antigen tests can be used for screening testing in high-risk congregate settings in which repeat testing could quickly identify persons with a SARS-CoV-2 infection to inform infection prevention and control measures, thus preventing transmission. In this case, there may be value in providing immediate results with antigen tests even though they may have lower sensitivity than RT-PCR tests, especially in settings where a rapid turnaround time is required. See FDA\u2019s FAQs on screening asymptomatic individuals and use of antigen tests in high risk congregate settingsexternal icon.\n\nThere are limited data to guide the use of rapid antigen tests as screening tests on asymptomatic persons to detect or exclude COVID-19, or to determine whether a previously confirmed case is still infectious.\n\nClinicians should understand antigen test performance characteristics in order to recognize potentially false negative or false positive results and to guide patient management. Laboratory and testing professionals who perform rapid antigen tests should also understand the factors that affect the accuracy of antigen testing, as described in this guidance.\n\nRegulatory Requirements for Using Rapid Antigen Tests for SARS-CoV-2\n\nFDA regulates in vitro diagnostic devices and has provided recommendations and information regarding EUA requests for COVID-19 diagnostic tests in the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests During the Public Health Emergency (Revised) (\u201cPolicy for COVID-19 Tests\u201d)external icon and the EUA templates referenced in that policy. COVID-19 assays and test systems used for diagnostic or screening testing, including those for antigen testing, must have received an EUA from FDA or be offered under the policies in FDA\u2019s Policy for COVID-19 Testsexternal icon. Any rapid antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 authorized for use by FDA will be included on FDA\u2019s list of In Vitro Diagnostics EUAsexternal icon.\n\nLaboratory and testing professionals who conduct diagnostic or screening testing for SARS-CoV-2 with rapid antigen tests must also comply with Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations. Any laboratory or testing site that intends to report patient-specific test results must first obtain a CLIA certificate and meet all requirements to perform that testing. For more information, see the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Service\u2019s (CMS) summary of the CLIA regulationspdf iconexternal icon. CMS has provided additional information on enforcement discretion for the use of SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care antigen tests on asymptomatic individuals on its websitepdf iconexternal icon.\n\nLaboratory and testing professionals who conduct surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 with rapid antigen tests are not obligated to comply with these FDA and CLIA requirements. However, CDC recommends that facilities that conduct surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 with antigen tests should use an antigen test that has been authorized for use, which are listed on FDA\u2019s In Vitro Diagnostics EUAsexternal icon. Information on surveillance testing performed by Universitiespdf iconexternal icon may be found on the CMS website.\n\nCollection and Handling of Clinical Specimens\n\nAll testing for SARS-CoV-2, including rapid antigen testing, is directly impacted by the integrity of the specimen, which depends on specimen collection and handling. Improper specimen collection may cause some swabs to have limited amounts of viral genetic or antigenic material for detection. Inadequate quality assurance procedures could result in cross contamination of the specimen, which could cause inaccurate test results. Delays from sample collection to testing should be minimized. Biosafety measures and instructions for use should be followed precisely to ensure accurate testing and safety of those who perform the testing. See CDC\u2019s guidance on Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens for COVID-19.\n\nSome antigen assays have explored the use of viral transport media, but the introduction of this dilution may decrease the sensitivity of the assay and carries the risk of cross contamination that can cause false-positive results. Laboratories and testing sites should follow the instructions for use and the package insert that are specific for the test system that they are using.\n\nPerformance of Rapid Antigen Tests for SARS-CoV-2\n\nIt is important for clinicians and testing personnel to understand the performance characteristics, including analytic sensitivity and specificity, of the particular rapid antigen test being used, and to follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and package insert.\n\nThe \u201cgold standard\u201d for clinical diagnostic detection of SARS-CoV-2 remains RT-PCR. Thus, it may be necessary to confirm a rapid antigen test result with a nucleic acid test, especially if the result of the antigen test is inconsistent with the clinical context. When confirming an antigen test result with a RT-PCR test, it is important that the time interval between collection of samples for the two tests is less than two days, and there have not been any opportunities for new exposures between them. If more than two days separate the two collections, or if there have been opportunities for new exposures, the nucleic acid test should be considered a separate test \u2013 not a confirmatory test. Table 2 summarizes the differences between RT-PCR tests and antigen tests.\n\nThe sensitivity of rapid antigen tests is generally lower than RT-PCR. The first antigen tests to have received FDA EUAs demonstrate sensitivity ranging from 84.0%-97.6% compared to RT-PCR. Antigen levels in specimens collected beyond 5-7 days of the onset of symptoms may drop below the limit of detection of the test. This may result in a negative test result, while a more sensitive test, such as RT-PCR, may return a positive result.\n\nThe specificity of rapid antigen tests is generally as high as RT-PCR \u2013 the first antigen tests that have received FDA EUAs have reported specificity of 100% \u2013 which means that false positive results are unlikely. Positive and negative predictive values of all in vitro diagnostic tests vary depending upon the pretest probability of the patient being tested. Pretest probability is impacted by the prevalence of the target infection in the community as well as the clinical context of the recipient of the test. Table 3 provides additional information on the relationship between pretest probability and the likelihood of positive and negative predictive values.\n\nCDC recommends that laboratory and testing professionals who perform rapid antigen testing should determine infection prevalence based on a rolling average of the positivity rate of their own SARS-CoV-2 testing over the previous 7\u201310 days. Infection prevalence at the time of testing, as well as the clinical context of the recipient of the test, impacts pretest probability. If a specific testing site, such as a nursing home, has a positivity rate near zero, the prevalence of disease in the community (e.g., cases per population) should instead be used to help determine pretest probability. Rapid antigen tests should be interpreted in the context of the prevalence of infection or disease, the device\u2019s performance characteristics and instructions for use, and the patient\u2019s clinical signs, symptoms, and history.\n\nEvaluating the Results of Rapid Antigen Testing for SARS-CoV-2\n\nEvaluating the results of a rapid antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 should take into account the performance characteristics (e.g. sensitivity, specificity), instructions for use of the FDA-authorized assay, the prevalence of COVID-19 in that particular community (positivity rate over the previous 7-10 days or cases per population), and the clinical and epidemiological context of the person who has been tested.\n\nThe evaluation of a diagnostic antigen test result should consider the length of time the patient has experienced symptoms. Generally, clinicians can rely upon a positive diagnostic antigen test result because the specificity of current FDA-authorized antigen tests is high in a person who has COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nThe sensitivity of current FDA-authorized antigen tests varies, and thus negative diagnostic testing results should be handled differently depending on the testing device and its stated performance characteristics. In most cases, negative antigen diagnostic test results are considered presumptive. CDC recommends confirming negative antigen test results with an RT-PCR test when the pretest probability is relatively high, especially if the patient is symptomatic or has a known exposure to a person confirmed to have COVID-19. Ideally, confirmatory RT-PCR testing should take place within two days of the initial antigen testing. If RT-PCR testing is not available, clinical discretion can be used in whether to recommend the patient isolate. See CDC\u2019s guidance on Quarantine and Isolation, Discontinuation of Isolation for Persons with COVID-19 Not in Healthcare Settings, Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions of Patients in Healthcare Settings, and Return to Work for Healthcare Personnel. CDC does not recommend using antigen tests to make decisions about discontinuing isolation.\n\nCurrently, the rapid antigen tests that have received EUAs from FDA are authorized for diagnostic testing on symptomatic persons within the first five to seven days of symptom onset. See FDA\u2019s In Vitro Diagnostics EUAsexternal icon in addition to information from CMS on enforcement discretion for the use of SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care antigen diagnostic testing on asymptomatic individualspdf iconexternal icon. Serial antigen testing within a closed congregate setting, such as a long-term care facility or a correctional facility, could quickly identify someone with a SARS-CoV-2 infection and prevent further transmission. Modeling evidenceexternal icon shows that outbreak control depends largely on the frequency of testing and the speed of reporting and is only marginally improved by high test sensitivity. For this reason, serial antigen testing may have benefits for early identification and controlling outbreaks in some situations, such as congregate living, compared to RT-PCR tests in settings with prolonged turnaround times. See FDA\u2019s FAQ on use of antigen tests in high risk congregate settingsexternal icon.\n\nWhen used for screening testing in congregate settings, test results for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered presumptive. Confirmatory nucleic acid testing following a positive antigen test may not be necessary when the pretest probability is high, especially if the person is symptomatic or has a known exposure. When the pretest probability is low, those persons who receive a positive antigen test should isolate until they can be confirmed by RT-PCR. See CDC\u2019s Discontinuation of Isolation for Persons with COVID-19 Not in Healthcare Settings, Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions of Patients in Healthcare Settings, and Return to Work for Healthcare Personnel.\n\nConfirmatory nucleic acid testing following a negative antigen test used for screening testing may not be necessary if the pretest probability is low, the person is asymptomatic, or has no known exposures, or is part of a cohort that will receive rapid antigen tests on a recurring basis. Nucleic acid testing is also considered presumptive when screening asymptomatic persons, the potential benefits of confirmatory testing should be carefully considered in the context of person\u2019s clinical presentation.\n\nCDC will update this guidance as more data become available.\n\nReporting Rapid Antigen Test Results for SARS-CoV-2 to Health Departments and Patients\n\nA CLIA-certified laboratory or testing site must report rapid antigen diagnostic test results to the local, state, tribal, or territory health department in accordance with Public Law 116-136, \u00a7 18115(a), the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which requires \u201cevery laboratory that performs or analyzes a test that is intended to detect SARS-CoV-2 or to diagnose a possible case of COVID-19\u201d to report the results of each such test. Antigen test results that are reported to public health departments must be clearly distinguished from other COVID-19 tests, such as RT-PCR tests and antibody tests.\n\nOn June 4, 2020, the US Department of Health and Human Services published guidance on COVID-19 Pandemic Response, Laboratory Data Reporting: CARES Act Section 18115pdf iconexternal icon that specifies what additional data should be collected and electronically reported to health departments along with COVID-19 diagnostic or screening test results. Laboratory and testing professionals should collect and report complete patient demographic information and ensure that they report antigen test results using the proper LOINC code for their particular FDA-authorized assay(s). Facilities should refer to CDC\u2019s LOINC In Vitro Diagnostic (LIVD) Test Code Mapping for SARS-CoV-2 Tests.\n\nA CLIA-certified laboratory or testing site must report antigen test results to the individual or the individual\u2019s healthcare provider according to the instructions for use of the FDA-authorized SARS-CoV-2 in vitro diagnostic device that was used. Depending on the stipulations of the FDA authorization, the laboratory or testing site may be required to report negative test results to patients as \u201cpresumptive negative.\u201d\n\nLaboratories that are either CLIA-certified or non CLIA-certified may conduct surveillance testing. Results of surveillance testing that uses rapid antigen tests can be returned in aggregate to the requesting institution, such as a university or public health agency. Negative antigen surveillance test results should be reported as \u201cpresumptive negative\u201d to the requesting institution. Laboratories, regardless of their CLIA status, should not officially report the results of surveillance testing to health departments. If a local, state, tribal, or territory health department requests access to the results of surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 that uses antigen testing, the laboratory should state in the report to the health department that the data are antigen surveillance testing results that do not represent COVID-19 diagnostic or screening test results.\n\nLaboratories that conduct surveillance testing, including surveillance testing that uses antigen tests, should not report test results to persons whose specimens have been tested, or to their health-care provider, employer, etc. Surveillance testing is performed on de-identified specimens, and thus results are not linked to an individual person. If at any time a laboratory intends to report a patient-specific test result, it must first obtain a CLIA certificate and meet all requirements to perform testing. For more information, see CMS\u2019s summary of the CLIA regulationspdf iconexternal icon. Table 1 also summarizes the reporting requirements depending on the type of testing that is performed.",

Now experts must assess whether the vaccine was responsible. Scientists on Wednesday praised the decision by AstraZeneca to suspend its late-stage coronavirus vaccine trials and begin a safety review after learning that a participant had developed a serious neurological condition. Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, testifying at a Senate hearing on Wednesday, said the step \u201cought to be reassuring.\u201d\n\nThe results of the safety review, to be conducted by an independent board of experts, will help determine if the participant\u2019s condition was a reaction to the vaccine candidate or merely coincidental, and are expected to heavily influence whether and when trials might resume.\n\nBut many details about the trial\u2019s suspension and the event that triggered it remain murky. Researchers do not yet know what caused the volunteer\u2019s symptoms, how long the evaluation process will take or what the consequences might be.\n\nPart of the review will include generating a timeline of the participant\u2019s symptoms to see if they match up roughly with when the vaccine was administered. The committee will also investigate other potential causes of the symptoms, in a process of elimination. After determining whether AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine is the probable cause, experts will advise the company on whether to resume its trials.\n\nRegulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration will also likely collect data and give additional input along the way, said Dr. Mark Goldberger, an infectious disease expert at the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership and a former F.D.A. official. No further doses of the vaccine will be administered in the interim.\n\nIn early-stage trials, AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine candidate, built from an innocuous virus, known to cause common colds in chimpanzees, that was engineered to carry coronavirus genes, yielded promising safety data in people, although several participants experienced mild or moderate side effects including fevers and aches. But the product was not necessarily responsible for the spate of symptoms experienced by the ailing late-stage trial participant, said Mark Slifka, a vaccine expert at Oregon Health and Sciences University.\n\nMore than 10,000 adult volunteers were dosed with AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine in the company\u2019s Phase 2/3 trial in the United Kingdom, where the participant fell ill. \u201cThe larger your study group, the more likely you\u2019ll find an adverse event,\u201d Dr. Slifka said. \u201cThis could occur spontaneously.\u201d A source familiar with the event, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said in an interview on Tuesday that the afflicted volunteer had experienced symptoms consistent with a condition called transverse myelitis, or inflammation of the spinal cord.\n\nIn a statement to reporters on Wednesday, an AstraZeneca spokesperson, Michele Meixell, said that the individual did not have a confirmed case of transverse myelitis. She said that the company\u2019s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, had stated in a phone call reported by STAT \u201cthat there is no final diagnosis and that there will not be one until more tests are carried out. Those tests will be delivered to an independent safety committee that will review the event and establish a final diagnosis.\u201d\n\nThe company did not respond to a request for clarification about whether transverse myelitis was suspected.\n\nTransverse myelitis is relatively rare, sparking symptoms in roughly 1,400 people each year in the United States, according to the National Institutes of Health. The condition can result in pain, muscle weakness, paralysis or bladder problems. Its root cause is often mysterious, although doctors believe the syndrome generally results when inflammatory responses in the body go awry, sometimes as a reaction to an ongoing or past infection, said Dr. Felicia Chow, a neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon that we never figure out the cause,\u201d she said.\n\nCORONAVIRUS SCHOOLS BRIEFING: It\u2019s back to school \u2014 or is it?\nSign Up\nThere has been some past speculation that vaccines might be able to trigger transverse myelitis, she added. A handful of vaccines have previously been tied to a smattering of other autoimmune disorders, including Guillain-Barre syndrome, wherein the immune system attacks the nerves. Such complications, however, are rare.\n\nBoth transverse myelitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome have been pinpointed as possible complications of Covid-19.\n\nAlthough vaccines are designed to be harmless to humans, they must still rouse the body\u2019s defenses to marshal a protective immune response. But if the wrong subsets of cells or molecules are spurred into action, or if the body cannot rein in its own responses, this could set off a cascade that starts to damage healthy tissues, said Dr. Serena Spudich, a neurologist at Yale University. The suspension appears to mark the second time that AstraZeneca has halted coronavirus vaccine trials because of severe neurological symptoms, according to information sheets uploaded to a clinical trial registry, as reported by Nature News. Another participant developed symptoms of transverse myelitis, researchers reported in July, and was later diagnosed with an \u201cunrelated neurological illness.\u201d After a safety review, trials resumed.\n\nMs. Meixell, the company spokesperson, confirmed the July pause, saying that the volunteer had \u201can undiagnosed case of multiple sclerosis, which the independent panel concluded was unrelated to the vaccine.\u201d\n\nAdverse events do occur during vaccine trials, which are explicitly designed to assess such situations to ensure that the products are both safe and effective in a wide range of people. Even if the newly reported symptoms were eventually tied to AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine, trials could still continue, especially if the case appears to be an outlier.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the vaccine is harmful,\u201d said Saad Omer, a vaccine expert at Yale University. As things stand, however, \u201cwe don\u2019t yet know the implications,\u201d he said.\n\nComplicating matters is the vaccine\u2019s dosing regimen, which involves two injections for each participant, four weeks apart. It is unclear whether the volunteer who experienced symptoms of transverse myelitis began to feel ill after receiving the first or second dose \u2014 a factor that could affect how other participants are treated, should the trial resume, Dr. Slifka said.\n\nAstraZeneca representatives did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the specifics of the pause or the measures they might take before attempting to resume trials.\n\nWhile the expert safety panel and the F.D.A. may independently weigh in as the situation develops, it is typically up to the trial\u2019s sponsor \u2014 in this case, AstraZeneca \u2014 to continue or end a trial, according to F.D.A. guidance. If the most recent adverse event is eventually confirmed as another neurological syndrome, \u201cabsolutely, they would want to go back and understand the first case better,\u201d Dr. Spudich said. Although the first participant\u2019s multiple sclerosis diagnosis was deemed unrelated to the vaccine, the data could be worth re-evaluating, she said.\n\nThere is a possibility, for instance, that a mild, undiagnosed case of multiple sclerosis may have been unmasked or exacerbated by the vaccine. However, it remains unclear whether that first volunteer received a vaccine or placebo, and how AstraZeneca would proceed with participants who have so far received the first dose but not the second.\n\nIn an online event on Thursday, Mr. Soriot, AstraZeneca\u2019s C.E.O., said that the company still expected to know by the end of the year whether its vaccine works in people, provided trials are able to resume soon. Such pauses are \u201cvery common, actually, and many experts will tell you this,\u201d Mr. Soriot added. \u201cThe difference with other vaccine trials is, the whole world is not watching them.\u201d\n\nAlthough the forecast for AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine candidate remains hazy, Dr. Goldberger emphasized that \u201cthis is a normal part of doing business in therapeutics and vaccines.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important to get safe and effective vaccines out there,\u201d he added. Should safety issues arise if a vaccine is prematurely rushed to approval, \u201cthat\u2019s going to affect general trust and willingness to be vaccinated,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got to sort through all of this to the end.\u201d",

            "HeadLine": "Considerations for Owners and Operators of Multifamily Housing Including Populations at Increased Risk for Complications from COVID-19",
            "Text": "Multifamily housing (e.g., apartments, condominiums, townhouses, duplexes, and quadruplexes) pose a challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic due to potential for increased risk of exposure for residents and staff. The following guidance is provided to help owners, administrators, and operators of multifamily housing work together with residents, staff, and public health officials to create a safe living environment and prevent the spread of COVID-19. Public health actions needed to reduce the spread of COVID-19, such as social distancing, can lead some people to feel isolated and lonely or can increase stress and anxiety. This page provides guidance in assessing and reducing exposure risks and resources for coping with stress in healthy ways.\n\nThese considerations are especially important for multifamily housing for older adults, residents living in settings that incorporate congregate or supportive services (e.g., multifamily housing that caters to older adults, low-income families, people with disabilities, etc.), and other populations who are at increased risk for acquiring COVID-19 and having complications. Other examples include individuals and families served through programs such as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Public Housing Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly, Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilitiesexternal icon, and Project-Based Rental Assistanceexternal icon, the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Multifamily Housing Rental Assistance Programexternal icon, or properties funded through the Low-Income Housing Tax Creditexternal icon program.\n\nGuiding principles\nOlder adults and groups experiencing disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19\nSevere illness means that the person with COVID-19 may require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe, or they may even die.\nOther factors may increase an individual\u2019s risk for severe illness, such as underlying medical conditions.\nAlthough older adults and people with underlying conditions face particular risks, everyone should take steps to protect themselves from exposure to the virus causing COVID-19.\nCommunal spaces, community activities, and close living quarters in multifamily housing increase the risk of getting and spreading the virus\nCOVID-19 is mostly spread person-to-person through respiratory droplets released when people cough, sneeze, or talk. Less commonly, COVID-19 may also be acquired when someone touches a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touches their nose, mouth, or eyes. COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms. Therefore, personal prevention practices such as social distancing, using masks, frequent handwashing with soap and water or hand sanitizing when handwashing with soap and water is not possible, cough etiquette, and staying home when sick, are important to reduce COVID-19. Other environmental prevention practices, such as environmental cleaning and disinfection, are also important. Administrators can take clear-cut actions to help lower the risk of COVID-19 exposure and spread in their communities and at their facilities.\n\nDevelop a plan\nDuring an infectious disease outbreak, such as the current outbreak of COVID-19, property owners, administrators, and operators should prepare to identify residents at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness, collaborate with their local health departments, and protect their employees\u2019 health and safety.\n\nSee CDC\u2019s guidance for preparing businesses and employees for the effects of COVID-19.\n\nConsider the unique needs of your residents, such as disabilities, cognitive decline, or lack of access to technology. This guidance does not address infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. If your facility offers healthcare services, consult CDC\u2019s Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings.\n\nState, territorial, local, and tribal public health departments can provide specific information on COVID-19 transmission and policies in your community, which can help you decide when and if you need to scale up or relax specific prevention measures.\n\nPromote behaviors that reduce spread\nEncourage residents and staff to practice behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19. An individualized approach for COVID-19 may be needed for people with physical or intellectual disabilities or who have difficulty accessing information. Some residents require close contact with direct service providers, (e.g., home care nurses, therapists, social workers, etc.), have trouble understanding information, have difficulties with changes in routines, or have other concerns related to their disability.\n\nSelf-isolate or quarantine when appropriate\nEducate residents on when they should stay home or self-isolate in their living quarters (e.g. during mandatory shelter-in-place orders, after possible exposure to COVID-19, or if showing symptoms of COVID-19).\nActively encourage those who have symptoms of COVID-19 or who are otherwise sick to stay home or in their living quarters unless seeking medical care.\nEncourage adherence to recommendations for animals, including pets or service animals present in the household or facility.\nConsider circumstances in which social distancing and self-isolating may be difficult for many people with disabilities.\nAnyone who has had close contact with a person with COVID-19 should stay home and monitor for symptoms for 14 days.\nEncourage mask wearing\nEncourage use of CDC-recommended masks among residents, workers, and visitors in common areas and in public.\nAdvise residents to avoid others who are not wearing masks or to ask others around them to wear masks.\nSome residents may not be able to wear masks or are recommended not to wear masks:\nWearing masks may be difficult for people with sensory, cognitive, or behavioral issues.\nMasks should not be worn by children under age 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, or is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.\nAdaptations and alternatives should be considered whenever possible to increase the feasibility of wearing a mask or to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading if it is not possible to wear one.\nEncourage social distancing\nIn general, interacting with more people, especially closely and for longer times, increases risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.\nAvoid gatherings of 10 or more people.\nEncourage social distancing by asking workers and residents who are not from the same household and visitors to stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) apart whenever possible.\nSocial distancing may be difficult for many people with disabilities.\n Avoid close contact with visitors. For example, don\u2019t shake hands, elbow bump or hug. Instead consider waving and verbal greetings.\nEnsure adequate supplies in common areas\nSupport healthy hygiene behaviors by providing supplies, including soap, hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, a way to dry hands, tissues, disinfectant wipes, masks (as feasible), and no-touch/foot pedal trash cans.\nDisplay relevant signs and messages\nPost signs in highly visible locations (e.g., building entrances, stairways, elevators) that promote everyday protective measures and describe how to stop the spread of germs (such as social distancing, by properly washing hands, proper cough etiquette, and properly wearing a mask).\nInclude messages (for example, videos, posters) about behaviors that prevent the spread of COVID-19 when communicating with residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors (such as on websites, in emails, in facility newsletters, and on social media accounts).\nFind free CDC print and digital resources on CDC\u2019s communications resources main page.\nIdentify and address potential language, cultural, and environmental barriers associated with communicating COVID-19 information. Consider developing communication materials in alternative formats (e.g., large print, braille, ASL) for people who have low vision or are blind or people who are deaf or hard of hearing.\nConsider developing communication materials for people with low literacy and using plain or easy to understand language or visuals.\nCommunications may need to be framed or adapted so they are culturally appropriate for your audience and easy to understand. CDC has communication resources available in many languages.\nMaintain healthy environments in common areas\nMultifamily housing complexes may consider several strategies to maintain healthy environments.\n\nEnsure adequate ventilation\nConsider conducting ventilation system upgrades or other steps to increase the delivery of clean air and dilute potential contaminants in the building. Obtain consultation from experienced Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) professionals when making changes to HVAC systems and equipment. Some of the recommendations below are based on the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Guidance for Building Operations During the COVID-19 Pandemicexternal icon. Review additional ASHRAE guidelines for multifamily buildingsexternal icon for further information on ventilation recommendations for different types of building and building readiness for occupancy. Not all steps are applicable for all scenarios.\n\nImprovement steps may include some or all of the following activities:\n\nIncrease outdoor air ventilation, using caution in highly polluted areas.\nIncrease outdoor air by opening windows and doors, when weather conditions allow. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk (e.g., risk of falling, triggering asthma symptoms) to persons using the facility.\nUse fans to increase the effectiveness of open windows. Position fans securely and carefully in or near windows to avoid potentially contaminated air flowing from one person to another. Strategic window fan placement in exhaust mode can help draw fresh air into room via other open windows and doors without generating strong room air currents.\nDecrease occupancy in common areas where outdoor ventilation cannot be increased.\nEnsure ventilation systems operate properly and provide acceptable indoor air quality for the current occupancy level for each space.\nIncrease total airflow supply to occupied spaces, when possible.\nDisable demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) controls that reduce air supply based on occupancy or temperature during occupied hours.\nFurther open minimum outdoor air dampers to reduce or eliminate HVAC air recirculation. In mild weather, this will not affect thermal comfort or humidity; however, this may be difficult to do in cold, hot, or humid weather.\nImprove central air filtration:\nIncrease air filtrationexternal icon to as high as possible without significantly diminishing design airflow.\nInspect filter housing and racks to ensure appropriate filter fit and check for ways to minimize filter bypass.\nCheck filters to ensure they are within service life and appropriately installed.\nConsider running the HVAC system at maximum outside airflow for 2 hours before and after the space is occupied.\nEnsure restroom exhaust fans are functional and operating at full capacity when the space is occupied.\nInspect and maintain local exhaust ventilation in areas such as restrooms, kitchens, cooking areas, or other areas of high occupancy.\nUse portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) fan/filtration systems to help enhance air cleaning, especially in higher risk areas such as common spaces.\nGenerate clean-to-less-clean air movement by re-evaluating the positioning of supply and exhaust air diffusers or dampers, especially in higher-risk areas such as common spaces.\nConsider using ultraviolet germicidal irradiationpdf iconexternal icon (UVGI) as a supplement to help inactivate SARS-CoV-2, especially if options for increasing room ventilation are limited.\n*Note: The ventilation intervention considerations listed above come with a range of initial costs and operating costs. There are also risk assessment parameters to consider, such as community incidence rates, face mask compliance expectations, and common room density. These factors may affect which interventions are implemented.\n\nEnsure safe water systems\nTo minimize the risk of lead or copper exposure, Legionnaires\u2019 disease, and other diseases associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (e.g., sink faucets, common area drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown.\nThese include plumbing flushing and following EPA\u2019s 3Ts, (Training, Testing, and Taking Action) for reducing lead in drinking waterexternal icon.\nIt may be necessary to conduct ongoing regular flushing after reopening. For additional resources, refer to EPA\u2019s Information on Maintaining or Restoring Water Quality in Buildings with Low or No Useexternal icon.\nDrinking fountains should be cleaned and sanitized, but encourage residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors to bring their own water to common areas to minimize use and touching of water fountains.\nPromote cleaning and disinfection\nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (e.g., door handles, handicap door access switches, sink handles, grab bars, hand railings,) within common areas of facilities at least daily or between use as much as possible.\nAdvise residents with sensory or respiratory issues to avoid these areas during and immediately after cleaning.\nLimit use of shared objects in common areas (e.g., computer equipment, remote controls, print materials) when possible, and clean and disinfect shared objects between use.\nDevelop a schedule for increased, routine cleaning and disinfection.\nProvide staff with training about the safe and correct use and storage of cleaners and disinfectants.\nUse products that meet EPA List N disinfection criteriaexternal icon. Use products according to the manufacturer\u2019s labeled directions.\nEncourage residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors to keep personal items (e.g., cell phones, other electronics), and personal work and living spaces clean.\nOffer assistance with cleaning and disinfecting for residents with disabilities who may require supervision\nEncourage residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors to use disinfectant wipes to wipe down objects and surfaces before and after use.\nEnsure safe congregate spaces\nModified layouts\n\nSocial distancing may be difficult for many people with disabilities.\nAlter schedules to reduce mixing and close contact, such as staggering activity times and forming small groups that regularly participate at the same times and do not mix with individuals in other groups.\nArrange seating of chairs and tables to be at least 6 feet apart during events.\nMinimize traffic in enclosed spaces, such as mailrooms, elevators, and stairwells.\nConsider limiting the number of individuals in an elevator at one time and designating one-directional stairwells and hallways, if possible.\nEnsure that social distancing can be maintained in communal spaces.\nPhysical barriers and guides\n\nInstall physical barriers, such as sneeze guards and partitions, particularly in areas where it is difficult for individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart (e.g., reception areas).\nProvide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls to ensure that individuals remain at least 6 feet apart. Use formats that are accessible to residents, including for those with visual impairments.\nSafe communal spaces\nSocial distancing may be difficult for many people with disabilities.\nClose indoor shared spaces such as game rooms, computer rooms, exercise rooms, and lounges if needed to ensure safety of the residents.\nOtherwise, stagger use and restrict the number of people allowed in at one time to ensure everyone can stay at least 6 feet apart, and clean and disinfect between use.\nPrioritize outdoor activities where possible.\nLimit the presence of non-essential volunteers and visitors in shared areas, when possible.\nClean and disinfect common-area bathrooms regularly (e.g., in the morning and evening, after times of heavy use) using EPA List N-registered disinfectantsexternal icon following the manufacturer\u2019s labeled directions.\nMaintain access and adequate supplies to laundry facilities. Restrict the number of people allowed in laundry rooms at one time to ensure everyone can stay at least 6 feet apart.\nConsider closing exercise rooms. Alternatively, stagger use, increase air flow by opening windows where possible, and clean and disinfect between use.\nConsider closing pools and hot tubs or limiting access to pools for essential activities only, such as water therapy. Consider additional prevention activities for public pools, hot tubs, and water playgrounds during COVID-19 for those that remain open.\nConduct maintenance and inspection visits\nTo the extent allowed by law or regulation consider:\n\nDeferring maintenance inside units for non-critical or non-life-threatening problems.\nDeferring routine in-unit inspections, especially for assisted units which may have regular mandatory inspections. Owners and operators of assisted units should be aware that authorities may have issued temporary waivers or guidance regarding inspections during the pandemic.\nMaintain healthy operations\nMultifamily housing complexes may consider several strategies to maintain healthy operations.\n\nProtections for residents and workers at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19\nOffer options for those at higher risk for severe illness (including older adults and people of all ages with certain underlying medical conditions) that limit their exposure risk (e.g., telework, modified job responsibilities, virtual participation in community events).\nConsistent with applicable law, put in place policies to protect the privacy of people at higher risk for severe illness regarding underlying medical conditions.\nRegulatory awareness\nBe aware of local or state regulatory agency policies related to multifamily housing to determine if events or activities can be held.\nIdentify strategies to maintain operations and a healthy working and living environment\nReview CDC\u2019s guidance for businesses and employers.\nIdentify an onsite coordinator who will be responsible for COVID-19 issues and their impact at the workplace.\nDevelop flexible sick leave policies for staff. Require staff to stay home when sick, even without documentation from doctors. Use flexibility, when possible, to allow staff to stay home to care for sick family or household members or to care for children in the event of school or childcare dismissals. Make sure that employees are aware of and understand these policies.\nCreate plans to protect the staff and residents from the spread of COVID-19 and help them put in place personal preventive measures.\nClean and disinfect shared areas (such as exercise room, laundry facilities, shared bathrooms, and elevators) and frequently touched surfaces using EPA List N-registered disinfectantsexternal icon more than once a day, if possible.\nIdentify services and activities (such as meal programs, in-person religious services, and exercise rooms and programs) that might need to be limited or temporarily discontinued. Consider alternative solutions (e.g., virtual services) that will help programs continue while being safe for residents.\nEstablish policies and practices for social distancing.\nIdentify a list of healthcare and mental health facilities and alternative care sites where residents with COVID-19 can receive appropriate care, if needed.\nCommunication systems\nIdentify platforms such as email, websites, hotlines, automated text messaging, newsletters, and flyers to help communicate information on:\n\nGuidance and directives from state and local officials and state and localexternal icon health departments.\nHow your facility is helping to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\nHow additional information will be shared, and where to direct questions.\nHow to stay healthy, including videos, fact sheets, and posters with information on COVID-19 symptoms and how to stop the spread of germs, how to wash your hands, and what to do if you are sick.\nHow residents can receive services such as food delivery if they are at higher risk for severe illness.\nHow staff and residents can cope and manage stress and protect others from stigma and discrimination.\nIdentify and address potential language, cultural, and disability barriers associated with communicating COVID-19 information. Communications may need to be framed or adapted so they are culturally appropriate for your audience and easy to understand. CDC has communication resources available in many languages.\nVisitors, service providers, and prospective tenants\nLoneliness and social isolation in older adults are serious health risk factors. However, because in-person social interactions are associated with increased risk of infection, owners and operators of multifamily communities are encouraged to promote safe social activities among community residents and their support networks.\n\nResidents should be encouraged to limit visitors to persons essential to maintaining their health, well-being, and safety.\nVisitors should avoid entering the building or community, including common areas and residences, unless their presence is essential to preserving the health, including mental health, well-being, and safety of residents. This can include a wide array of service providers or even community or family support networks of older adult residents.\nVisitors, service providers, and prospective tenants should follow personal protective measures and the recommendations set forth by the facility they are visiting, as well as local and state health directives.\nVisitors should also maintain social distance of at least six feet (2 meters) from residents to help reduce transmission.\nVisitors, service providers, and prospective tenants should not visit if they recently had contact with someone who had symptoms of COVID-19.\nVisitors should wear a mask while in the building and restrict their visit to the resident\u2019s room or other location designated by the facility. Everyone should be reminded to wash their hands frequently with soap and water or use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol when handwashing with soap and water is not possible.\nUnit turnover and move-ins\nFollow CDC\u2019s guidance on cleaning and disinfecting your home.\nSafely clean units and assist with unit turnovers and move-out/ins by learning how to protect yourself and others.\nNew units (especially high-touch surfaces) should be cleaned and disinfected using a disinfectant from the list of EPA List N-registered disinfectantsexternal icon. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s labeled directions.\nWait at least 24 hours since previous tenants left before cleaning and disinfecting in preparation for a new individual/family moving in. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible.\nAdditional suggestions include\nFrequent cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces, such as doorknobs, light switches, and faucets, during the moving process;\nLimiting the number of family members present during the move-in/out process;\nMaintaining social distancing between household members and movers and other residents;\nRequesting the proper use of masks;\nProviding handwashing materials \u2013 ideally soap, water and a way to dry hands if water is on in the unit, or hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol \u2013 and encouraging frequent hand hygiene;\nKeeping windows and doors open, if possible, to increase ventilation\nPrepare for when someone gets sick\nIf a resident in your multifamily housing unit has COVID-19 (suspected or confirmed)\nHave the resident contact a healthcare provider to determine whether medical evaluation is needed.\nResidents are not required to notify administrators if they think they may have or have a confirmed case of COVID-19.\nIf you do receive information that someone in your housing unit has COVID-19, work with the local health department to notify anyone in the unit who may have been exposed (had close contact with the sick person) while maintaining the confidentiality of the sick person as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and, if applicable, the Fair Housing Act, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\nProvide the sick person with information on how to care for themselves and when to seek medical attention.\nHelp address misunderstandings about why people are being asked for personal information, and why this information is important for stopping spread of COVID-19 among family, friends, and communities.\nEncourage residents with COVID-19 symptoms to self-isolate and their roommates and close contacts to quarantine. This includes limiting contact of residents with COVID-19 symptoms with any pets or service animals in the household or facility to protect them from possible infection.\nThose with COVID-19 symptoms and their close contacts should limit their use of shared spaces as much as possible.\nFollow guidance on when to stop isolation and when to end quarantine.\nMinimize the number of staff members who have face-to-face interactions with residents who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19.\nEncourage staff, other residents, caregivers such as outreach workers, and others who visit people with COVID-19 symptoms to follow recommended precautions to prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.\nStaff at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 should not have close contact with residents who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19, if possible.\nThose who have been in close contact (less than 6 feet or 2 meters) with a resident for a total of 15 minutes or more who has confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should monitor their health and call their healthcare provider if they develop symptoms suggestive of COVID-19.\nBe prepared to provide accessible transportation to people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 for testing or non-urgent medical care.\nAvoid transporting people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 using public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis unless it is the only accessible option. Follow guidelines for cleaning and disinfecting any transport vehicles.\nIf multiple cases are suspected, contact the local public health department to report the cases and to offer to an accessible community testing site, provide a platform for information-sharing, or share community insights.\nClean and disinfect\nClose off areas used by someone that has or may have COVID-19 and do not use these areas until after cleaning and disinfecting.\nWait at least 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting.\nIf 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible.\nProvide staff with training about the safe and correct use and storage of cleaning and disinfection products, including storing products securely away from children and pets.\nWatch for symptoms in residents and their family members\nPeople with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms, from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:\n\nFever or chills\nCough\nShortness of breath or difficulty breathing\nFatigue\nMuscle or body aches\nHeadache\nNew loss of taste or smell\nSore throat\nCongestion or runny nose\nNausea or vomiting\nDiarrhea\nThis list does not include all possible symptoms. CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19.\nIn some cases, older adults and people of any age with underlying health conditions may have symptoms that are not typically seen in others, or they may take longer than others to develop fever and other symptoms.",

            "Text": "As schools begin their fall semester, universities and colleges are struggling to contain coronavirus outbreaks, with cases reported at campuses in all 50 states.\n\nMore than 40,000 Covid-19 infections have been reported among students, faculty and staff at colleges and universities nationwide. The number represents cases that CNN has reported so far -- with the actual tally likely higher due to a lag from schools that update their data every few days. With social life trickling back to life on campuses, outbreaks have hit places students congregate, such as fraternities and sororities, where some have continued to gather despite remote learning.\nA cluster of Covid-19 cases was linked to a fraternity party at the University of New Hampshire. More than 100 people attended the August 29 event and few wore masks. Eleven people connected to the party have tested positive for the virus, university officials said. The University of Wisconsin-Madison is directing all undergraduate students to restrict their movements for the next two weeks in an attempt to reverse the rise in Covid-19 cases.\nIn a memo to students, faculty and staff this week, Chancellor Rebecca Blank called on students to severely limit in-person interactions and stay in their residences except for essential activities. The university directed nine campus fraternities and sororities with off-campus live-in houses to quarantine for at least 14 days.\nIllinois' Bradley University on Tuesday told all of its more than 4,500 students to quarantine in their on-campus or off-campus residences for two weeks, and to attend only online classes during that time, with allowances for meal pickups and other errands.\nThough the school had less than 50 positive cases on campus, those cases led to 500 people being put in quarantine, so the school said it decided to have everybody reset.\nAnd at Indiana University Bloomington, county health officials ordered 30 sorority and fraternity houses to quarantine last week following what campus officials have described as an \"alarming increase\" of positive Covid-19 tests within the houses.\nThe school directed Greek houses to suspend all in-person activities until at least Monday.\n\"IU's team of public health experts is extremely concerned that Greek houses are seeing uncontrolled spread of Covid-19,\" the university said. \"This poses a significant risk to the nearly 2,600 students currently living in Greek or other communal housing organizations, as well as to the other 42,000 IU Bloomington students, the campus's 12,000 faculty and staff, and the surrounding community.\"\nSome of the highest number of cases are at Miami University, University of South Carolina, Ohio State University and East Carolina University, all of which have over 1,000 confirmed cases. The University of Missouri has 862 confirmed cases while Missouri State University has 791, a CNN tally shows.\nWhile most students will likely recover, health experts have expressed concern that young people would spread the virus to the more vulnerable in their communities. Experts stress importance of flu vaccine during coronavirus pandemic\nAs cases accumulate on campuses, experts have warned that the country as a whole could see a resurgence of coronavirus cases this fall on top of flu season. A large concern is that the US could see the \"perfect storm of accelerated Covid-19 activity, as people gather more inside, in particular -- as they become continually fatigued with the mask wearing, the social distancing, and the hand hygiene, and as they are exposed to seasonal influenza,\" Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo said Thursday.\nMarrazzo, director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, made the comment during a briefing by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\n\"If there was ever a naysayer, someone who's never been vaccinated (for flu), now's the time to rise,\" Dr. Leonard Mermel, medical director for the Department of Epidemiology and Infection Control at Rhode Island Hospital, said at the same briefing. \"Get the vaccine and reduce the risk of having these two life-threatening viruses infect you at the same time, or infect one of your loved ones,\" he said.\nFor now, rates of new daily coronavirus infections reported nationwide have been dropping after a summer surge.\nThe seven-day average of new daily reported infections in the US was about 35,300 as of Wednesday, down from a peak average of 67,317 on July 22, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\nThe country's Covid-19 death rate also has dipped. The seven-day average of new daily deaths was 734 Wednesday, after it was above 1,000 from late July to August 20, JUH data show.\nCases aren't falling in every state. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said Wednesday that his state's statistics were \"getting worse by the day,\" and urged residents to do more to combat the spread.\nWest Virginia's seven-day average of new daily cases was 165 on Wednesday, up from around 100 at the end of August and around 50 at the start of July.\n\"This situation right now is really critical,\" Justice said. Giroir says he's 'never been told to slow down testing'\nThe coronavirus testing lead for the White House coronavirus task force said Thursday that he has never been told to slow testing, and the country is continuing to increase its testing capacity. \"I have never been told to slow down testing, or to reduce our efforts -- and in fact, we built on testing every single month,\" Adm. Brett Giroir, a physician and the assistant secretary for health at the US Department of Health and Human Services, told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta during a Research! America forum.\nHis comments come a day after experts said the US should be performing as many as 200 million Covid-19 tests every month to have any chance of controlling the pandemic. That report, from the Rockefeller Foundation and the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy, said fewer than 30 million tests are currently reported monthly in the country.\nGiroir said that \"this month, we should have the availability of over 100 million tests, and between 55% and 60% of those -- that's 55 to 60 million -- will be rapid point of care.\"\n\"This really puts us at an inflection point that we can really protect the elderly, we could protect the vulnerable, and we can do those kinds of screening testing for schools and work that we've been talking about for months now we have the tools to do that,\" Giroir told Gupta.\nDoctor expresses fury about 'misinformation'\nA frontline doctor is among those expressing fury over revelations that President Donald Trump downplayed the deadly threat from coronavirus early in the pandemic. In a series of interviews, Trump told investigative reporter Bob Woodward that he downplayed the danger because he didn't want people to panic.\nDr. Craig Spencer, the director of Global Health in ER Medicine at NY-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, expressed his anger at the disclosure.\n\"I'm furious because you want to talk about panic and wanting to reduce panic -- I think of the panic of every single family I called on FaceTime to let them know their family member was dying or had died,\" Spencer told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday. \"And I think about that multiplied by 190,000 times around this country.\"\nIt's \"almost impossible\" for health professionals to keep up with and correct the President's misinformatnion, he said.",

            "HeadLine": "Trump\u2019s Deliberate Coronavirus Deception",
            "Text": "Recordings, real or rumored, have been a leitmotif of the Trump era.\n\nThere was the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, in which Donald Trump confessed to his proclivity for serial sexual assault. The fabled \u201cpee tape,\u201d the existence of which would have been pornographic proof of Russiagate, haunted the first few years of the Trump presidency.\n\nJames Comey hoped there were recordings of what he described as Trump\u2019s mafia-like efforts to suborn him. (\u201cLordy, I hope there are tapes.\u201d) Michael Cohen released a tape in which the president assented to a scheme to buy the silence of a former Playboy model he allegedly slept with. Omarosa Manigault Newman had a tape in which she and two other Black Trump staffers worried about the existence of another tape, which she claimed had caught Trump using the vilest of racial slurs. The actor Tom Arnold had a whole cable series about his search, ultimately fruitless, for incriminating Trump tapes.\n\nTrump recordings loom so large because they offer the prospect of breaking through his alternative reality, of nailing down this most slippery and mendacious of presidents, of showing everyone who he really is. But even those that materialize are often quickly forgotten, as Trump\u2019s approval rating stays low but stubbornly stable and one scandal is eclipsed by another. Our politics suffers no shortage of incontrovertible proof of Trump\u2019s venality. What it lacks is accountability.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, maybe even likely, that the famed journalist Bob Woodward\u2019s utterly damning tapes of Trump discussing the coronavirus will fall into this same nothing-matters cycle. But decent people with public platforms should try to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that these tapes reveal the president lying about the pandemic that has ravaged America on his watch. What\u2019s shocking \u2014 even after more than three and a half numbing years \u2014 is the deliberate, willful nature of the lies. Unlike most Trump tapes, Woodward\u2019s actually tell us something new about the president, rather than just confirming what we think we already know.\n\nTHE ARGUMENTListen to our podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and Frank Bruni\nBecause Trump is a prodigious consumer of propaganda, as well as a creator of it, it\u2019s not always clear how aware he is of spreading disinformation. People who\u2019ve spent time with him often conclude that truth has no meaning for him. Woodward quoted Dan Coats, Trump\u2019s former director of national intelligence, saying: \u201cTo him, a lie is not a lie. It\u2019s just what he thinks. He doesn\u2019t know the difference between the truth and a lie.\u201d Trump creates for his supporters a carapace of malignant fantasy, but he often seems to live inside it with them.\n\nYet in recordings Woodward has released of Trump talking about the coronavirus \u2014 excerpts from interviews conducted for Woodward\u2019s new book, \u201cRage\u201d \u2014 the president doesn\u2019t sound ignorant or deluded. Rather, he sounds uncommonly lucid. On Feb. 7, Trump described the virus as airborne and \u201cmore deadly than even your strenuous flus,\u201d adding, \u201cthis is 5 percent versus 1 percent, or less than 1 percent.\u201d It\u2019s not clear whether Trump thought that Covid-19 had a 5 percent case fatality rate \u2014 a number that seemed plausible in February \u2014 but he clearly knew that compared with the flu, it was several times more likely to kill.\n\nAnd yet he told the country just the opposite. \u201cThe percentage for the flu is under 1 percent,\u201d Trump said on March 7. \u201cBut this could also be under 1 percent because many of the people that aren\u2019t that sick don\u2019t report.\u201d Despite knowing that the virus was airborne, he mocked mask-wearing and held several large indoor rallies. He told Woodward in March that \u201cplenty of young people\u201d were getting sick, but over the summer would insist that 99 percent of cases were \u201ctotally harmless\u201d and that children are \u201calmost immune.\u201d\n\nEditors\u2019 Picks\n\nA Man, a Pint and a Timer Become Symbols of Ireland\u2019s Pandemic Rules\n\nChess (Yes, Chess) Is Now a Streaming Obsession\n\n\u2018Dwarf Pride\u2019 Was Hard Won. Will a Growth Drug Undermine It?\nContinue reading the main story\nWe know now that this wasn\u2019t just Trump being buffoonish and engaging in magical thinking. It was conscious deception. Publicly, Trump kept insisting that the virus would disappear. Privately, he told Woodward: \u201cI wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down, because I don\u2019t want to create a panic.\u201d\n\nOf course, Trump usually loves creating panic \u2014 about immigrants, about antifa, about low-income people invading the suburbs. But there is one place he wants to maintain tranquility \u2014 in the financial markets. \u201cJust stay calm, it will go away,\u201d he said on March 10. \u201cWe want to protect our shipping industry, our cruise industry, cruise ships, we want to protect our airline industry.\u201d He added, \u201cA lot of good things are going to happen. The consumer is ready.\u201d\n\nAnd so Trump lied to the country about the calamity that would soon overtake it. His administration didn\u2019t ramp up a national testing or contact-tracing program. He and his supporters pressured states to open up prematurely. A July Pew poll found that only 46 percent of Republicans and those who lean toward the Republican Party considered the coronavirus a major threat to public health, compared with 85 percent of Democrats and Democratic leaners. Trump could have made Republicans take the virus seriously. He chose not to.\n\nNot long after attending the president\u2019s June rally in Tulsa, Okla., the former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain died of Covid-19. In August, whoever is maintaining Cain\u2019s Twitter account tweeted, \u201cIt looks like the virus is not as deadly as the mainstream media first made it out to be.\u201d It was Trump who made such a cultish commitment to denying the lethality of Covid-19 into a sign of loyalty. And all the time, he knew better.\n\nTrump supporters may not care that their president has knowingly endangered them, withholding potentially lifesaving information that he readily confided to an elite Washington journalist. But that doesn\u2019t change the importance of what Woodward has captured on tape. It\u2019s now clear that just because Trump is lying to us, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s lying to himself.\n\nTrump\u2019s lies sabotaged efforts to contain the coronavirus, almost certainly leading to many more deaths than it would have caused under a minimally competent and non-sociopathic leader. On Sept. 9, there were 1,176 coronavirus deaths in the United States. In Canada, there were two.\n\nWhen someone\u2019s actions lead to the death of another, we evaluate that person\u2019s intent and state of mind in order to assign the right measure of blame. When a president\u2019s actions lead to the deaths of thousands, we should do the same.",

            "Text": "In Michigan, Joe Biden pushed his plan to keep jobs in the United States. At the White House, President Trump laid out a list of people he\u2019d consider for the Supreme Court in a second term. President Trump acknowledged to the journalist Bob Woodward that he had knowingly played down the coronavirus earlier this year even though he was aware it was \u201cdeadly\u201d and vastly more serious than the seasonal flu.\n\n\u201cThis is deadly stuff,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Feb. 7 in one of a series of interviews Mr. Woodward conducted with the president for his upcoming book, \u201cRage.\u201d The Washington Post and CNN were given advance copies of the book and published details on Wednesday. CNN also provided audio of some of Mr. Trump\u2019s exchanges with Mr. Woodward.\n\n\u201cYou just breathe the air and that\u2019s how it\u2019s passed,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s a very tricky one. That\u2019s a very delicate one. It\u2019s also more deadly than even your strenuous flu.\u201d\n\nThat was a vastly different story than Mr. Trump was telling the public. In early March the president was suggesting on Twitter that the virus was less deadly than the flu. \u201cI wanted to always play it down,\u201d Mr. Trump told Mr. Woodward on March 19. \u201cI still like playing it down, because I don\u2019t want to create a panic.\u201d\n\nJoseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent, excoriated the president over the report. \u201cHe knew and purposely played it down,\u201d Mr. Biden said during a speech in Warren, Mich., Wednesday afternoon. \u201cWorse, he lied to the American people.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump did not deny the report in remarks at the White House later Wednesday. \u201cThe fact is I\u2019m a cheerleader for this country,\u201d he said, taking credit for imposing restrictions on travel from China. He said that he was trying to \u201cshow confidence\u201d with his public statements and rejected the suggestion that publicly minimizing the threat of the virus had cost lives.\n\nHe acknowledged speaking with Mr. Woodward, whose regular books on presidential administrations have a propensity for making news. \u201cI gave him some quotes, and frankly, we\u2019ll see how the book turned out,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d\n\nAccording to the book, the national security adviser, Robert C. O\u2019Brien, warned the president on Jan. 28 that the coronavirus represented the \u201cbiggest national security threat\u201d of his presidency, CNN reported, but Mr. Trump later said he did not remember the warning.\n\nAt the White House press briefing on Wednesday, shortly after the book\u2019s contents were made public in news reports, the press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, claimed that the president, who intentionally misled the public about the virus, had not lied. \u201cThis president does what leaders do, good leaders,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThe president has never lied to the American public on Covid.\u201d\n\nBut in public, Mr. Trump repeatedly claimed early on that the virus would disappear. On Jan. 22, asked by a CNBC reporter whether there were \u201cworries about a pandemic,\u201d the president replied: \u201cNo, not at all. We have it totally under control. It\u2019s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It\u2019s going to be just fine.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 10 he was predicting that by April, \u201cwhen it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away.\u201d And on Feb. 26, at a White House news conference, commenting on the country\u2019s first reported cases, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time. So we\u2019ve had very good luck.\u201d\n\nBut by mid-March he was claiming publicly that \u201cI felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.\u201d By then, experts said, the nation had already fallen behind on the steps it needed to take to combat the virus, from ramping up testing capability to distributing protective gear to health care workers.\n\nElsewhere in the book, according to CNN, the former defense secretary, Gen. James Mattis, is quoted calling Mr. Trump \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cunfit.\u201d He said he discussed with the former director of the office of national intelligence, Dan Coats, whether there should be \u201ccollective action\u201d to speak out publicly against Mr. Trump. And Mr. Woodward includes an anecdote about Mr. Trump being heard in a meeting saying, \u201cMy fucking generals are a bunch of pussies\u201d who care more about alliances than trade deals. WARREN, Mich. \u2014 Joseph R. Biden Jr., taking on President Trump over protecting American jobs, announced plans on Wednesday to change the tax code to discourage moving jobs overseas and to reward companies for investing in domestic production.\n\nBut before sketching out his plan, during a speech in the critical battleground state of Michigan, he took aim at Mr. Trump over new revelations from a forthcoming book by the journalist Bob Woodward that the president knowingly minimized the risks of the coronavirus to the American public.\n\n\u201cHe had the information,\u201d Mr. Biden said, accusing Mr. Trump of lying to the public. \u201cHe knew how dangerous it was. And while this deadly disease ripped through our nation, he failed to do his job on purpose. It was a life-and-death betrayal of the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s beyond despicable,\u201d Mr. Biden added, detailing the crises the nation faces as a result of the pandemic that go far beyond the staggering public health costs. \u201cIt\u2019s a dereliction of duty. It\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d\n\nDuring an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Mr. Biden used even sharper language to criticize Mr. Trump\u2019s contradictory message about the gravity of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cIt was all about making sure the stock market didn\u2019t come down, that his wealthy friends didn\u2019t lose any money,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cHe waved a white flag. He walked away. He didn\u2019t do a damn thing. Think about it. Think about what he did not do. It\u2019s almost criminal.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Mr. Biden ripped into the president\u2019s record on the economy, suggesting that Mr. Trump has not kept his promises to American workers about a range of issues, lashing his record on matters from job creation to keeping work in the United States rather than overseas.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s failed our economy and our country,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Biden also promised to take a series of executive actions to ensure the purchase of American goods in the federal procurement process.\n\nAs part of the new plans, Mr. Biden would create a tax penalty aimed at American companies that move jobs to other countries, known as offshoring. Mr. Biden has already proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent, from 21 percent. The penalty would apply to \u201cprofits of any production by a United States company overseas for sales back to the United States,\u201d bumping up the tax rate to nearly 31 percent on those profits.\n\nMr. Biden would also create a tax credit for companies that make domestic investments, such as revitalizing closed manufacturing plants, upgrading facilities or bringing back production from overseas.\n\n\u201cMake it in Michigan, make it in America, invest in our communities and the workers in places like Warren,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this is about.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden gave his speech in Warren, a city in Macomb County \u2014 a place associated with white working-class voters who traditionally voted Democratic but embraced Ronald Reagan and, later, Mr. Trump. He has intensified his efforts in recent months to unveil more populist policies aimed at boosting American workers. President Trump revealed a list of 20 people he will consider nominating to the Supreme Court if he wins a second term, reviving an election-year gimmick that he used during the 2016 campaign to win support among conservatives.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s new list includes three conservative Republican senators: Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri. (Mr. Hawley immediately took himself out of consideration, writing on Twitter that \u201cas I told the President, Missourians elected me to fight for them in the Senate, and I have no interest in the high court.\u201d) It also includes lawyers who work at the White House and the Justice Department, former solicitors general, and state and federal judges around the country.\n\n\u201cShould there be another vacancy on the Supreme Court during my presidency, my nominee will come from the names I have shared with the American public,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding that he will consider the remaining names from a similar list he released during the previous election.\n\nMr. Trump challenged Joseph R. Biden Jr. to release a similar list of names and accused him of failing to do so because of the \u201cextreme\u201d ideology that would be represented by his choices.\n\nMinutes after he was named to the list, Senator Cotton wrote on Twitter that \u201cIt\u2019s time for Roe v. Wade to go,\u201d weighing in directly on abortion rights, an issue that past nominees to the court have often tried to finesse. Speaking to reporters from the Diplomatic Reception Room in the White House, Mr. Trump predicted that the next president might have the opportunity to nominate \u201cone, two, three and even four\u201d justices.\n\nHe said that a Democratic president would stack the court with a \u201cradical left movement\u201d that would be bad for the country.\n\nDuring his four years in office, Mr. Trump has successfully secured the confirmation of two Supreme Court justices \u2014 Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 and more than 200 other federal judges, significantly shifting the judiciary to the right.\n\nIn addition to the senators, Mr. Trump\u2019s new list includes: Daniel Cameron, the attorney general of Kentucky; Paul Clement and Noel Francisco, who both served as United States solicitor general; Kate Comerford Todd, a deputy counsel in the White House; Christopher Landau, the ambassador to Mexico; and several federal and state judges. Democratic congressional leaders sent a letter to colleagues on Wednesday pleading with them to urge their constituents to vote as early as possible, citing their concerns that President Trump, with the help of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, is working to kneecap the Postal Service to ensure his own re-election.\n\n\u201cDemocrats need to convey a loud, clear message to voters about how to overcome these concerns: To prevent Donald Trump from stealing this election, VOTE,\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, wrote in an unusual letter sent from a campaign account rather than an official one. \u201cAmericans must vote as early as they can \u2014 especially if you plan to vote by mail.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has railed against mail-in voting, claiming that it will rig the election against him and asserting with no evidence that it is fraudulent. At the same time, Mr. DeJoy, installed in June by a board packed with Republican loyalists, has made operational changes at the Postal Service that have coincided with a mail-delivery slowdown.\n\nThe agency recently warned states that it might not have the ability to process all last-minute ballots, opening the possibility that hundreds of thousands mailed in the days leading up to the election could arrive too late to be counted. It has started a public education campaign to reassure Americans that the Postal Service can handle voting by mail and to urge those who plan to do so to send their ballots early. But its ads stop short of encouraging mail-in voting.\n\nIn their letter, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer encouraged Democratic lawmakers to direct their constituents to iwillvote.com, a website funded by the Democratic National Committee where people can register to vote and find out how to do so in person or by mail.\n\n\u201cThe best way to avoid lines, obstacles and delays is by not waiting until Election Day to vote,\u201d they wrote. \u201cStay vigilant: With President Trump actively working to undermine the legitimacy of voting by mail, we must remain vigilant against efforts to discourage or deceive voters.\u201d Should Bob Woodward have withheld a February quote from President Trump, who privately told him the coronavirus was \u201cdeadly stuff\u201d even as he publicly minimized its severity? Could Mr. Woodward have helped save lives by releasing the information sooner?\n\nThe revelation of Mr. Trump\u2019s characterization of the virus came Wednesday with the first reports about Mr. Woodward\u2019s new book, \u201cRage,\u201d which is due out next week. Mr. Trump shared the information in an interview with Mr. Woodward for the book about his presidency. It prompted a larger debate around journalistic ethics, with some arguing that Mr. Woodward, a lion of American journalism, had an obligation to report or share Mr. Trump\u2019s assessment sooner.\n\nIn the hours after CNN and The Washington Post, which were given advance access to the book, reported the quotations, many observers argued that the public had a right not only to the information about the deadly potential of the virus early on but also to the fact that Mr. Trump had been told the truth by experts and yet continued to mislead Americans. An often cited example is his comments in March comparing the coronavirus favorably to the seasonal flu.\n\nIt is estimated that the toll of Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, will soon reach 200,000 lives in the United States.\n\n\u201cTrump was the key vector of harmful misinformation,\u201d said Marc Ambinder, a former White House correspondent for National Journal, on Twitter. \u201cWe KNOW that his supporters BELIEVE HIM and altered their behavior because they thought COVID would be less harmful then the flu \u2026 cause that\u2019s what Trump said.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI\u2019m inclined to say that holding onto this is and was flat out wrong.\u201d Others defended Mr. Woodward. \u201cIf you believe that Woodward publishing Trump\u2019s quote in March would\u2019ve changed anything on Coronavirus the last four years have taught you absolutely nothing,\u201d said James Ball, the global editor of The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, on Twitter. Mr. Woodward did not reply to requests for comment Wednesday evening.\n\nWhile it is common for journalists and book authors to agree to hold back information or comments from sources until an agreed-upon date, Mr. Woodward told Margaret Sullivan, The Post\u2019s media columnist, on Wednesday that there was no such deal in place.\n\nRather, Mr. Woodward said, he declined to share the comment in February or March because he did not learn until May that it had come from an intelligence briefing. By then, he told The Associated Press on Wednesday, the quote\u2019s significance pertained to politics rather than public health, and the relevant deadline was the November election.\n\nHis ultimate goal, he told Ms. Sullivan, was to produce \u201cthe best obtainable version of the truth.\u201d\n\nMr. Woodward has chronicled several presidents since the 1970s, when, with his Post colleague Carl Bernstein, he helped expose the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s resignation. Though he has the title of associate editor at The Post, he is no longer a Post employee, a spokeswoman confirmed. A new poll shows most voters think Trump did a bad job on the virus and doubt he can help the country recover. With just eight weeks to go until Election Day, and early voting starting well before then, voters continue to disapprove of President Trump\u2019s coronavirus response and believe that Joseph R. Biden Jr. would do a better job handling the pandemic, according to a new poll from Monmouth University.\n\nOnly 37 percent of registered voters say Mr. Trump has done a good job handling the virus, and 56 percent say he has done a bad job. More broadly, only 27 percent say the country is heading in the right direction.\n\nForty-four percent say they are confident or somewhat confident that Mr. Trump can put the country \u201con the road to recovery\u201d from the pandemic, and 56 percent say they are not confident. The numbers are reversed for Mr. Biden, the Democratic nominee: 53 percent of voters say they are confident in his ability to put the country on the road to recovery, and 45 percent say they are not confident.\n\nA wide partisan gap persists on the question of whether officials are lifting restrictions too quickly or not quickly enough, but over all, 58 percent of registered voters said states were moving too fast.\n\n\u201cLabor Day generally serves as a marker for returning to a more normal flow of life,\u201d Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a news release. \u201cThat\u2019s not happening this year and could be leading to an increase in anxiety levels.\u201d\n\nThe poll, conducted from Sept. 3 to Sept. 8, surveyed 867 voters and has a margin of error of roughly plus or minus 3 percentage points. Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, took issue on Wednesday with President Trump\u2019s suggestion that a coronavirus vaccine would be available by Election Day, as he repeatedly sought to reassure senators and the public that a vaccine would not be made available to the public unless it was safe and effective.\n\n\u201cCertainly to try to predict whether it happens on a particular week before or after a particular date in early November is well beyond anything that any scientist right now could tell you and be confident they know what they are saying,\u201d Dr. Collins told the Senate Committee on Health, Education Labor and Pensions at a hearing on the effort to find a vaccine.\n\nDr. Collins is the latest leading medical expert to throw cold water on Mr. Trump\u2019s prediction. Last Thursday, the chief adviser for the White House vaccine program, Moncef Slaoui, said it was \u201cextremely unlikely but not impossible\u201d that a vaccine could be available by the end of October. And on Tuesday, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci said the same thing, saying that it was more likely that a vaccine could be ready by the end of the year.\n\nWednesday\u2019s hearing came amid growing concern over whether Americans would be reluctant to take a coronavirus vaccine, and whether the president would apply political pressure on his administration to quickly approve one to give him a boost in his re-election bid against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nOn Tuesday, a group of drug companies competing with one another to develop vaccines pledged that they would not release any vaccines that did not follow rigorous efficacy and safety standards, and a leading vaccine developer, AstraZeneca, suspended its large-scale clinical trial of a vaccine candidate after a patient experienced a severe adverse reaction.\n\nDemocrats on the panel grilled both Dr. Collins and Jerome Adams, the surgeon general, on the effect of Mr. Trump\u2019s overly rosy statements about the prospect of the vaccine, and whether they would erode trust in the development process. Dr. Collins demurred, however, as Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachussetts, asked him point blank whether Mr. Trump\u2019s misinformation would discourage people from taking the vaccine and hurt the effort to distribute it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I know the answer to that question,\u201d Dr. Collins said, adding, \u201cI just hope Americans will choose to take the information they need from scientists and not from politicians.\u201d An aviation company in Nevada on Wednesday withdrew its invitation to President Trump to hold a 5,000-person rally at its airport hangar, the first of two campaign events planned for this weekend that officials said would have violated Nevada\u2019s coronavirus restrictions.\n\nThe company, Hangar 9 L.L.C., had planned to host Mr. Trump on Saturday at its hangar at the Reno-Tahoe International Airport, but was told on Tuesday by airport officials that the event would have violated the terms of its lease, according to a letter sent by the airport authority.\n\nThe lease stipulates that the company must comply with all applicable state laws and directives, which means it has to follow a statewide order signed in May by Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, limiting gatherings to no more than 50 people, airport officials said.\n\n\u201cGiven the above, you are hereby advised that you may not proceed with the proposed gathering,\u201d Tina Iftiger, a senior vice president and chief commercial officer of the airport, wrote.\n\nClaude R. Cognian, a representative of Hangar 9, told airport officials on Wednesday that the company could not risk losing the lease for its hangar and would stand down, according to correspondence obtained by The New York Times.\n\n\u201cThen this leaves us with no other option than to communicate to President Trump and his campaign that we cannot help him/them and we are withdrawing the offer to use the hangar,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe Trump campaign had been scheduled to hold a similar rally on Sunday at a private jet charter company based at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, but an airport spokesman said that the authorities must approve any events on the property and that they had never received a request from the organizers.\n\nThe charter company that had been listed as the host of the event, Cirrus Aviation, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr. Trump, who lost Nevada by less than three percentage points in 2016, still plans to travel to the state this weekend, according to representatives of his campaign. They accused Democrats of short-circuiting the rallies.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are trying to keep President Trump from speaking to voters because they know the enthusiasm behind his re-election campaign cannot be matched by Joe Biden,\u201d Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, said.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Sisolak said that the governor\u2019s office had no involvement or communication with the event organizers or potential hosts of the two events, which the Trump campaign had been promoting. She noted that the White House\u2019s coronavirus task force had recommended limits on gatherings in Nevada.\n\nMr. Trump has been broadly criticized by public health authorities for defying guidelines meant to stop the transmission of the virus. He held a large indoor rally in June in Tulsa, Okla., and has recently been holding outdoor rallies at airport hangars: At one in North Carolina this week, he spoke before a large crowd and did not wear a mask, despite pleas from some local Republican officials that he follow the state\u2019s guidelines. Two national political conventions and days of protests and unrest following a police shooting in Kenosha, Wis., have done little to change the contours of the presidential campaign in that state, according to a Marquette Law School poll released Wednesday.\n\nThe new poll, of 688 likely Wisconsin voters, found that 47 percent planned to vote for Joseph R. Biden Jr. and 43 percent for President Trump, which is within the poll\u2019s margin of error. That represented a slight tightening from earlier Marquette polls: One in early August showed Mr. Biden leading Mr. Trump, 49 percent to 44 percent. The new survey had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.\n\n\u201cDespite all those real-world events, there is very little change in this poll,\u201d Charles Franklin, Marquette\u2019s poll director, said in a video accompanying the release.\n\nThe poll was made public as Wisconsin, a swing state that helped elect Mr. Trump in 2016, became the center of the campaign in recent days. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden traveled to Kenosha after the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, led to days of protests, and a 17-year-old white man was arrested on charges of killing two protesters. The new poll was conducted from Aug. 30 to Sept. 3, so it did not fully reflect the impact of their visits.\n\nA majority \u2014 54 percent \u2014 of respondents said that they disapproved of Mr. Trump\u2019s handling of protests, while only 36 percent said they approved, the poll found. And 56 percent said that they disapproved of Mr. Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus. But Mr. Trump is still viewed favorably on the economy: Fifty-two percent said that they approved of his handling of it.\n\nA new poll of another key battleground state, Pennsylvania, showed Mr. Biden in the lead there. The NBC News/Marist poll found Mr. Biden leading Mr. Trump among likely voters by 53 percent to 44 percent.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s lead there was due in part to strong support from suburban voters \u2014 which were key to Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in 2016 \u2014 and voters with college degrees, according to the poll of 771 likely Pennsylvania voters, which was conducted from Aug. 31 to Sept. 7. Mr. Biden leads Mr. Trump among suburban voters by nearly 20 percentage points.\n\nAmong independents, Mr. Biden leads Mr. Trump 57 percent to 35 percent. The two are tied with white voters, but Mr. Biden has a commanding lead among nonwhite voters, 75 percent to 19 percent. Mr. Biden also leads among women, 59 percent to 38 percent.\n\nThe poll has a margin of error of about four percentage points.\n\n\u2014 Michael Cooper and Sydney Ember\nTrump\u2019s campaign was badly outraised by Biden and the Democrats last month. President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee and their shared committees reported raising over $210 million in the month of August, a large amount that was nonetheless dwarfed by what Joseph R. Biden Jr. raised in the same time frame.\n\nAnd officials declined to say how much cash they have in the bank, which is a key marker of what they can spend on going forward.\n\nMr. Biden and affiliated Democratic committees reported raising $364.5 million in August. They also have not yet said how much they have in cash on hand.\n\nThe momentum for Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign in fund-raising and the polls came as a once-seemingly insurmountable cash advantage for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign has evaporated. Biden ad looks to keep focus on Trump\u2019s reported remarks disparaging American soldiers.\nUsually, presidential campaign TV advertising aims to influence voters in battleground states. But in the Trump era, more ads are targeting a far narrower audience: Washington\u2019s chattering class and President Trump, America\u2019s cable news watcher-in-chief.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the Democratic National Committee and the presidential campaign of Joseph R. Biden Jr. bought TV airtime in Washington to debut an ad touting report last week in The Atlantic that Mr. Trump privately referred to American soldiers killed in combat as \u201closers\u201d and \u201csuckers.\u201d The Message\nSince The Atlantic\u2019s story broke last Thursday, the Biden campaign has done whatever it can to give it oxygen. Mr. Biden addressed it in a speech on Friday and brought it up again during a Labor Day event. His campaign has sent fund-raising emails soliciting donations off the president\u2019s comments and circulated other news outlets\u2019 reporting confirming the gist of the original report.\n\nNow, six days after it first popped, the Biden campaign is trying to keep the story in Washington\u2019s bloodstream.\n\nThe 60-second ad opens with black-and-white footage of soldiers and a reminder that 1,800 Marines died at the battle of Belleau Wood in World War I.\n\n\u201cBut when Donald Trump was asked to pay his respects, he said, \u2018Why should I go to that cemetery? It\u2019s filled with losers,\u2019\u201d the ad intones, with an on-screen graphic citing The Atlantic\u2019s reporting.\n\nThe ad goes on to cite Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks calling Senator John McCain \u201ca loser\u201d and his wondering aloud \u201cwhat was in it for\u201d those buried at Arlington National Cemetery, before stating, \u201cDonald Trump inherited everything, sacrificed nothing, scoffs at the valor of those who gave it all for America.\u201d\n\nFact Check\nMr. Trump did in fact call Mr. McCain a \u201closer\u201d and said of Mr. McCain during a July 2015 campaign stop in Iowa: \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero. He\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump and his top White House aides have denied The Atlantic report, but the thrust of it has been confirmed by several competing news organizations, including Fox News, and no current senior military officer has refuted it.\n\nWhere It\u2019s Running\nSo far, just once: in Washington during the 6 a.m. hour of \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on MSNBC, an hour at which Mr. Trump is known to be channel surfing. A Democratic National Committee official said the ad would also air in Arizona, Florida, Maine, North Carolina and Virginia.\n\nThe Takeaway\nEvery day that the presidential campaign is about Mr. Trump and not Mr. Biden is a good one for the Biden campaign. Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks about America\u2019s veterans have been Topic A in Washington for nearly a week now, and the Biden campaign is happy to keep the conversation going.\n\n\u2014 Reid J. Epstein\nThe go-to Republican election lawyer called Trump\u2019s claims of voting fraud \u2018unsustainable.\u2019\nBenjamin L. Ginsberg is one of the top election lawyers in the nation, the go-to attorney for Republicans in nearly every major election law battle over the past 38 years \u2014 most famously, the Florida recount in 2000 in the disputed presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Mr. Ginsberg won that one. His reputation as an expert in this (often deliberately) complicated field of law crosses party lines.\n\nWhich makes an op-ed that Mr. Ginsberg wrote in The Washington Post striking. Mr. Ginsberg \u2014 who perhaps not coincidentally has the freedom that comes from having just retired from his law firm \u2014 flatly disputed President Trump\u2019s assertions that mail-in voting is \u201cvery dangerous\u201d and that \u201cthere is tremendous fraud involved and tremendous illegality.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lack of evidence renders these claims unsustainable,\u201d Mr. Ginsberg wrote. \u201cThe truth is that after decades of looking for illegal voting, there\u2019s no proof of widespread fraud. At most, there are isolated incidents \u2014 by both Democrats and Republicans. Elections are not rigged.\u201d\n\nThese are \u201cpainful conclusions for me to reach,\u201d Mr. Ginsberg said, noting his own work in a catalog of redistricting and voter recount cases on behalf of his party, and that he served as the counsel to the Republican National Committee and to four of the past six Republican presidential nominees.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s rhetoric has put my party in the position of a firefighter who deliberately sets fires to look like a hero putting them out,\u201d he wrote. \u201cRepublicans need to take a hard look before advocating laws that actually do limit the franchise of otherwise qualified voters. Calling elections \u2018fraudulent\u2019 and results \u2018rigged\u2019 with almost nonexistent evidence is antithetical to being the \u2018rule of law\u2019 party.\u201d\n\nHow significant is this? Well, imagine if Jerry Brown, the former Democratic governor of California and longtime environmental warrior, wrote an op-ed for The Sacramento Bee arguing that global warming doesn\u2019t exist.",

            "HeadLine": "How the Coronavirus Attacks the Brain",
            "Text": "It\u2019s not just the lungs \u2014 the pathogen may enter brain cells, causing symptoms like delirium and confusion, scientists reported. The coronavirus targets the lungs foremost, but also the kidneys, liver and blood vessels. Still, about half of patients report neurological symptoms, including headaches, confusion and delirium, suggesting the virus may also attack the brain.\n\nA new study offers the first clear evidence that, in some people, the coronavirus invades brain cells, hijacking them to make copies of itself. The virus also seems to suck up all of the oxygen nearby, starving neighboring cells to death.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the virus gets to the brain or how often it sets off this trail of destruction. Infection of the brain is likely to be rare, but some people may be susceptible because of their genetic backgrounds, a high viral load or other reasons.\n\n\u201cIf the brain does become infected, it could have a lethal consequence,\u201d said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University who led the work.\n\nThe study was posted online on Wednesday and has not yet been vetted by experts for publication. But several researchers said it was careful and elegant, showing in multiple ways that the virus can infect brain cells.\n\nScientists have had to rely on brain imaging and patient symptoms to infer effects on the brain, but \u201cwe hadn\u2019t really seen much evidence that the virus can infect the brain, even though we knew it was a potential possibility,\u201d said Dr. Michael Zandi, consultant neurologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Britain. \u201cThis data just provides a little bit more evidence that it certainly can.\u201d Dr. Zandi and his colleagues published research in July showing that some patients with Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, develop serious neurological complications, including nerve damage. In the new study, Dr. Iwasaki and her colleagues documented brain infection in three ways: in brain tissue from a person who died of Covid-19, in a mouse model and in organoids \u2014 clusters of brain cells in a lab dish meant to mimic the brain\u2019s three-dimensional structure.\n\nOther pathogens \u2014 including the Zika virus \u2014 are known to infect brain cells. Immune cells then flood the damaged sites, trying to cleanse the brain by destroying infected cells.\n\nThe coronavirus is much stealthier: It exploits the brain cells\u2019 machinery to multiply, but doesn\u2019t destroy them. Instead, it chokes off oxygen to adjacent cells, causing them to wither and die.\n\nThe researchers didn\u2019t find any evidence of an immune response to remedy this problem. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a silent infection,\u201d Dr. Iwasaki said. \u201cThis virus has a lot of evasion mechanisms.\u201d These findings are consistent with other observations in organoids infected with the coronavirus, said Alysson Muotri, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, who has also studied the Zika virus.\n\nThe coronavirus seems to rapidly decrease the number of synapses, the connections between neurons. \u201cDays after infection, and we already see a dramatic reduction in the amount of synapses,\u201d Dr. Muotri said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet if that is reversible or not.\u201d\n\nThe virus infects a cell via a protein on its surface called ACE2. That protein appears throughout the body and especially in the lungs, explaining why they are favored targets of the virus.\n\nPrevious studies have suggested, based on a proxy for protein levels, that the brain has very little ACE2 and is likely to be spared. But Dr. Iwasaki and her colleagues looked more closely and found that the virus could indeed enter brain cells using this doorway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that it is expressed in the neurons and it\u2019s required for entry,\u201d Dr. Iwasaki said.\n\nHer team then looked at two sets of mice \u2014 one with the ACE2 receptor expressed only in the brain, and the other with the receptor only in the lungs. When researchers introduced the virus into these mice, the brain-infected mice rapidly lost weight and died within six days. The lung-infected mice did neither.\n\nDespite the caveats attached to mouse studies, the results still suggest that virus infection in the brain may be more lethal than respiratory infection, Dr. Iwasaki said.\n\nThe virus may get to the brain through the olfactory bulb \u2014 which regulates smell \u2014 through the eyes or even from the bloodstream. It\u2019s unclear which route the pathogen is taking, and whether it does so often enough to explain the symptoms seen in people.\n\n\u201cI think this is a case where the scientific data is ahead of the clinical evidence,\u201d Dr. Muotri said.\n\nResearchers will need to analyze many autopsy samples to estimate how common brain infection is and whether it is present in people with milder disease or in so-called long-haulers, many of whom have a host of neurological symptoms.\n\nForty percent to 60 percent of hospitalized Covid-19 patients experience neurological and psychiatric symptoms, said Dr. Robert Stevens, a neurologist at Johns Hopkins University. But the symptoms may not all stem from the virus\u2019s invasion of brain cells. They may be the result of pervasive inflammation throughout the body.\n\nFor example, inflammation in the lungs can release molecules that make the blood sticky and clog up blood vessels, leading to strokes. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for the brain cells themselves to be infected for that to occur,\u201d Dr. Zandi said.\n\nBut in some people, he added, it may be low blood oxygen from infected brain cells that leads to strokes: \u201cDifferent groups of patients may be affected in different ways,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite possible that you\u2019ll see a combination of both.\u201d\n\nSome cognitive symptoms, like brain fog and delirium, might be harder to pick up in patients who are sedated and on ventilators. Doctors should plan to dial down sedatives once a day, if possible, in order to assess Covid-19 patients, Dr. Stevens said.",

            "Text": "On Feb. 7, during a taped interview with Bob Woodward, President Trump acknowledged that the coronavirus could be transmitted through the air, that it was very dangerous and that it would be difficult to contain. \u201cThis is deadly stuff,\u201d he told the investigative journalist.\n\n\u201cYou just breathe the air, and that\u2019s how it\u2019s passed,\u201d the president warned.\n\nDespite his apparent understanding of the severity of the disease and its method of transmission, over the next month, in five cities around the country, Mr. Trump held large indoor rallies, which were attended by thousands of his supporters.\n\nMr. Trump spent weeks insisting in public that the coronavirus was no worse than a seasonal flu. It would \u201cdisappear\u201d when the seasons changed, he promised in late February. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a great job,\u201d he said in early March.\n\nWhy lie to the American people? Why \u2014 as the administration accuses the Chinese government of doing \u2014 lie to the world about the severity of what was declared a pandemic only days later?\n\n\u201cI wanted to always play it down,\u201d Mr. Trump told Mr. Woodward on March 19. \u201cI still like playing it down, because I don\u2019t want to create a panic.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump and a great many of his supporters and political allies did play down the severity of the coronavirus and did criticize the public health measures deployed to prevent its spread. As a result, the coronavirus spread faster and sickened or killed more people in the United States than in any of its peer nations. If the United States had the same coronavirus fatality rate as Canada, more than 100,000 Americans could still be alive today.\n\nMake sense of the moment.\nOne day only: Subscribe for $1 a week.\nMuch of the responsibility for the fatal mishandling of the pandemic lies with the president. But with every public lie out of Mr. Trump\u2019s mouth, or on his Twitter feed, how many members of his administration who knew better stayed silent?\n\nThe president has repeatedly tried to muzzle and sideline scientists and health officials who disagree with his sunny assessments, often replacing them with less qualified people willing to sing his praises.\n\nSo it was that the president\u2019s coronavirus task force revised guidelines on testing for asymptomatic people, while the task force\u2019s leading infectious disease doctor, Anthony Fauci, was having surgery. So it is that, in the pandemic\u2019s seventh month, Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist with no background in infectious disease outbreaks, is arguing that it\u2019s not the government\u2019s job to stamp out the coronavirus, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention remain silent.\n\nEditors\u2019 Picks\n\nA Man, a Pint and a Timer Become Symbols of Ireland\u2019s Pandemic Rules\n\nThe Photographer Capturing Unvarnished Truths\n\nJane Fonda, Intergalactic Eco-Warrior in a Red Coat\nContinue reading the main story\nMr. Trump\u2019s lack of leadership almost certainly made the nation\u2019s suffering greater, its death toll higher and its economic costs more severe in the long term. When the president dithered on testing and contact tracing, when he failed to make or execute a clear and effective plan for securing personal protective equipment, when he repeatedly belittled and dismissed mask mandates and other social distancing edicts, Mr. Trump knew the virus was deadly and airborne. He knew that millions of people could get sick, and many would die.\n\nFurthermore, Mr. Woodward\u2019s tapes make clear that members of the Trump administration failed to act \u2014 even behind the scenes \u2014 based on what they knew at the time.\n\nNearly 200,000 people in the United States have already died, and hundreds of thousands more have suffered grave illness \u2014 often followed by a slow, hard recovery and, in some cases, permanent disability. Tens of millions of people have lost their jobs, and millions are on the cusp of losing their homes. School systems and elder care networks are struggling to function. The economy is in tatters.\n\nImagine what this picture could look like today had the president been honest with the American public on Feb. 7, calmly taken charge of the nation\u2019s response to the pandemic and done his best to protect them.",

            "HeadLine": "Summer Jet-Setters Turned Sardinia Into a Virus Hot Spot",
            "Text": "ROME \u2014 The allure of the turquoise waters, extravagant villas and exclusive dance clubs of the Emerald Coast of Sardinia proved stronger than ever in August, as Italian tourists hungry for virus-free air mingled with regulars of the international party circuit hopping across from places like the Spanish island of Ibiza and Mykonos in the Aegean Sea.\n\nThey joined Silvio Berlusconi, the mogul who dominated Italian politics for a quarter-century and whose Sardinian refuge is worthy of a Roman emperor; and his businessman friend Flavio Briatore, an acquaintance of President Trump, biological father of Heidi Klum\u2019s first child and owner of the island\u2019s unapologetically hedonistic club Billionaire.\n\nNow Mr. Berlusconi, 83, lies in a Milan hospital with pneumonia after contracting the coronavirus. Mr. Briatore, who dropped in to pay him a visit at his Sardinian estate and who had publicly complained about what he said was an overreaction by the government to the pandemic, is quarantined in Milan with Covid-19, too.\n\nIt is not clear when or how Mr. Berlusconi or Mr. Briatore were infected. But local officials say that Billionaire and a few other clubs ignored health regulations and became the petri dish of an island epidemic that infected soccer coaches, socialites and showgirls as it spread to the mainland.\n\nMr. Briatore\u2019s club says that it did more than was asked of it and blamed a sensationalist news media for jumping to conclusions.\n\nWhat is for sure is that the number of daily cases in Sardinia shot up from a few new infections a day before August to about 100 a day. The health authorities in Lazio, the region that includes Rome, said on Wednesday that people returning from Sardinia this summer constituted about half \u2014 some 1,250 people \u2014 of the total number of cases that had originated outside the region since the beginning of the outbreak. Since March, there have been more than 12,500 cases in Lazio and more than 2,600 in Sardinia, according to official figures. Roberto Ragnedda, the mayor of the Sardinian town of Arzachena, where many of the clubs are, said \u201c10 days of madness\u201d in August had caused \u201cenormous damage to our image and to economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the owners of the clubs were more careful these outbreaks could have been avoided,\u201d he said, adding that, despite having gotten the outbreak under control, \u201cwe are seen as the source of everything wrong.\u201d For the authorities in Sardinia, the summer realized their worst nightmare.\n\nIn March, as infections and deaths exploded in the country\u2019s north, the southern island\u2019s governor, Christian Solinas, pleaded with the authorities in Rome to ban travel to Sardinia because Italians, especially those with a second home there, kept arriving. The government obliged.\n\nAs a result, Sardinia essentially dodged the Covid-19 disaster. In mid-April, when Italy reached more than 170,000 total cases for the virus, Sardinia had about 1,000.\n\nOver the ensuing months, the virus all but vanished from the island, with zero new infections on May 14. Mr. Solinas vowed to keep it that way and at the time proposed requiring a \u201csanitary passport,\u201d essentially a sticker certifying a negative coronavirus test result attached to a boat or plane ticket. The government called it unconstitutional, and ultimately, tourists only had to register via an online form on the region\u2019s website.\n\nStill, it seemed sufficient. Mr. Solinas, using powers given by the national government, decided to reopen outdoor nightclubs, as long as people danced at a distance.\n\nBut August has been Sardinia\u2019s hot season since the 1960s, when the Aga Khan, the spiritual leader of some 20 million Ismaili Muslims worldwide and an enthusiastic jet-setter, banded together with friends to buy miles of northeastern coastal land from herders and developed luxurious hotels, yacht and golf clubs and a village in medieval Moorish style along what became known as the Emerald Coast. This year, it became Italy\u2019s viral hot spot; \u201cthe Emerald Covid,\u201d according to one headline in the newspaper Corriere della Sera.\n\nThe authorities are investigating partygoers for leaving false names and numbers at clubs to avoid contact tracing. The Italian civil protection agency complained about a 5 a.m. incident at the Just Cavalli nightclub of the zebra-print fashion house Roberto Cavalli, in which a man broke the nose of a volunteer for blocking his yellow Mercedes and \u201cruining his holiday.\u201d Johnny Micalusi, a Rome-based celebrity chef known as the King of Fish and for schmoozing with his famous guests at their tables, was hospitalized with Covid-19 after working out of a Sardinian club.\n\nCORONAVIRUS SCHOOLS BRIEFING: It\u2019s back to school \u2014 or is it?\nSign Up\nBut according to Mr. Ragnedda, the \u201cmost egregious\u201d offender was Mr. Briatore, at whose club he once delivered drinks while working his way through law school.\n\nMr. Briatore declined a request for an interview through Patrizia Spinelli, a spokeswoman for his Billionaire Life brand. (\u201cWe didn\u2019t just create a company, we built a lifestyle\u201d is its motto.) She said the club was not responsible: \u201cWe are victims of the situation, too, and took all the precautions.\u201d\n\nShe noted that the club had gone above and beyond health regulations, limiting its season to a single month, specially training its staff and halving the number of tables for the dinner show it developed to replace the usual disco.\n\nShe said Mr. Ragnedda forced the club to close early by banning the loud music necessary in a song and dance performance that people expected with their dinner.\n\n\u201cWe are all about music and energy,\u201d she said. But according to Mr. Ragnedda, the \u201cmost egregious\u201d offender was Mr. Briatore, at whose club he once delivered drinks while working his way through law school.\n\nMr. Briatore declined a request for an interview through Patrizia Spinelli, a spokeswoman for his Billionaire Life brand.

She said that 27 infected members of the club\u2019s staff were isolated in single rooms at the company\u2019s expense in the Billionaire residences, and confirmed that about 30 contractors had also been infected.\n\nMr. Briatore is in quarantine after discovering his infection during an Aug. 22 checkup for an unrelated ailment. This week, he assured his Instagram followers, \u201cI have not disappeared,\u201d and said that he was in \u201csuper form.\u201d\n\nMr. Briatore, a convicted card cheat and fixer of Formula 1 motor races, is also the star of the Italian version of \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was only one person that I wanted. And that was Flavio,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a promo for the Italian show. In another spot, the two men appear together at Trump Tower, firing each other. Mr. Briatore once claimed of Mr. Trump that he had been \u201cthe first to bring him to Europe\u201d but has since downgraded their relationship status to a publicity stunt.\n\nMr. Briatore, who usually wears a white beard and black T-shirts, has bristled at the attacks on Billionaire, telling Italian reporters that his club \u201calways respected the rules.\u201d\n\nBut videos on social media depicting less-than-quiet sit-down dinners have caused an uproar.\n\nIn one, a train of women transport champagne bottles loaded with sparklers through thumping music and a sweaty crowd. Almost nobody is wearing a mask.\n\nIn a social media post a few days before his coronavirus diagnosis, Mr. Briatore, 70, attacked a virologist for speaking badly about his club, saying that such scientists had \u201cterrorized Italy.\u201d \u201cLet us work,\u201d Briatore said in another post on May 31. \u201cThe coronavirus provides insurance for this government, they are scaring everyone, and since everything has been going down since June, they start scaring people for September,\u201d he added. He also cited a comment made by his doctor, Alberto Zangrillo, who has said, \u201cCovid clinically no longer exists; someone is terrorizing the country.\u201d (Dr. Zangrillo later said that he had been speaking loosely and that he believes the virus is real.)\n\nDr. Zangrillo is also the personal doctor of Mr. Berlusconi, who is in a Milan hospital where his condition is said to be improving.\n\nMr. Briatore visited Mr. Berlusconi at his Villa Certosa on Aug. 11.\n\n\u201cVisit to a special friend,\u201d Mr. Briatore titled an Instagram post documenting the sumptuous seaside estate. In the post, Mr. Briatore pays tribute, saying he found Mr. Berlusconi in \u201cgreat form.\u201d\n\n\u201cA heartfelt thanks,\u201d Mr. Berlusconi replied.\n\nAfter making a political career out of victimization, Mr. Berlusconi this week seemed to have found a once-in-a-lifetime enemy: his coronavirus infection.\n\nIn a call on Tuesday to members of his party, Forza Italia, he said that hoped to return to political battle and that, out of all the thousands of tests conducted at the Milan hospital since the start of the epidemic, \u201cI have come out in the top five in terms of the strength of the virus.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fighting to beat this infernal disease,\u201d Mr. Berlusconi added, \u201cIt\u2019s very ugly.\u201d",

            "Text": "Corona dorms and student spreaders\nCases of coronavirus are spiking on university campuses, leaving administrators with two unappealing options: Quarantine students in dorms, or send them home.\n\nThe University of Alabama said it had recently posted university police officers at its quarantine dorms while Notre Dame said it had hired guards to monitor students in quarantine in hotels and off-campus apartments. And perhaps unsurprisingly, many schools are having trouble running what are essentially disease containment units.\n\nAt the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Brianna Hayes was assigned to a quarantine dorm after developing a fever. Two days later, the university informed her that she had tested positive and would need to move again, to a Covid-19 isolation dorm.\n\nThere was no university staff in the dorm to help sick students, Ms. Hayes said, and no elevator. Feverish and exhausted from the virus, she made four trips up and down staircases to move her bedding and other belongings to her isolation room. During her week in isolation, she said, no one from the university came to check on her.\n\n\u201cI felt like everyone was only interested in how I was affecting others, like who I came in contact with, and then I was just left to be sick,\u201d she told our colleague Natasha Singer.\n\nAs our sister newsletter The Morning noted, the alternative to quarantine dorms may be even worse: Sending potentially sick students back home, where they may spread the virus. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst thing you could do,\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci, the federal government\u2019s leading infectious disease expert, said on the \u201cToday\u201d show.\n\nSusan Dynarski, a University of Michigan economist, wrote on Twitter that \u201cunloading students onto home communities\u201d was \u201cdeeply unethical.\u201d\n\nAs outbreaks bloom from illegal student parties and the virus spreads through the dorms, colleges are the new meatpacking plants.\n\n\nImage The State University of New York at Oneonta ended in-person classes last week and sent students home after more than 650 people tested positive.\n\nNew York University has suspended some students (and might suspend more) after a gathering in Washington Square Park.\n\nWest Virginia University suspended some students after several large fraternity parties. It shifted most undergraduate classes online until late September.\n\nLast week, Northeastern University dismissed 11 freshmen from campus for the semester after an unmasked gathering. The school will not be refunding the $36,500 in tuition and fees they paid.\n\nIndiana University has identified 1,370 positive cases since Aug. 22, a vast majority on the flagship Bloomington campus.\n\nMore than 700 students at Florida State University tested positive in the past week. Right now, the Tallahassee metro area has the tenth-biggest spike in per-capita cases nationwide.\n\nRate my dashboard: Two professors at the Yale School of Medicine have started a Twitter account to evaluate coronavirus dashboards at universities. Think Room Rater, but for public health.\n\nEditors\u2019 Picks\n\nA Man, a Pint and a Timer Become Symbols of Ireland\u2019s Pandemic Rules\n\nJane Fonda, Intergalactic Eco-Warrior in a Red Coat\n\nChess (Yes, Chess) Is Now a Streaming Obsession\nContinue reading the main story\nHacking virtual learning\nThis school year already looked different \u2014 instead of buses and homeroom, it\u2019s Zoom rooms and social distanced desks. Now, even virtual spaces are feeling precarious.\n\nAdministrators in Hartford, Conn., had prepared for a hybrid reopening on Tuesday. But a ransomware attack \u2014 in which hackers locked people out of their networks and demanded big payments to get back in \u2014 forced the district to postpone classes for nearly 18,000 students. Schools reopened Wednesday.\n\nThat\u2019s not an isolated incident. Technology problems hindered 200,000 students in Houston and thousands more in Virginia Beach. Kids can\u2019t log on to supposedly secure portals. Video chats kick them out. Computers stall. Error messages multiply. Systems overload.\n\nThere were glitches and attacks well before Labor Day. There was a server issue in Philadelphia. A statewide outage in North Carolina. A teenage hacker choked the nation\u2019s fourth-largest school district, Miami-Dade County, for days.\n\nEven without hacks, students struggle to concentrate. Those with learning challenges have an even harder time. Younger children and children with special needs miss crucial social and emotional development socializing on Zoom. Kids starting new schools don\u2019t know how to make friends. And lower-income children may not have reliable internet or device access in the first place. \u201cI am at the point where I will have to let them fail Spanish, P.E. and music, because I can\u2019t manage their two schedules full-time on top of my full-time job,\u201d said Ally Fonte, a parent whose two sons attend school in Miami-Dade County, Fla.\n\nRead More: The 74 profiled the man running tech support for the San Antonio school district. His dedication to the \u201cbabies,\u201d his 48,000 students, has kept the district afloat.\n\nTests for kids? Good luck\nAs many parents have discovered, getting a kid tested for Covid-19 is no easy task. Even in large cities with many test sites, parents are spending hours on the phone and driving long distances to get their kids swabbed.\n\nSarah Kliff, an investigative reporter at The Times, started looking into the issue after an outbreak at her son\u2019s day care center. \u201cI just assumed, because I live in a large city with a lot of testing sites, that it would be easy,\u201d she said.\n\nWorking with our colleague Margot Sanger-Katz, and with help from the readers of this newsletter, Sarah found shortfalls across the country.\n\nIn Florida, the division of emergency management announced last month that it would \u201cprioritize\u201d pediatric testing as students there began to return to in-person school. Still, only a quarter of the 60 testing sites the agency supports will see children of all ages. The state\u2019s 18 drive-through sites are limited to patients 5 and older.\n\nSome cities, like Los Angeles, offer public testing to anyone. But others, like San Francisco and Dallas, have age cutoffs. In part, that\u2019s because of differences in health insurance and concerns about medical privacy. The challenge of administering an invasive test to squirming children also plays a role. \u201cKids weren\u2019t really out in the wider world when this whole testing infrastructure was set up,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cBut now they are. Day cares are reopening. Some students are going to school in person. We don\u2019t really have a testing infrastructure meant to handle that.\u201d\n\nLimited pediatric testing might stall a return to normalcy. Without reliable testing, schools and day care centers cannot quickly isolate and trace the virus following an outbreak.\n\nMargot and Sarah also wanted to thank everyone who wrote in to our call-out last week. Their story would not have been possible without your thoughtful, candid reflections.\n\nK-12 Updates\nIn the U.S.\nIn Iowa, leaders of the Des Moines Public Schools district are trying to figure out what to do now that a judge has denied their request to hold all classes remotely.\n\nBars in Ada County, Idaho, are allowed to reopen only after officials determined that school districts are at a lower risk than before.\n\nAt least 10 New York City public school buildings need repairs to their ventilation systems, and may have to delay the start of school past Sept. 21.\n\nA shortage of substitute teachers in New Jersey could delay the start of schools for some districts.\n\nAcross the country, parents and educators have raised privacy concerns about coronavirus dashboards. In Florida, where the State Department of Health has pushed for confidentiality, some districts are releasing information anyway in the name of transparency.\n\nOutside Detroit, one school has moved entirely outside, relying on nature to shape coursework and keep students safe. Other Michigan schools are doing the same.\n\nIn Colorado, a 12-year-old Black boy was suspended for having a toy gun in a virtual class, and the principal called the police.\n\nAround the world\nIn Spain, one of the hardest-hit countries in Europe, parents are revolting against the return to in-person classes.\n\nA week after children began returning to classrooms, a number of schools across England and Wales temporarily closed because of outbreaks.\n\nIn Iran, schools have reopened amid concerns from parents. \u201cHis health is a priority over education,\u201d one parent told Al Jazeera. \u201cThey\u2019re kids. They touch everything. And then they touch their faces.\u201d\n\nTeachers: How are you encouraging curiosity?\nIn a Times Op-Ed, Adam Grant and Allison Sweet Grant, a contributing writer and a psychiatric nurse practitioner, suggest that curiosity is one of most important things for learners right now.\n\nTeachers: Tell us your strategies for keeping kids curious, especially in virtual or hybrid learning. We may feature some in an upcoming newsletter, or in a future special section of the paper. Thanks!",

            "HeadLine": "Vaping Links to Covid Risk Are Becoming Clear",
            "Text": "Twenty-year-old Janan Moein vaped his first pen a year ago. By late fall, he was blowing through several THC-laced cartridges a week \u2014 more, he said, than most people can handle.\n\nThen in early December, he found himself in the emergency room of Sharp Grossmont Hospital in San Diego with a collapsed lung and a diagnosis of vaping-related lung illness. His hospital stay plunged him into a medically induced coma, forced him onto a breathing machine and stripped nearly 50 pounds off his 6-foot-1-inch frame in just two weeks.\n\nAt one point, Mr. Moein said, his doctors gave him a 5 percent chance of survival. He resolved that the wax pen he had vaped before his hospitalization would be his last.\n\nWhen he contracted a mild case of Covid-19 during a family barbecue three months ago, he knew he had quit not a moment too soon. \u201cIf I had caught Covid-19 within the week before I got really ill, I probably would have died,\u201d he said.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, experts have warned that the coronavirus \u2014 a respiratory pathogen \u2014 most likely capitalizes on the scarred lungs of smokers and vapers. Doctors and researchers are now starting to pinpoint the ways in which smoking and vaping seem to enhance the virus\u2019s ability to spread from person to person, infiltrate the lungs and spark some of Covid-19\u2019s worst symptoms.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt in saying that smoking and vaping could put people at increased risk of poor outcomes from Covid-19,\u201d said Dr. Stephanie Lovinsky-Desir, a pediatric pulmonologist at Columbia University. \u201cIt is quite clear that smoking and vaping are bad for the lungs, and the predominant symptoms of Covid are respiratory. Those two things are going to be bad in combination.\u201d Last year\u2019s vaping crisis, during which thousands of people like Mr. Moein were sickened and hospitalized with severe lung and respiratory illnesses, underscored the hazards of many e-cigarette and vaping products, especially illicitly sold marijuana-based vapes. But while several studies have found that smoking can more than double a person\u2019s risk of severe Covid-19 symptoms, the data on the relationship between vaping and Covid-19 are only beginning to emerge. A team of researchers recently reported that young adults who vape are five times more likely to receive a coronavirus diagnosis.\n\nMuch of what underlies the relationship between smoking, vaping and the coronavirus remains unclear. Doctors aren\u2019t sure why vaping makes some people seriously sick, but seems to spare others. And Mr. Moein\u2019s unexpectedly mild encounter with the coronavirus remains mysterious as well.\n\nThese and other lingering questions have made the risks of smoking and vaping during the pandemic tough to communicate. James Ippolito, a 26-year-old Army veteran who lives in Hingham, Mass., has been hooked on vaping nicotine for about six years. \u201cI vape every day, all day long,\u201d Mr. Ippolito said.\n\nThe looming threat of the virus doesn\u2019t intimidate him. \u201cI hate to say it, but if I got the virus, I would still be vaping \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t even think it was related,\u201d he said.\n\nSuch stubbornness troubles experts, who pointed out that Covid is hardly the first disease to hit smokers and vapers harder.\n\n\u201cLungs aren\u2019t designed to regularly breathe in smoke and vape,\u201d said Dr. Drew Harris, a pulmonologist at UVA Health in Virginia. These products, he added, \u201cdo just about everything bad you can think of.\u201d\n\nAbout 34 million adults smoke cigarettes in the United States, many of them from communities of color and low socioeconomic status \u2014 groups already known to be more vulnerable to the virus. And more than 5 million middle and high school students recently reported using vapes.\n\nThe active contents of cigarettes and vapes vary immensely, ranging from nicotine to THC, the high-inducing ingredient in marijuana. But many experts are more concerned about the other ingredients that tend to accompany them: additives like heavy metals and vitamin E acetate, which bathe the lung in toxins and ultrafine particles that can poison or pulverize delicate tissues.\n\nDecades of research have unmasked smoking\u2019s ability to put the immune system on the fritz. The punch of harmful chemicals packed into each puff is thought to discombobulate the system of checks and balances needed to direct disease-fighting cells and molecules toward harmful invaders like germs, while waylaying any misguided attacks on healthy tissues.\n\nA body hamstrung by a smoking habit can struggle to rouse a sufficient defense against viruses \u2014 but has little trouble turning its arsenal of weapons inward. Eventually, deteriorating lungs can become chronically inflamed and awash with mucus, narrowing the airways and stymieing the flow of oxygen into the blood. Certain patients may end up with lungs pockmarked by scar tissue, further impeding the movement of air.\n\nDr. Lovinsky-Desir describes the internal architecture of these tissues as bunches of gas-filled grapes, enmeshed in a network of blood vessels. \u201cChronic smoking destroys those grapes,\u201d she said. \u201cThey become saggy and floppy.\u201d\n\nSmoke can also compromise little hairlike structures known as cilia that boot toxins and microbes out of the airways, making it easier for pathogens to set up shop in the lungs.\n\n\nShould a virus then enter the mix, Dr. Lovinsky-Desir said, \u201cit will cause more destruction,\u201d clogging the already damaged grapes with a glut of cellular debris. Years of data have borne out these relationships. Smokers who catch the flu, for instance, are more likely than nonsmokers to wind up in the hospital.\n\nLess is known about vaping, a relative newcomer. But similar trends have been noted for e-cigarettes and vape pens. Several studies have shown that vaping makes mice more vulnerable to bacteria and viruses, and sends surges of inflammation throughout the body, beyond the boundaries of the lungs.\n\nMr. Moein was one of thousands who last year fell prey to a disease called e-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury, or Evali. Many Evali patients had vaped products containing a sticky substance called vitamin E acetate, which has been found in the branded Dr. Zodiak cartridges Mr. Moein preferred. Mr. Moein still recalls his hospital stay in vivid detail.\n\n\u201cMy lips were blue,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had to tape my eyes shut. I was hallucinating the entire time that the nurses were trying to kill me, that the walls were made of human skin. It was a really bad situation.\u201d\n\nNearly a year later, Mr. Moein, a towering athlete who played competitive sports in high school, said he was now once again \u201cvery healthy.\u201d\n\nBut Dr. Laura Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist and vaping expert at University of California San Diego and one of Mr. Moein\u2019s doctors, said experts were still teasing apart the potential long-term effects of vaping, even brushes briefer than his.\n\n\u201cJust because he feels 100 percent recovered doesn\u2019t mean his lung function returned to 100 percent,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter peaking last September, emergency department visits linked to Evali plummeted. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not updated their counts since February, leaving experts worried that concerns over vaping have fallen to the wayside. \u201cThis has not gone away from patients,\u201d said Michelle Eakin, a pulmonary disease expert at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nDr. Crotty Alexander noted that she and other researchers have struggled to follow up on many of last year\u2019s Evali cases, paradoxically thanks to a pandemic that might hit some of these patients especially hard.\n\nEarly evidence hints that the virus may have an easier time breaking into the bodies of smokers and vapers. Smoking appears to alter the surfaces of certain cells, prompting them to coat themselves with more of a molecule called ACE-2 \u2014 the protein the coronavirus uses to break into its targets.\n\n\u201cIf you have higher expression, you\u2019re going to have more virus entering cells,\u201d Dr. Crotty Alexander said. \u201cI\u2019m now seeing the same sort of data come out on the vaping side.\u201d\n\nThat pattern, layered on top of the ways in which vaping weakens the lungs, may help explain why a recent survey of more than 4,000 people ages 13 to 24 found that vaping was strongly linked to catching the coronavirus. But Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, a pediatrics researcher at Stanford University and an author on the study, said that there was probably more than biology at play.\n\nPeople who vape often do it socially, sharing spaces and equipment. And vaping, like smoking, involves a lot of hand-to-mouth movement, providing germs an easy path into the airway, Dr. Eakin said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re smoking or vaping,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019re not wearing a mask.\u201d Still unclear are the long-term consequences of Covid\u2019s effects on those who smoked or vaped. Accumulating evidence suggests that the coronavirus can wreak havoc on blood vessels, seeding clots that suffocate and warp tissues, including the lungs \u2014 most likely making any smoking or vaping after Covid even more dangerous than before.\n\n\u201cSome of these patients will have permanent issues,\u201d said Dr. Anne Melzer, a pulmonologist at the University of Minnesota.\n\nArlie Frahmann, a longtime smoker who picked up her first cigarette at the age of 9, hesitated to give up cigarettes when the coronavirus first infiltrated her community in Damariscotta, Maine, this spring. \u201cThe last thing I wanted was to be stressed out during quarantine,\u201d she said.\n\nAs of this week, though, Ms. Frahmann is eager to quit. She started a new job at a bakery, where she will have to interact with strangers.\n\n\u201cIt was one thing to explain it away to myself when I wasn\u2019t going into public at all,\u201d she said of her smoking. \u201cBut now I can\u2019t justify it.\u201d\n\nA few early reports suggest that some people may be shelving their cigarettes or vapes. As schools reopen for in-person learning, though, it might become easy to relapse.\n\nAnd Dr. Lovinsky-Desir worries that the stressors brought on by the pandemic may be pushing some people to smoke or vape even more.\n\nMr. Moein recalls brushing off warnings from his father, who used to send him articles about the dangers of vaping. \u201cI used to tell him, \u2018You\u2019re out of touch, vaping is safer,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAt one point, I was getting so many articles that I blocked his number.\u201d\n\nBut last year\u2019s events flipped Mr. Moein\u2019s worldview. The pandemic, he said, is another reminder that the risks of vaping simply aren\u2019t worth it: \u201cThere\u2019s no way in hell that vaping helps Covid-19.\u201d",

            "HeadLine": "Even Big Pharma Is Turning on Trump",
            "Text": "President Trump has become so shameless about subverting the public interest to his political self-interest that Big Pharma \u2014 not generally regarded as the most civic-minded of entities \u2014 is now scrambling to control the damage.\n\nOn Tuesday, nine drug companies issued a joint pledge that when it came to releasing a vaccine for the coronavirus, they would \u201cstand with science\u201d and \u201cmake the safety and well-being of vaccinated individuals our top priority.\u201d They vowed to follow the guidance of the appropriate regulators and to make decisions based on \u201clarge, high quality clinical studies,\u201d as is standard protocol.\n\n\u201cWe believe this pledge will help ensure public confidence in the rigorous scientific and regulatory process by which Covid-19 vaccines are evaluated and may ultimately be approved,\u201d the companies said.\n\nAs P.R. strategies go, it may seem odd for drugmakers to offer unsolicited assurances that they will not cut corners on safety. This feels a little bit like a server at Olive Garden greeting customers with a promise not to spit in their iced tea. Why even raise the possibility?\n\nSuch is the extent to which Mr. Trump has politicized and undermined public faith in everything \u2014 especially his own administration.\n\nHaving badly mishandled the pandemic and seen his job approval numbers suffer, Mr. Trump has been pressuring the Food and Drug Administration to crunch the vaccine timeline. He has even accused \u201cthe deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA\u201d of slow-walking the process expressly to undermine his re-election bid. The agency\u2019s commissioner, Stephen Hahn, has not exactly inspired confidence in his ability to withstand the presidential heat. During a White House appearance with Mr. Trump last month, Dr. Hahn grossly exaggerated the effectiveness of a Covid-19 treatment using convalescent plasma. The scientific community dogpiled on the commissioner, prompting him to issue an extended mea culpa on Twitter.\n\nWith increasing frequency and vigor, the president has been tantalizing voters with the promise of a vaccine becoming available before Election Day. In his speech at the Republican convention, he boasted that \u201cwe will have a safe and effective vaccine this year.\u201d That same day, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified state and local health officials to prepare to distribute a vaccine to high-risk groups by late October or early November.\n\nSince then, the president has repeatedly spoken of a vaccine as if it were some marvelous October Surprise. At a news briefing on Monday, he teased reporters: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a vaccine very soon. Maybe even before a very special date. You know what date I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\n\nEditors\u2019 Picks\n\nA Man, a Pint and a Timer Become Symbols of Ireland\u2019s Pandemic Rules\n\nJane Fonda, Intergalactic Eco-Warrior in a Red Coat\n\n\u2018Dwarf Pride\u2019 Was Hard Won. Will a Growth Drug Undermine It?\nContinue reading the main story\nHealth experts with actual scientific knowledge \u2014 including key administration officials involved in the development process \u2014 have suggested that this timeline is overly optimistic.\n\nThe politicization of the issue has unsettled voters. In a recent survey by the Harris Poll and STAT News, 78 percent of respondents \u2014 72 percent of Republicans and 82 percent of Democrats \u2014 expressed concern that the vaccine approval process was \u201cbeing driven more by politics than science.\u201d Eighty-three percent said that if a vaccine were approved quickly, they would worry about its safety.\n\nTo be fair, Mr. Trump did not single-handedly destroy the public\u2019s confidence in government regulators. Government-bashing has been a Republican staple for decades, with special enmity reserved for regulatory agencies, which, in the view of many conservatives, serve only to pervert the beauty and rationality of the market. As with so many of his party\u2019s longstanding lines of attack, Mr. Trump has distilled the disdain for government expertise and oversight to its toxic essence.\n\nOn one level, it\u2019s befuddling to see drug companies pitching themselves as guardians of the public good. Big Pharma has a well-earned reputation as being synonymous with Big Greed. Practically speaking, the new joint statement doesn\u2019t do all that much. It is, for instance, somewhat vague about precisely what requirements the companies would meet before seeking emergency authorization.\n\nBut from a messaging standpoint, the pledge is illuminating. Even the most avaricious drug executives recognize that absent a baseline of public confidence in their products, the companies\u2019 bottom lines will suffer. Mr. Trump is destroying that baseline.\n\nVaccine safety was already a sensitive subject. Anti-vaxxers stand ready to spread fear and conspiracy theories without any political provocation. (The \u201cPlandemic\u201d conspiracy that exploded on social media, which claims the coronavirus is the handiwork of a sinister band of elites, features a big dose of anti-vax nuttiness.) The last thing drug companies want is for the president to fuel fears about the integrity of a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nLast weekend, Kamala Harris, Joe Biden\u2019s newly minted running mate, voiced hesitation about receiving any vaccine that might emerge before Election Day. \u201cI would not trust Donald Trump, and it would have to be a credible source of information that talks about the efficacy and the reliability of whatever he\u2019s talking about,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cI will not take his word for it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to fault Ms. Harris when just this week, excerpts from Bob Woodward\u2019s new book, \u201cRage,\u201d reveal that the president knew back in February that the coronavirus was \u201cdeadly stuff\u201d but intentionally misled the public. \u201cI wanted to always play it down,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nWhen the president cannot serve as a credible source on matters of life and death, whom can the nation turn to? Drug executives clearly aren\u2019t the only ones fretting over that question.",

            "Text": "The joint statement by competitors was seen as an effort to restore public trust as President Trump has pushed for a vaccine before the presidential election. Nine pharmaceutical companies issued a joint pledge on Tuesday that they would \u201cstand with science\u201d and not put forward a vaccine until it had been thoroughly vetted for safety and efficacy.\n\nThe companies did not rule out seeking an emergency authorization of their vaccines, but promised that any potential coronavirus vaccine would be decided based on \u201clarge, high quality clinical trials\u201d and that the companies would follow guidance from regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\u201cWe believe this pledge will help ensure public confidence in the rigorous scientific and regulatory process by which Covid-19 vaccines are evaluated and may ultimately be approved,\u201d the companies said.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly claimed in recent weeks that a vaccine could be available before Election Day \u2014 Nov. 3 \u2014 heightening fears that his administration is politicizing the race to develop a vaccine and potentially undermining public trust in any vaccine approved.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have the vaccine soon, maybe before a special date,\u201d the president said on Monday. \u201cYou know what date I\u2019m talking about.\u201d The move was welcomed by some researchers who said that the statement could increase public confidence in a coronavirus vaccine at a time when skepticism was running high. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely a desperate need for this vaccine,\u201d said Dr. Judith Feinberg, the vice chairwoman for research in medicine at West Virginia University in Morgantown. \u201cI love the fact that the nine big vaccine manufacturers today said they would not do anything premature \u2014 I think there\u2019s enormous pressure to do something premature.\u201d Three of the companies that signed the pledge are testing their candidate vaccines in late-stage clinical trials in the United States: Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca.\n\nPfizer has said repeatedly over the past week that it could apply to the F.D.A. for emergency approval as early as October. On Tuesday, its chief executive, Dr. Albert Bourla, predicted in an interview on the \u201cToday\u201d show on NBC that the company would have an answer about whether its vaccine worked by the end of October, but acknowledged that did not mean its vaccine would be available to the public by then.\n\nModerna and AstraZeneca have been less specific, saying only they hope to have a vaccine by the end of the year. Last week, Moderna\u2019s chief executive said the company was slightly slowing its enrollment in order to include more people from groups that had been most affected by Covid-19.\n\nEditors\u2019 Picks\n\nA Man, a Pint and a Timer Become Symbols of Ireland\u2019s Pandemic Rules\n\nJane Fonda, Intergalactic Eco-Warrior in a Red Coat\n\n\u2018Dwarf Pride\u2019 Was Hard Won. Will a Growth Drug Undermine It?\nContinue reading the main story\nPfizer and Moderna are each close to fully enrolling the 30,000 participants in each of their trials, with some analysts predicting they will be finished within the next two weeks. AstraZeneca is further behind in its U.S. trials, having begun enrollment on Aug. 31. Federal officials have been pushing back against Mr. Trump\u2019s enthusiastic predictions. Late last week, Moncef Slaoui, the top scientist on Operation Warp Speed, the federal effort to quickly bring a vaccine to market, warned in an interview with National Public Radio that the chance of successful vaccine results by October was \u201cvery, very low.\u201d\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said he believed that researchers would know whether the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were effective by \u201cNovember or December.\u201d\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Dr. Slaoui said the goal of Operation Warp Speed was \u201cto ensure that no technical, logistic or financial hurdles hinder vaccine development or deployment without curtailing the critical steps required by sound science and regulatory standards.\u201d He added that the pledge \u201creiterates the position of Operation Warp Speed, that this project is driven by science and that any vaccine must meet the gold standard of the Food and Drug Administration.\u201d\n\nDrug companies have had to carefully navigate the political landscape. A successful vaccine could help restore the industry\u2019s battered image and offer an end to the pandemic. But rushing a vaccine to market that winds up causing serious side effects \u2014 or simply does not work \u2014 could do catastrophic damage to their reputations.\n\nIn the nine companies\u2019 statement on Tuesday, they did not mention Mr. Trump, saying only that they have \u201ca united commitment to uphold the integrity of the scientific process.\u201d\n\nThe other six companies that signed the pledge were BioNTech, which is developing the vaccine in partnership with Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Novavax and Sanofi.",

            "Text": "Key findings are summarized here.\nConcentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA measured in upper respiratory specimens decline after onset of symptoms (CDC, unpublished data, 2020; Midgley et al., 2020; Young et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2020; W\u00f6lfel et al., 2020; van Kampen et al., 2020).\nThe likelihood of recovering replication-competent virus also declines after onset of symptoms. For patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, replication-competent virus has not been recovered after 10 days following symptom onset (CDC, unpublished data, 2020; W\u00f6lfel et al., 2020; Arons et al., 2020; Bullard et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; personal communication with Young et al., 2020; Korea CDC, 2020). Recovery of replication-competent virus between 10 and 20 days after symptom onset has been documented in some persons with severe COVID-19 that, in some cases, was complicated by immunocompromised state (van Kampen et al., 2020). However, in this series of patients, it was estimated that 88% and 95% of their specimens no longer yielded replication-competent virus after 10 and 15 days, respectively, following symptom onset.\nA large contact tracing study demonstrated that high-risk household and hospital contacts did not develop infection if their exposure to a case patient started 6 days or more after the case patient\u2019s illness onset (Cheng et al., 2020).\nAlthough replication-competent virus was not isolated 3 weeks after symptom onset, recovered patients can continue to have SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in their upper respiratory specimens for up to 12 weeks (Korea CDC, 2020; Li et al., 2020; Xiao et al, 2020). Investigation of 285 \u201cpersistently positive\u201d persons, which included 126 persons who had developed recurrent symptoms, found no secondary infections among 790 contacts attributable to contact with these case patients. Efforts to isolate replication-competent virus from 108 of these case patients were unsuccessful (Korea CDC, 2020).\nSpecimens from patients who recovered from an initial COVID-19 illness and subsequently developed new symptoms and retested positive by RT-PCR did not have replication-competent virus detected (Korea CDC, 2020; Lu et al., 2020). The risk of reinfection may be lower in the first 3 months after initial infection, based on limited evidence from another betacoronavirus (HCoV-OC43), the genus to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs (Kiyuka et al, 2018).\nCurrently, 6 months after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, there have been no confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. However, the number of areas where sustained infection pressure has been maintained, and therefore reinfections would be most likely observed, remains limited.\nSerologic or other correlates of immunity have not yet been established.\nThe current evidence includes the following caveats:\n\nIn a recent study of skilled nursing facility workers followed prospectively for asymptomatic infection, one of 48 infected staff had a nasopharyngeal swab which was weakly positive on a single-passage plaque assay more than 20 days after initial diagnosis; however, the specimen was not subjected to serial passage to demonstrate the presence of replication-competent virus (Quicke et al., 2020).\nIn one case report, a person with mild illness provided specimens that yielded replication-competent virus for up to 18 days after symptom onset (Liu et al., 2020).\nData currently available are derived from adults; equivalent data from children and infants are not presently available.\nMore data are needed concerning viral shedding in some situations, including in immunocompromised persons.\nAssessment\nAvailable data indicate that persons with mild to moderate COVID-19 remain infectious no longer than 10 days after symptom onset. Persons with more severe to critical illness or severe immunocompromise likely remain infectious no longer than 20 days after symptom onset.  Recovered persons can continue to shed detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory specimens for up to 3 months after illness onset, albeit at concentrations considerably lower than during illness, in ranges where replication-competent virus has not been reliably recovered and infectiousness is unlikely. The etiology of this persistently detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA has yet to be determined. Studies have not found evidence that clinically recovered persons with persistence of viral RNA have transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to others. These findings strengthen the justification for relying on a symptom based, rather than test-based strategy for ending isolation of these patients, so that persons who are by current evidence no longer infectious are not kept unnecessarily isolated and excluded from work or other responsibilities.\n\nReinfection with SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been definitively confirmed in any recovered persons to date. If, and if so when, persons can be reinfected with SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown and is a subject of investigation. Persons infected with related endemic human betacoronavirus appear to become susceptible again at around 90 days after onset of  infection. Thus, for persons recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, a positive PCR during the 90 days after illness onset more likely represents persistent shedding of viral RNA than reinfection.\n\nIf such a person remains asymptomatic during this 90-day period, then any re-testing is unlikely to yield useful information, even if the person had close contact with an infected person.\nIf such a person becomes symptomatic during this 90-day period and an evaluation fails to identify a diagnosis other than SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g., influenza), then the person may warrant evaluation for SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in consultation with an infectious disease or infection control expert. Isolation may be warranted during this evaluation, particularly if symptoms developed after close contact with an infected person.\nCorrelates of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been established. Specifically, the utility of serologic testing to establish the absence or presence of infection or reinfection remains undefined.\n\nThe recommendations below are based on the best information available in mid-July 2020 and reflect the realities of an evolving pandemic. Even for pathogens for which many years of data are available, it may not be possible to establish recommendations that ensure 100% of persons who are shedding replication-competent virus remain isolated. CDC will continue to closely monitor the evolving science for information that would warrant reconsideration of these recommendations.\n\nRecommendations\nDuration of isolation and precautions\nFor most persons with COVID-19 illness, isolation and precautions can generally be discontinued 10 days after symptom onset1 and resolution of fever for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing medications, and with improvement of other symptoms.\nA limited number of persons with severe illness may produce replication-competent virus beyond 10 days that may warrant extending duration of isolation and precautions for up to 20 days after symptom onset; consider consultation with infection control experts.\nFor persons who never develop symptoms, isolation and other precautions can be discontinued 10 days after the date of their first positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.\nRole of PCR testing2 to discontinue isolation or precautions\nFor persons who are severely immunocompromised, a test-based strategy could be considered in consultation with infectious diseases experts.\nFor all others, a test-based strategy is no longer recommended except to discontinue isolation or precautions earlier than would occur under the strategy outlined in Part 1, above.\nRole of PCR testing2 after discontinuation of isolation or precautions\nFor persons previously diagnosed with symptomatic COVID-19 who remain asymptomatic after recovery, retesting is not recommended within 3 months after the date of symptom onset for the initial COVID-19 infection.\nFor persons who develop new symptoms consistent with COVID-19 during the 3 months after the date of initial symptom onset, if an alternative etiology cannot be identified by a provider, then the person may warrant retesting; consultation with infectious disease or infection control experts is recommended. Isolation may be considered during this evaluation based on consultation with an infection control expert, especially in the event symptoms develop within 14 days after close contact with an infected person.\nFor persons who never developed symptoms, the date of first positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA should be used in place of the date of symptom onset.\nRole of serologic testing\nSerologic testing should not be used to establish the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or reinfection.",

            "Text": "Background\nThere is much to learn about the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Based on what is currently known about the virus and about similar coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS, spread from person-to-person happens most frequently among close contacts (within about 6 feet). This type of transmission occurs via respiratory droplets, but disease transmission via infectious aerosols is currently uncertain. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to persons from surfaces contaminated with the virus has not been documented. Transmission of coronavirus occurs much more commonly through respiratory droplets than through objects and surfaces, like doorknobs, countertops, keyboards, toys, etc. Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in community settings.\n\nIt is unknown how long the air inside a room occupied by someone with confirmed COVID-19 remains potentially infectious. Facilities will need to consider factors such as the size of the room and the ventilation system design (including flowrate [air changes per hour] and location of supply and exhaust vents) when deciding how long to close off rooms or areas used by ill persons before beginning disinfection. Taking measures to improve ventilation in an area or room where someone was ill or suspected to be ill with COVID-19 will help shorten the time it takes respiratory droplets to be removed from the air. Purpose\nThis guidance provides recommendations on the cleaning and disinfection of rooms or areas occupied by those with suspected or with confirmed COVID-19. It is aimed at limiting the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in key environments. These recommendations will be updated if additional information becomes available.\n\nThese guidelines are focused on community, non-healthcare facilities such as schools, institutions of higher education, offices, daycare centers, businesses, and community centers that do, and do not, house persons overnight. These guidelines are not meant  for cleaning staff in healthcare facilities or repatriation sites, households, or for others for whom specific guidance already exists.\n\nDefinitions\nCommunity facilities such as schools, daycare centers, and businesses comprise most non-healthcare settings that are visited by the general public outside of a household.\nCleaning refers to the removal of dirt and impurities, including germs, from surfaces. Cleaning alone does not kill germs. But by removing the germs, it decreases their number and therefore any risk of spreading infection.\nDisinfecting works by using chemicals, for example EPA-registered disinfectants, to kill germs on surfaces. This process does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs. But killing germs remaining on a surface after cleaning further reduces any risk of spreading infection.\nCleaning and Disinfection After Persons Suspected/Confirmed to Have COVID-19 Have Been in the Facility\nTiming and location of cleaning and disinfection of surfaces\n\nAt a school, daycare center, office, or other facility that does not house people overnight:\n Close off areas visited by the ill persons. Open outside doors and windows and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. Wait 24 hours or as long as practical before beginning cleaning and disinfection.\nCleaning staff should clean and disinfect all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment (like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines) used by the ill persons, focusing especially on frequently touched surfaces.\nAt a facility that does house people overnight:\nFollow Interim Guidance for US Institutions of Higher Education on working with state and local health officials to isolate ill persons and provide temporary housing as needed.\nClose off areas visited by the ill persons. Open outside doors and windows and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. Wait 24 hours or as long as practical before beginning cleaning and disinfection.\nIn areas where ill persons are being housed in isolation, follow Interim Guidance for Environmental Cleaning and Disinfection for U.S. Households with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019. This includes focusing on cleaning and disinfecting common areas where staff/others providing services may come into contact with ill persons but reducing cleaning and disinfection of bedrooms/bathrooms used by ill persons to as-needed.\nIn areas where ill persons have visited or used, continue routine cleaning and disinfection as in this guidance.\nIf it has been more than 7 days since the person with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 visited or used the facility, additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary.\nHow to Clean and Disinfect\nHard (non-porous) surfaces\n\nWear disposable gloves when cleaning and disinfecting surfaces. Gloves should be discarded after each cleaning. If reusable gloves are used, those gloves should be dedicated for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces for COVID-19 and should not be used for other purposes. Consult the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for cleaning and disinfection products used. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed.\nIf surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.\nAlways read and follow the directions on the label to ensure safe and effective use.\n\nWear skin protection and consider eye protection for potential splash hazards\nEnsure adequate ventilation\nUse no more than the amount recommended on the label\nUse water at room temperature for dilution (unless stated otherwise on the label)\nAvoid mixing chemical products\nLabel diluted cleaning solutions\nStore and use chemicals out of the reach of children and pets\nYou should never eat, drink, breathe or inject these products into your body or apply directly to your skin as they can cause serious harm. Do not wipe or bathe pets with these products or any other products that are not approved for animal use.\n\nSee EPA\u2019s 6 steps for Safe and Effective Disinfectant Useexternal icon.\n\nSpecial considerations should be made for people with asthma and they should not be present when cleaning and disinfecting is happening as this can trigger asthma exacerbations. Learn more about reducing asthma triggers.\n\nDisinfect with a household disinfectant on List N: Disinfectants for use against SARs-CoV-2external icon, the virus that causes COVID 19. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. Read the product label for the correct concentration to use, application method, and contact time.\nDiluted household bleach solutions can be used if appropriate for the surface. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted:\nUse bleach containing 5.25%\u20138.25% sodium hypochlorite. Do not use a bleach product if the percentage is not in this range or is not specified.\nFollow the manufacturer\u2019s application instructions for the surface, ensuring a contact time of at least 1 minute.\nEnsure proper ventilation during and after application.\nCheck to ensure the product is not past its expiration date.\nNever mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. This can cause fumes that may be very dangerous to breathe in.\nPrepare a bleach solution by mixing:\n5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) of 5.25%\u20138.25% bleach per gallon of room temperature water or\n4 teaspoons of 5.25%\u20138.25% bleach per quart of room temperature water\nBleach solutions will be effective for disinfection up to 24 hours.\nAlcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol may also be used.\nCleaning staff and others should clean hands often, including immediately after removing gloves and after contact with an ill person, by washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water.\nAlways read and follow the directions on the label to ensure safe and effective use.\n\nKeep hand sanitizers away from fire or flame\nFor children under six years of age, hand sanitizer should be used with adult supervision\nAlways store hand sanitizer out of reach of children and pets\nSee FDA\u2019s Tips for Safe Sanitizer Useexternal iconexternal icon and CDC's Hand Sanitizer Use Considerations\n\nFollow normal preventive actions while at work and home, including cleaning hands and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.\nAdditional key times to clean hands include:\nAfter blowing one\u2019s nose, coughing, or sneezing.\nAfter using the restroom.\nBefore eating or preparing food.\nAfter contact with animals or pets.\nBefore and after providing routine care for another person who needs assistance such as a child.\nSoft (porous) surfaces\n\nFor soft (porous) surfaces such as carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes, remove visible contamination if present and clean with appropriate cleaners indicated for use on these surfaces. After cleaning:\nIf the items can be laundered, launder items in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and then dry items completely.\nOtherwise, use products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19external icon and that are suitable for porous surfaces\nElectronics\n\nFor electronics such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines, remove visible contamination if present.\nFollow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products.\nConsider use of wipeable covers for electronics.\nIf no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or sprays containing at least 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids.\nL\u200binens, clothing, and other items that go in the laundry\u200b\n\nIn order to minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air, do not shake dirty laundry.\nWash items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. Dirty laundry that has been in contact with an ill person can be washed with other people\u2019s items.\nClean and disinfect hampers or other carts for transporting laundry according to guidance above for hard or soft surfaces.\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE) and Hand Hygiene\nThe risk of exposure to cleaning staff is inherently low. Cleaning staff should wear disposable gloves and gowns for all tasks in the cleaning process, including handling trash.\nGloves and gowns should be compatible with the disinfectant products being used.\nAdditional PPE might be required based on the cleaning/disinfectant products being used and whether there is a risk of splash.\nGloves and gowns should be removed carefully to avoid contamination of the wearer and the surrounding area. Be sure to clean hands after removing gloves.\nIf gowns are not available, coveralls, aprons or work uniforms can be worn during cleaning and disinfecting. Reusable (washable) clothing should be laundered afterwards. Clean hands after handling dirty laundry.\nGloves should be removed after cleaning a room or area occupied by ill persons. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed.\nCleaning staff should immediately report breaches in PPE such as a tear in gloves or any other potential exposures to their supervisor.\nCleaning staff and others should clean hands often, including immediately after removing gloves and after contact with an ill person, by washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water.\nFollow normal preventive actions while at work and home, including cleaning hands and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.\nAdditional key times to clean hands include:\nAfter blowing one\u2019s nose, coughing, or sneezing.\nAfter using the restroom.\nBefore eating or preparing food.\nAfter contact with animals or pets.\nBefore and after providing routine care for another person who needs assistance such as a child.",

            "Text": "Clinical Presentation\nIncubation period\nThe incubation period for COVID-19 is thought to extend to 14 days, with a median time of 4-5 days from exposure to symptoms onset.1-3 One study reported that 97.5% of persons with COVID-19 who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection.3\n\nPresentation\nThe signs and symptoms of COVID-19 present at illness onset vary, but over the course of the disease, most persons with COVID-19 will experience the following1,4-9:\n\nFever or chills\nCough\nShortness of breath or difficulty breathing\nFatigue\nMuscle or body aches\nHeadache\nNew loss of taste or smell\nSore throat\nCongestion or runny nose\nNausea or vomiting\nDiarrhea\nSymptoms differ with severity of disease.  For example, fever, cough, and shortness of breath are more commonly reported among people who are hospitalized with COVID-19 than among those with milder disease (non-hospitalized patients). Atypical presentations occur often, and older adults and persons with medical comorbidities may have delayed presentation of fever and respiratory symptoms.10,14 In one study of 1,099 hospitalized patients, fever was present in only 44% at hospital admission but eventually developed in 89% during hospitalization.1 Fatigue, headache, and muscle aches (myalgia) are among the most commonly reported symptoms in people who are not hospitalized, and sore throat and nasal congestion or runny nose (rhinorrhea) also may be prominent symptoms.  Many people with COVID-19  experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, sometimes prior to developing fever and lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms.9 Loss of smell (anosmia) or taste (ageusia) preceding the onset of respiratory symptoms has been commonly reported in COVID-19 especially among women and young or middle-aged patients who do not require hospitalization.11,12 While many of the symptoms of COVID-19 are common to other respiratory or viral illnesses, anosmia appears to be more specific to COVID-19.12\n\nSeveral studies have reported that the signs Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in children are similar to adults vary by age of the child,  and are usually milder compared to adults.15-19 For more information on the clinical presentation and course among children, see Information for Pediatric Healthcare Providers.\n\nAsymptomatic and Pre-Symptomatic Infection\nSeveral studies have documented SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) and in patients not yet symptomatic (pre-symptomatic).16,18,20-30 Since asymptomatic persons are not routinely tested, the prevalence of asymptomatic infection and detection of pre-symptomatic infection is not yet well understood. One study found that as many as 13% of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children were asymptomatic.16 Another study of skilled nursing facility residents who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 after contact with a healthcare worker with COVID-19 demonstrated that half of the residents were asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic at the time of contact tracing, evaluation, and testing.27 Patients may have abnormalities on chest imaging before the onset of symptoms.21,22.\n\nAsymptomatic and Pre-Symptomatic Transmission\nIncreasing numbers of epidemiologic studies have documented SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the pre-symptomatic incubation period,21,31-33. Virologic studies using RT-PCR detection have reported tests with  low cycle thresholds, indicating larger quantities of viral RNA and viable virus has been cultured from persons with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.25,27,30,34 The relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA shedding and  transmission risk is not yet clear. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission due to asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infection compared to symptomatic infection is unclear.35\n\nClinical Course\nIllness Severity\nThe largest cohort reported of >44,000 persons with COVID-19 from China showed that illness severity can range from mild to critical:36\n\nMild to moderate (mild symptoms up to mild pneumonia): 81%\nSevere (dyspnea, hypoxia, or >50% lung involvement on imaging): 14%\nCritical (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan system dysfunction): 5%\nIn this study, all deaths occurred among patients with critical illness, and the overall case fatality rate was 2.3%.36 The case fatality rate among patients with critical disease was 49%.36 Among children in China, illness severity was lower with 94% having asymptomatic, mild, or moderate disease; 5% having severe disease; and <1% having critical disease.16 Among U.S. COVID-19 cases with known disposition, the proportion of persons who were hospitalized was 19%.37 The proportion of persons with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) was 6%.37\n\nClinical Progression\nAmong patients who developed severe disease, the median time to dyspnea from the onset of illness or symptoms ranged from 5 to 8 days, the median time to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from the onset of illness or symptoms ranged from 8 to 12 days, and the median time to ICU admission from the onset of illness or symptoms ranged from 10 to 12 days.5,6,10,11 Clinicians should be aware of the potential for some patients to rapidly deteriorate one week after illness onset. Among all hospitalized patients, a range of 26% to 32% of patients were admitted to the ICU.6,8,11 Among all patients, a range of 3% to 17% developed ARDS compared to a range of 20% to 42% for hospitalized patients and 67% to 85% for patients admitted to the ICU.1,4-6,8,11 Mortality among patients admitted to the ICU ranges from 39% to 72% depending on the study and characteristics of patient population.5,8,10,11 The median length of hospitalization among survivors was 10 to 13 days.1,6,8\n\nRisk Factors for Severe Illness\nAge is a strong risk factor for severe illness, complications, and death.1,6,8,14,36-40 Among >44,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, the case fatality rate was highest among older persons: \u226580 years, 14.8%; 70\u201379 years, 8.0%; 60\u201369 years, 3.6%; 50\u201359 years, 1.3%; 40\u201349 years, 0.4%; <40 years, 0.2%.36,41 In early U.S. epidemiologic data, case fatality was highest in persons aged \u226585 years (range 10%\u201327%), followed by those aged 65-84 years (3%\u201311%), aged 55-64 years (1%\u20133%), and aged <55 years (<1%).37\n\nPatients in China with no reported underlying medical conditions had an overall case fatality of 0.9%. Case fatality was higher for patients with comorbidities: 10.5% for those with cardiovascular disease, 7.3% for those with diabetes, and approximately 6% for those with chronic respiratory disease, or cancer.1,6,14,36,38,41,42    Prior stroke, diabetes, chronic lung disease, and chronic kidney disease have all been associated with increased illness severity and adverse outcomes. Serious heart conditions, including heart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and pulmonary hypertension, may put people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. People with hypertension may be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 and should continue to take their medications as prescribed. At this time, people whose only underlying medical condition is hypertension are not considered to be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.43,44\n\nAccounting for differences in age and prevalence of underlying condition, mortality associated with COVID-19 reported in the United States has been similar to reports from China.26,37,39\n\nReinfection\nThere are limited data about reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 after recovery from COVID-19.\u200b84, 85 While viral RNA shedding declines with resolution of symptoms, it may continue for days to weeks.34,38,45 However, the detection of RNA during convalescence does not necessarily indicate the presence of viable infectious virus. Clinical infection has been correlated with the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies.46-49 However, definitive data are lacking, and it remains uncertain whether individuals with antibodies are protected against reinfection with SARS-CoV-2, and if so, what concentration of antibodies is needed to confer protection.\n\nViral Testing\nDiagnosis of COVID-19 requires detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA is better in nasopharynx samples compared to throat samples.34,50 Lower respiratory samples may have better yield than upper respiratory samples.34,50 SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected in stool and blood.15,45,47,51 Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood may be a marker of severe illness.52 Viral RNA shedding may persist over longer periods among older persons and those who had severe illness requiring hospitalization (median range of viral shedding among hospitalized patients 12\u201320 days).34,38,45,46,53\n\nInfection with both SARS-CoV-2 and with other respiratory viruses has been reported, and detection of another respiratory pathogen does not rule out COVID-19.54\n\nFor more information about testing and specimen collection, handling and storage, visit Evaluating and Testing Persons for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Frequently Asked Questions on COVID-19 Testing at Laboratories.\n\nLaboratory and Radiographic Findings\nLaboratory Findings\nLymphopenia is the most common laboratory finding in COVID-19, and is found in as many as 83% of hospitalized patients.1,5 Lymphopenia, neutrophilia, elevated serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, high CRP, and high ferritin levels may be associated with greater illness severity.1,5,6,8,38,55 Elevated D-dimer and lymphopenia have been associated with mortality.8,38 Procalcitonin is typically normal on admission, but may increase among those admitted to an ICU.4-6 Patients with critical illness had high plasma levels of inflammatory makers, suggesting potential immune dysregulation.5,56\n\nRadiographic Findings\nChest radiographs of patients with COVID-19 typically demonstrate bilateral air-space consolidation, though patients may have unremarkable chest radiographs early in the disease.1,5,57 Chest CT images from patients with COVID-19 typically demonstrate bilateral, peripheral ground glass opacities.4,8,36,58-67 Because this chest CT imaging pattern is non-specific and overlaps with other infections, the diagnostic value of chest CT imaging for COVID-19 may be low and dependent upon radiographic interpretation.59,68 One study found that 56% of patients who presented within two days of diagnosis had a normal CT.60 Conversely, other studies have identified chest CT abnormalities in patients prior to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.58,69 Given the variability in chest imaging findings, chest radiograph or CT alone is not recommended for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The American College of Radiology also does not recommend CT for screening, or as a first-line test for diagnosis of COVID-19. (See American College of Radiology Recommendationsexternal icon).\n\nClinical Management and Treatment\nThe National Institutes of Health published guidelines on prophylaxis use, testing, and management of patients with COVID-19. For more information, please visit National Institutes of Health: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Treatment Guidelinesexternal icon. The recommendations were based on scientific evidence and expert opinion and will be updated as more data become available.\n\nMild to Moderate Disease\nPatients with a mild clinical presentation (absence of viral pneumonia and hypoxia) may not initially require hospitalization, and many patients will be able to manage their illness at home. The decision to monitor a patient in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend on the clinical presentation, requirement for supportive care, potential risk factors for severe disease, and the ability of the patient to self-isolate at home. Patients with risk factors for severe illness (see People Who Are at Higher Risk for Severe Illness) should be monitored closely given the possible risk of progression to severe illness, especially in the second week after symptom onset.5,6,14,38\n\nFor information regarding infection prevention and control recommendations, please see Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings.\n\nSevere Disease\nSome patients with COVID-19 will have severe disease requiring hospitalization for management. Inpatient management revolves around the supportive management of the most common complications of severe COVID-19: pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS, sepsis and septic shock, cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia, acute kidney injury, and complications from prolonged hospitalization, including secondary bacterial infections, thromboembolism, gastrointestinal bleeding, and critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy.1,4-6,14,36,38,70-73\n\nMore information can be found at National Institutes of Health: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Treatment Guidelinesexternal icon and Healthcare Professionals: Frequently Asked Questions and Answers. Additional resources and guidance documents on the treatment and management of COVID-19, including inpatient management of critically ill patients, are provided below.\n\nHypercoagulability and COVID-19\nSome patients with COVID-19 may develop signs of a hypercoagulable state and be at increased risk for venous and arterial thrombosis of large and small vessels.74,75  Laboratory abnormalities commonly observed among hospitalized patients with COVID-19-associated coagulopathy include:\n\nMild thrombocytopenia\nIncreased D-dimer levels\nIncreased fibrin degradation products\nProlonged prothrombin time\nElevated D-dimer levels have been strongly associated with greater risk of death.74,76-79\n\nThere are several reports of hospitalized patients with thrombotic complications, most frequently deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.80-82 Other reported manifestations include:\n\nMicrovascular thrombosis of the toes\nClotting of catheters\nMyocardial injury with ST-segment elevation\nLarge vessel strokes83-86\nThe pathogenesis for COVID-19-associated hypercoagulability remains unknown. However, hypoxia and systemic inflammation secondary to COVID-19 may lead to high levels of inflammatory cytokines and activation of the coagulation pathway.\n\nThere are limited data available to inform clinical management around prophylaxis or treatment of venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients.\n\nSeveral national professional associations provide resources for up-to-date information concerning COVID-19-associated hypercoagulability, including management of anticoagulation. This is a rapidly evolving topic, with new information released often.\n\nMore information on hypercoagulability and COVID-19 is available from the American Society of Hematology external iconand National Institutes of Health: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Treatment Guidelines \u2013 Antithrombotic Therapy in Patients with COVID-19external icon.\n\nPediatric Management\nIllness among pediatric patients with COVID-19 is typically milder than among adults. Most children present with symptoms of upper respiratory infection. However, severe outcomes have been reported in children, including deaths. Data suggest that infants (<12 months of age) may be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 compared with older children.16 CDC and partners are also investigating reports of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19.\n\nFor expanded guidance on the management of children with COVID-19 and associated complications, see Evaluation and Management Considerations for Neonates At Risk for COVID-19, Information for Pediatric Healthcare Providers, and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign International Guidelines for the Management of Septic Shock and Sepsis-Associated Organ Dysfunction in Childrenexternal icon.\n\nInvestigational Therapeutics\nThe National Institutes of Health have published interim guidelines for the medical management of COVID-19external icon which include information on therapeutic options for COVID-19 currently under investigation. No U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs have demonstrated safety and efficacy in randomized controlled trials when used to treat patients with COVID-19, although FDA has granted an Emergency Use Authorization for the use of remdesivirexternal icon to treat severe cases. Use of investigational therapies for treatment of COVID-19 should ideally be done in the context of enrollment in randomized controlled trials, so that beneficial drugs can be identified. For the latest information, see Information for Clinicians on Therapeutic Options for COVID-19 Patients. For information on registered trials in the United States, see ClinicalTrials.govexternal icon.\n\nDiscontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions or Home Isolation\nPatients who have clinically recovered and are able to discharge from the hospital, but who have not been cleared from their Transmission-Based Precautions, may continue isolation at their place of residence until cleared. For recommendations on discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions or home isolation for patients who have recovered from COVID-19, please see:\n\nInterim Guidance for Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions and Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19\nInterim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19",

            "Text": "We are still learning about how the virus that causes COVID-19 can affect animals.  A small number of pets (cats and dogs) have been confirmed to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with a person with COVID-19. Some pets did not show any signs of illness, but those pets that did get sick all had mild disease that could be taken care of at home. None of the pets have died. Tests for COVID-19 in animals are available for most types of pets, but testing is only recommended for animals with COVID-19 symptoms and that have been exposed to a person with COVID-19.\n\nBased on the limited information available now, the risk of pets spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. There is no reason to abandon or surrender pets that have been confirmed positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nIf you are sick with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.  Call your veterinarian first and tell them you are sick with COVID-19. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.  Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and decide the appropriate steps for your pet\u2019s care.\n\nIf your pet is tested for COVID-19 and is confirmed to be infected\nDepending on how sick your pet is, your veterinarian may recommend that your pet be isolated at home, instead of staying in the hospital.  Some pets did not show any signs of illness, but those pets that did get sick all had mild disease that could be taken care of at home.\n\nIf your veterinarian recommends home isolation and you are able to care for your pet at home, follow this advice to protect yourself and others.\n\nWhat to do if your pet gets sick\nKeep your pet at home, except to get medical care\nTalk with your veterinarian regularly. Call before you take your pet to the veterinary clinic. Be sure to alert your veterinarian if your pet has trouble breathing, or if you think it is an emergency.\nWhile most pets appear to show only mild symptoms or no symptoms, we are still learning about how they are affected by the virus. Even if your pet appears to be feeling better, avoid the following activities until your veterinarian determines that it is safe for your pet to do so or your pet has met the guidance to end their isolation:\nVisits to veterinary hospitals, without calling the veterinarian first\nVisits to human healthcare facilities or schools\nVisits to parks (including dog parks), markets, or other gatherings such as festivals\nVisits to the groomer, including mobile grooming salons\nVisits to pet daycares or boarding facilities\nOther outings such as playdates, hikes, or visiting other homes, with or without pets\nUsing dog walkers or pet-sitters that live outside your home\nSeparate your pet from other people and pets in your home\nHave the pet stay in a designated \u201csick room\u201d (such as a laundry room or extra bathroom) if possible, or otherwise be separated from people and other animals. This is the same way a person with COVID-19 would separate from others in their household.\nAvoid contact with the pet as much as possible, including, petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food or bedding.\nIf possible, provide a separate litterbox or bathroom area from other pets.\nDOGS: If you have a private backyard where your dog can go to the bathroom, do not take them for walks. If you must walk your dog, limit it to bathroom breaks only, stay close to your home, and keep your pet at least 6 feet away from other pets and people. Do not let other people touch or interact with your dog.\n\nCATS: Cats should be kept inside. Do not allow cats that have tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 to roam outside.\n\nCLEANING UP: There is no evidence to suggest that waste from infected pets needs any additional disinfection. Wear gloves when cleaning up after your pet, and place fecal material or litterbox waste in a sealed bag before disposing. Always wash your hands with soap and water immediately after cleaning up after your pet.\n\nProvide bedding, bowls or containers, treats, and toys that are separate from those used by other people or animals in the household.\nDisinfect bowls, toys, and other animal care items with an EPA-registered disinfectantexternal icon and rinse thoroughly with clean water afterwards.\nSoft items like towels, blankets, and other bedding, can be safely laundered and reused. Dirty laundry that has been in contact with an ill animal can be washed with other items.\nMonitor your pet\u2019s symptoms\nIt is important to keep track of your pet\u2019s symptoms during home isolation. If you think your pet has new symptoms or is getting worse, call your veterinarian.\n\nPets sick with COVID-19 may have:\n\nFever\nCoughing\nDifficulty breathing or shortness of breath\nLethargy (unusual laziness or sluggish)\nSneezing\nRunny nose\nEye discharge\nVomiting\nDiarrhea\nFollow all care instructions from your veterinarian.  Your veterinarian may have you keep a written log of your pet\u2019s symptoms.\n\nIf your pet develops new symptoms or seems to be getting worse, including trouble breathing, you should call your veterinarian right away.  Your veterinarian may be able to advise you over the phone or may tell you to bring your pet to their clinic or go to another clinic that can better care for your pet.\n\nProtect yourself when caring for a sick pet\nFollow similar recommended precautions as for people caring for an infected person at home.\nIf you are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, another household member should care for the pet, if possible.\nPeople should wear a mask and gloves  in the same room or area as the sick pet.\nAnimals should not wear a mask. Do not try to put a mask on your pet.\nUse gloves when handling the pet\u2019s dishes, toys, or bedding and when picking up feces (poop). Throw out gloves and place waste material or litterbox waste in a sealed bag before throwing away in a trashcan lined with a trash bag. Always wash your hands with soap and water immediately after cleaning up after your pet.\nClean your hands regularly throughout the day.\nWash hands: Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds each  Make sure everyone in the home does the same, especially after touching the sick pet or handling their dishes, toys, or bedding.\nHand sanitizer: If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.  Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.\nDo not touch your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.\nClean and then disinfect:\nFollow cleaning and disinfecting recommendations found on CDC\u2019s Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Home\nDo not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other products, such as hand sanitizer, counter-cleaning wipes, or other industrial or surface cleaners. There is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people or other animals from the skin, fur, or hair of pets. Using chemical disinfectants on your pet could make them very sick or kill them. Talk to your veterinarian\u200b if you have questions about appropriate products for bathing or cleaning your pet.\nWhen it is safe for your pet to be around others: ending home isolation\nFollow your veterinarian\u2019s advice for when it is safe for your pet to be around other people and animals. Some pets may need follow-up testing to see if they are still positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Monitoring, isolation, and movement restrictions can end for positive pets if:\n\nThe animal has not shown clinical signs consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection for at least 72 hours without medical management;\nAND one of the following conditions:\n\nIt has been at least 14 days since their last positive test from a lab that uses a validated SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR diagnostic assay;\nOR\n\nAll sample types collected at follow-up are negative by a validated SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR diagnostic assay.",

Persons who are severely immunocompromised may require testing to determine when they can be around others. Talk to your healthcare provider for more information. If testing is available in your community, it may be recommended by your healthcare provider.

            "HeadLine": "Contact Tracing for COVID-19",
            "Text": "For COVID-19, a close contact is defined as any individual who was within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes starting from 2 days before illness onset (or, for asymptomatic patients, 2 days prior to positive specimen collection) until the time the patient is isolated.\n\nThe public health evaluation of close contacts to patients with laboratory-confirmed or probable COVID-19 may vary depending on the exposure setting. Contacts in special populations and/or congregate settings require additional considerations and may need handoff to a senior health department investigator or special team. Additional guidance on managing these contacts can be found in Outbreak Investigations.\n\nClose Contact Evaluation and Monitoring Priorities\nIn jurisdictions with testing capacity, symptomatic and asymptomatic close contacts to patients with confirmed and probable COVID-19 should be evaluated and monitored. For areas with insufficient testing support and/or limited public health resources, the following evaluation and monitoring hierarchy (Box 4) can be used to help guide prioritization. The hierarchy is based on the assumption that if close contacts listed in Priority 1 become infected, they could potentially expose many people, those at higher risk for severe disease, or critical infrastructure workers. If close contacts in Priority 2 become infected, they may be at higher risk for severe disease, so prompt notification, monitoring, and linkage to needed medical and support services is important.\n\nWhen prioritizing close contacts to evaluate and monitor, jurisdictions should be guided by the local characteristics of disease transmission, demographics, and public health and healthcare system capacity. Some states require mandatory testing for specific circumstances. Local decisions depend on local guidance and circumstances.\n\nBox 4. Close Contact Evaluation and Monitoring Hierarchy\nEVALUATE/MONITOR CLOSE CONTACTS WHO ARE:\n\nPRIORITY 1\n\nHospitalized patients\nHealthcare personnel (HCP)\nFirst responders (e.g., EMS, law enforcement, firefighters)\nIndividuals living, working or visiting acute care, skilled nursing, mental health, and long-term care facilities\nIndividuals living, working or visiting community congregate settings (e.g., correctional facilities, homeless shelters, educational institutions, mass gatherings, and workplaces including production plants)\nMember of a large household living in close quarters\nIndividuals who live in households with a higher risk individual or who provide care in a household with a higher risk individual (Note: Household members who likely had extensive contact with a patient with COVID-19 should constitute the highest risk close contacts.)\nPRIORITY 2\n\nCritical infrastructure workers*\nIndividuals 65 years of age and older\nIndividuals at higher risk for severe disease\nPregnant women\nPRIORITY 3\n\nIndividuals with symptoms who do not meet any of the above categories\nPRIORITY 4\n\nIndividuals without symptoms who do not meet any of the above categories\n*Consider moving to Priority 1 any critical infrastructure worker who works closely with other critical infrastructure workers and/or is in close contact with large numbers of people (e.g., transportation, food service).\n\nNote: Boxes 1-3 can be found under the \u201cInvestigating a COVID-19 Case\u201d section of the guidance.\n\nContact tracers use clear protocols to notify, interview, and advise close contacts to patients with confirmed or probable COVID-19. Jurisdictions can use the following steps and considerations as a framework when developing a protocol for the tracing of close contacts. Step 1: Rapid Notification of Exposure\nFor contacts in your health department\u2019s jurisdiction:\n\nA close contact to a patient with confirmed or probable COVID-19 should be notified of their exposure as soon as possible (within 24 hours of contact elicitation). The patient may elect to notify some or all of their close contacts before the contact tracer.\nThe identity of the patient or other identifying information will not be revealed, alluded to, or confirmed by the contact tracer, even if explicitly asked by a contact.\nContacts can be notified through different channels such as phone, text, email, or in-person (if appropriate) in the primary language of the individual. Special consideration should be given to ensure culturally and linguistically appropriate communications, if possible. The protocol should clearly outline the primary and secondary means of notifying a contact.\nProtocols should be in place to provide services to people who are deaf or who have hearing loss.\nDepending on the information elicited during the case investigation, locating information for the contact may be insufficient. Tips on additional resources that may be used to obtain missing locating information can be found in Appendix B. Every effort should be made to reach the contact remotely before attempting in-person communication.\nOperational Questions to Consider\n\nWho will conduct contact notification in your jurisdiction? (e.g., case investigators, other public health staff, volunteers, contracted staff)\nHow will you collaborate to transfer contact information from one jurisdiction to another to ensure notification of exposure for contacts outside of your jurisdiction?\nHow can your jurisdiction incorporate existing or new technology (e.g., mobile app) into a contact tracer\u2019s workflow to speed up contact notification?\nWhen is in-person notification needed? Contact tracers expected to perform in-person notification need appropriate training on infection prevention and control practices and must obtain any necessary PPE prior to conducting in-person activities.\nWill contact tracers be asked to notify a client\u2019s household contacts/known contacts, or will the client be asked to make these notifications?\nHow will notification of exposure be handled for minors?\nIf an entire household is exposed, will there be one point of contact for the household or separate contacts for every household member?\nHow will a contact tracer follow up with a contact if the client makes the notification?\nHow will you work with employers when many contacts are within a work setting?\nStep 2: Contact Interview\nEvery effort should be made to interview the close contact by telephone, text, or video conference instead of in-person. The interview should be conducted in the individual\u2019s primary language (through interpretation services, if necessary). For in-person interviews, guidance on recommended infection prevention and control practices at a home or non-home residential setting can be found on CDC\u2019s Evaluating PUIs Residential page.\nAppendix C includes critical data elements that can be incorporated into a jurisdiction\u2019s form used to interview contacts to assess symptoms, better characterize their underlying risk for infection, and assess home and social factors that could impact compliance with self-quarantine.\nNotification of Exposure \u2013 A Contact Tracer\u2019s Guide for COVID-19 focuses on communication strategies for contact interviews and provides suggested language for each topic area covered in an interview.\nOperational Questions to Consider\n\nIf a contact needs to be interviewed via an interpreter, how will those services be accessed?\nHow will your jurisdiction navigate confidentiality challenges when the calendar date of an exposure easily reveals who may have exposed a contact to COVID-19?\nWhat steps will be taken if a contact is unwilling or unable to be interviewed or cannot be located?\nTop of Page\nStep 2a: Quarantine/Isolation Instructions and Testing\nQuarantine/Isolation instructions\nClose contacts who were not diagnosed with COVID-19 within the last 90 days:\nThose with no symptoms will be asked to self-quarantine for 14 days from their last potential exposure and should be considered for testing. The last potential exposure would initially be determined by the case investigator. See Sample Quarantine Instructions for Close Contacts with No Symptoms\nThose with symptoms should immediately self-isolate for 10 days after symptom onset and be referred for testing and medical care. Negative test results for contacts do not change the length of quarantine. It is still 14 days.\nClose contacts who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by either (1) a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA within the last 90 days or (2) a healthcare provider based on their symptoms, and 90 days or less have passed since their symptoms began.\nThose with no current symptoms of COVID-19 do not have to quarantine, and retesting is not recommended.\nThose with symptoms, should begin self-isolation immediately for 10 days after symptom onset and consult with a medical provider to determine if they may have been re-infected with SARS-CoV-2 or if symptoms are caused by another etiology. Contacts with no primary healthcare provider will need to be connected to telemedicine (e.g., videoconference or phone consultation). Negative test results for contacts do not change the length of quarantine. It is still 14 days.\nAdvise contacts to cancel or postpone plans that involve social gatherings, vacations or other planned travel until cleared for these activities by public health authorities (based on the guidance above).\nLocal and state health departments may request federal public health travel restrictions, which prevent listed travelers from boarding commercial airplanes and trigger public health notification if they enter the United States by land or sea, to support state- or local-mandated quarantine or isolation for contacts.\nSupport with federal public health travel restrictions may be requested by public health partners by contacting the CDC quarantine station with jurisdiction for the area.\nIf needed, jurisdictions should refer clients for social support services (for example, food, childcare, housing, and other services) to help encourage clients to stay at home and comply with quarantine or isolation.\nIf contacts refuse to comply voluntarily with self-quarantine or self-isolation instructions, jurisdictions should consider what options (e.g., legal order for isolation) are available to them under relevant state or local legal authority.\nTesting Instructions\nIf resources permit, jurisdictions should arrange for all close contacts to be tested, as appropriate.\nRegarding test results by RT-PCR for SARS CoV-2 RNA for contacts with no previous COVID-19 infection in the past 90 days:\nIf test results are positive, close contacts will be referred to a case investigator.\nIf test results are negative:\nAsymptomatic close contacts should continue to self-quarantine for a full 14 days after last exposure and follow all recommendations of public health authorities.\nSymptomatic close contacts should continue to self-quarantine until symptom resolution as recommended by public health authorities. A second test and additional medical consultation may be needed if symptoms do not improve.\nIf testing is not available, symptomatic close contacts should be advised to self-isolate for 14 days and be managed as a probable case. Self-isolation is recommended for people with probable or confirmed COVID-19 who have mild illness and are able to recover at home.\nAll close contacts should be educated about COVID-19 symptoms to monitor for and be instructed to promptly report any new symptoms to public health authorities and seek medical care when necessary.\nSample Quarantine Instructions for Close Contacts with No Symptoms\nSelf-quarantine, preferably at home, until 14 days after the last potential exposure, maintain social distance (at least 6 feet) from others at all times, and follow all CDC guidance on self-quarantine.\nSelf-monitor daily for symptoms. [NOTE: Include instructions on how close contacts can report symptoms to the health department and agreed upon reporting times.]\nIf you have a thermometer, check and record your temperature twice a day. Thermometers should not be shared.\nContact a healthcare provider immediately if you:\nFeel feverish or have a temperature of 100.4\u2070F or higher.\nDevelop a cough or shortness of breath.\nHave persistent pain or pressure in your chest.\nDevelop new confusion.\nAre unable to wake up or stay awake.\nHave bluish lips or face.\nDevelop mild symptoms like sore throat, muscle aches, tiredness, or diarrhea.\nAvoid contact with people at higher risk for severe illness (unless they live in the same home and had the same exposure as you).\nFollow CDC guidance if you develop symptoms.\n\nOperational Questions to Consider\n\nUnder what circumstances will quarantine be mandatory (under public health orders) as opposed to voluntary?\nWho will be referred for testing (e.g., symptomatic, asymptomatic) and how (e.g., testing site, home test kit)?\nHow will contacts be checked against databases of already confirmed cases to ensure they are not already in self-isolation?\nWill contact tracers be collecting diagnostic respiratory specimens?\nHow will contacts be monitored for self-quarantine compliance?\nWhat services are available in the community to support workers who need to stay home and self-quarantine?\nHow can your jurisdiction incorporate technology, such as a mobile app or online tool, to assist with active monitoring of close contacts (e.g., symptom reporting, temperature checks)?\nCan your jurisdiction supply a letter/email to close contacts documenting their need to self-quarantine for a specified date range? Contacts could provide this to their employers to verify the reason for a work absence.\nTop of Page\nStep 2b: Assessing Self-Quarantine Support Needs\nEmphasis should be placed on helping contacts identify any need for social support during self-quarantine.\n\nSelf-quarantine of close contacts exposed to COVID-19 prevents transmission to others and is critical to the success of case investigation and contact tracing efforts. For most, self-quarantine can take place at home. If possible, contacts should be asked to voluntarily stay home, monitor themselves, and maintain social distance from others. The timeframe for self-quarantine is 14 days following the last day of exposure to a patient with COVID-19, to ensure that the contact does not get sick themselves and spread the virus to others. Adherence to self-quarantine instructions may depend on the support provided to contacts.\n\nSelf-quarantine requires that a contact remain in a specific room separate from other non-exposed people and pets in the home, and ideally with access to a separate bathroom. First and foremost, the contact tracer should assess an individual\u2019s ability to self-quarantine in a safe environment that provides access to a private room and bathroom, as well as access to adequate food and water among other considerations. For a portion of the US population, self-quarantine at home will be a challenge. It will be particularly difficult for some of the most vulnerable populations.\n\nConsiderations must also be made for close contacts who express fear of abuse or violence if they must self-quarantine at home. Additionally, some contacts (e.g., single parents, nursing mothers, parents with children and toddlers, and other primary caregivers) may face other challenges, such as childcare or dependent adult care, that may affect their ability to self-quarantine. Social services, housing and other supportive services will be needed for those contacts who are unable to separate themselves from others in their current living situation. See Support Services for further considerations.\n\nClose contacts will also need to be supported with health coaching to ensure daily monitoring of temperature and the onset of any COVID-19 symptoms and have access to clinical services should symptoms appear. Coordination of access to telehealth services may be needed for contacts without virtual access to a primary care provider. All close contacts entering a 14-day self-quarantine period should be provided a COVID-19 kit with the following resources*:\n\nWashable cloth face covering\nGloves\nDigital thermometer\nAlcohol-based hand sanitizer, soap, EPA-registered household disinfectantexternal icon\nCOVID-19 health education materials (translated into the appropriate language)\nInstructions for cleaning and disinfecting your home for those sharing space with others\nA hotline/warmline to address any support needs during the self-quarantine period, including medical support\n*The composition of the COVID-19 kit will depend on the jurisdiction\u2019s resources.\n\nOperational Questions to Consider\n\nAre there other resources that your jurisdiction can share to provide health advice and answer questions? (e.g., mobile app, hotline/call center, CDC Coronavirus Symptom Self-Checker, CDC-INFO)\nStep 3: Medical Monitoring\nContacts who agree to self-quarantine will ideally receive active daily monitoring through real-time communication methods (e.g., telephone calls, video conferencing) to check-in on their temperature and COVID-19 symptoms throughout the length of their self-quarantine.\nIf a jurisdiction\u2019s resources do not allow for active daily monitoring, contacts will be asked to self-monitor and communicate remotely (e.g., email, recorded video, telephone message, text, monitoring apps) to notify public health authorities of their health status and promptly communicate any new symptoms or symptoms of increasing severity. A daily temperature/symptom logpdf icon can be provided to the contact electronically to aid in self-monitoring.\nFor those individuals self-monitoring and sharing reports remotely, reports must be received by the agreed upon time each day, and protocol must address follow-up actions for contacts who do not report out.\nContacts who develop and report symptoms should be linked to clinical care and testing. For contacts who report testing, follow up to confirm results.\nIf positive, the contact will be referred to a case investigator.\nIf negative, symptomatic contacts should continue to self-quarantine and follow all recommendations of public health authorities. A second test and additional medical consultation may be needed if symptoms do not improve.\nIf testing is not available, symptomatic close contacts should be advised to self-isolate and be managed as a probable case. Self-isolation is recommended for people with probable or confirmed COVID-19 who have mild illness and are able to recover at home.\nOperational Questions to Consider\n\nWhat steps will be taken for contacts under self-monitoring who do not report as required? How intensive will the outreach be (e.g., same-day home visit)?\nStep 3a: Monitoring and Isolation Instructions\nClients with probable or confirmed COVID-19 should be advised to self-isolate immediately, if they are not doing so already. Self-isolation is recommended for people with probable or confirmed COVID-19 who have mild illness and are able to recover at home.\nIt should be made clear to the client whether the isolation instructions are voluntary or mandatory, as determined by state or local public health authorities.\nAdvise clients to cancel or postpone plans that involve social gatherings, vacations or other planned travel until cleared for these activities by public health authorities (based on the guidance above).\nLocal and state health departments may request federal public health travel restrictions, which prevent listed travelers from boarding commercial airplanes and trigger public health notification if they enter the United States by land or sea, to support state- or local-mandated isolation for infected individuals.\n\u200bSupport with federal public health travel restrictions may be requested by public health partners by contacting the CDC quarantine station with jurisdiction for the area.\nIf needed, jurisdictions should refer clients for social support services (for example, food, childcare, housing, and other services) to help encourage clients to stay at home and comply with isolation.\nIf clients refuse to comply voluntarily with self-isolation instructions, jurisdictions should consider what options (e.g., legal order for isolation) are available to them under relevant state or local legal authority.\nThe client should be informed of COVID-19 symptoms to monitor for and be instructed to get medical attention immediately if he/she experiences any emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing. Clients with no primary healthcare provider will need linkage to telemedicine or phone consultation.\nThe client should also be informed of ways to prevent infection among those living in their household.\nAdditional self-isolation guidance should be reviewed with the client and instructional materials provided. Sample materials can be found on the CDC website:\n10 things you can do to manage your COVID-19 symptoms at home pdf iconpdf icon\nWhat to Do If You Are Sick\nWhen You Can be Around Others After You Had or Likely Had COVID-19\nAll instructions should be provided in a client\u2019s primary language.\nOperational Questions to Consider\n\nUnder what circumstances will isolation be mandatory (under public health orders) as opposed to voluntary? How will this distinction be made clear to a patient?\nHow will clients be monitored for isolation compliance?\nIn the event that self-isolation is not feasible, what alternative supports exist, and/or what risk-reduction measures can be taken?\nTop of Page\nStep 4: Contact Close Out\nContacts who remain asymptomatic for 14 days after last exposure can be notified of their release from monitoring and provided general health education in their primary language.\nContacts who develop symptoms but test negative during their monitoring period should continue to self-quarantine and follow all recommendations of public health authorities. A second test and additional medical consultation may be needed if symptoms do not improve. The decision to release a contact from self-quarantine should be determined at the local level and should be communicated clearly to the contact.\nOperational Questions to Consider\n\nWill the health department send an alert notification to the individual one day prior to the end of self-quarantine to double-check signs/symptoms and authorize return to work?\nWill a \u201creturn to work\u201d letter be available to contacts who request one after completing the monitoring period?\nWill a warmline be offered to address any post-monitoring issues?",

CDC is allowing crew members to disembark from all cruise ships in U.S. waters with certain precautions. Cruise lines with complete and accurate response plans will be able to use commercial travel to disembark crew members from certain ships if the ships meet certain criteria set by CDC including that there have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 or COVID-like illnesses on board the ship within the last 28 days. These ships are also able to lessen certain social distancing restrictions onboard. Cruise lines with complete and accurate response plans under the No Sail Order but not meeting the above criteria will still be able to disembark their crew members using non-commercial travel. Cruise lines must have measures in place to ensure those involved in transport are not exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19 and follow all CDC requirements to prevent interaction of disembarking crew with the public.\n\nCriteria for Commercial Transport of Crew\nLearn more about Cruise Ship Crew Member Disembarkations during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nShips that are requesting the use of commercial travel for disembarking crew members will need to meet the following criteria:\n\nA response plan under the No Sail Order that is complete and accurate\nThis does not mean ships are allowed to resume passenger travel, but rather that they have met CDC\u2019s requirements to provide a safe environment for crew members to work and to disembark crew safely by non-commercial travel.\nCruise company officials must sign an acknowledgment of the completeness and accuracy of their response plan.\nNo confirmed cases of COVID-19[1] or COVID-like illness[2] for 28 days, as determined by a qualified medical professional.\nIf the ship has received ship-to-ship transfers, the crew must have come from a ship that had no confirmed cases of COVID-19 or COVID-like illness within the 28 days before the transfer occurred.\nIf land-based crew embarked, they were immediately quarantined for 14 days upon embarking the ship.\nSubmission of a signed attestation for commercial travel.\nMeeting these criteria does not mean cruise ships can resume passenger operations. We don\u2019t have enough information at this time to say when it will be safe to resume sailing with passengers. Cruise lines may need to establish additional safety measures before sailing with passengers is permitted to resume. CDC will continue to evaluate and update its recommendations as the situation evolves.\n\nAll cruise ships operating in U.S. waters, or seeking to operate in U.S. waters, must comply with all of the  requirements under the No Sail Order and Interim Guidance During the Period of the No Sail Order for the entire period of the No Sail Order even when outside U.S. waters.\n\nAs ships become eligible to transport crew members commercially, this page will provide a list of cruise ships meeting those criteria.\n\nConfirmed COVID-19 means laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing\nCOVID-like illness means acute respiratory illness (ARI), influenza-like illness (ILI), or diagnosis of pneumonia.\nStatus of No Sail Order Response Plans and Commercial Transport of Crew\nAs a prerequisite for requesting commercial travel, cruise lines must have a complete and accurate response plan that provides a safe environment for crew members to work and disembark during the period of the No Sail Order.

A cruise ship operator must be in compliance with the No Sail Order, the operator\u2019s No Sail Order response plan, and CDC\u2019s Interim Guidance for Mitigation of COVID-19 Among Cruise Ship Crew During the Period of the No Sail Order. CDC assesses compliance through implementation checks on a sample of ships covered under a cruise ship operator\u2019s plan. There must be no evidence of noncompliance.\n\nWhat steps is CDC taking to make sure ships stay in compliance with the criteria for commercial transport of crew?\nCDC will review weekly surveillance data provided by ships, and only those ships that continue to report no cases of COVID-19 or COVID-like illness will maintain this status.\n\nWhat other changes can cruise ships make if they meet these criteria?\nCDC is committed to helping cruise lines provide for the safety and well-being of their crew members onboard. As cruise ships are able to show they have no cases of confirmed COVID-19 or COVID-like illnesses on board, crew members will be able to resume some of their daily interactions with fellow crew members.\n\nSome examples of decreased restrictions on cruise ships if they meet these criteria include resuming in-person meetings, events, and social gatherings; reopening bars, gyms, or other group settings onboard for crew member use; and removing requirements to wear face coverings.\n\nWhat is the difference between the two attestations CDC requires under the No Sail Order?\nUnder the No Sail Order, cruise lines are required to develop and implement comprehensive plans to prevent, detect, respond to, and contain COVID-19 among crew members onboard. While these response plans have been under review, CDC has allowed cruise lines to disembark crew members if they submit a signed attestation stating they have complied with the requirements to safely disembark crew members. This attestation included a requirement that crew members only use noncommercial travel to disembark and reach their final destinations and do not interact with the public during travel.\n\nCruise lines that have a complete and accurate No Sail Order response plan may disembark crew members without a signed attestation if they use noncommercial travel and follow CDC requirements. Cruise company officials must sign an acknowledgment of the completeness and accuracy of their response plan. Cruise ships that want to use commercial travel for crew members must meet additional requirements, which include demonstrating there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 or COVID-like illness on board and submitting a signed attestation for commercial travel.\n\nWhat does it mean if a cruise line is not listed on the table above?\nIf a cruise line is not listed, it means the cruise line is not operating and does not plan to operate any of its ships in U.S. waters during the period of the No Sail Order.\n\nWhat does it mean if a cruise ship is not listed on the table above?\nIf a cruise ship is not listed, it means the ship is not operating in U.S. waters and does not plan to operate in U.S. waters during the period of the No Sail Order.",

About the Data\nThis page is updated weekly on Thursday at 1:00pm ET based on data collected by Tuesday at 12:30pm ET. The cases reported are only confirmed cases with laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nThere are currently 56 U.S.-affiliated jurisdictions reporting cases of COVID-19. This includes 50 states, District of Columbia, Guam, New York City, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S Virgin Islands.\n\nBecause only about a quarter of case report forms include information on pregnancy status, these numbers likely do not include all pregnant women with COVID-19 in the United States and must be interpreted with caution. The completeness of this variable continues to improve each week. Increases in the total number of cases of COVID-19 among pregnant women are largely due to the updating of pregnancy status among already reported cases. Case numbers reported on other websites may differ from what is posted on CDC\u2019s website because CDC\u2019s overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with each jurisdiction. Differences between reporting jurisdictions and CDC\u2019s website may occur because of the timing of reporting and website updates. The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by other sites may differ. Case counts may fluctuate from week to week due to data quality and cleaning processes.",

            "Text": "Quarantine is used to keep someone who might have been exposed to COVID-19 away from others. Quarantine helps prevent spread of disease that can occur before a person knows they are sick or if they are infected with the virus without feeling symptoms. People in quarantine should stay home, separate themselves from others, monitor their health, and follow directions from their state or local health department.\n\nQuarantine or isolation: What's the difference?\n\nQuarantine keeps someone who might have been exposed to the virus away from others.\n\nIsolation keeps someone who is infected with the virus away from others, even in their home.\n\nWho needs to quarantine?\n\nPeople who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19\u2014excluding people who have had COVID-19 within the past 3 months.\n\nPeople who have tested positive for COVID-19 do not need to quarantine or get tested again for up to 3 months as long as they do not develop symptoms again. People who develop symptoms again within 3 months of their first bout of COVID-19 may need to be tested again if there is no other cause identified for their symptoms.\n\nWhat counts as close contact?\n\nYou were within 6 feet of someone who has COVID-19 for a total of 15 minutes or more\nYou provided care at home to someone who is sick with COVID-19\nYou had direct physical contact with the person (hugged or kissed them)\nYou shared eating or drinking utensils\nThey sneezed, coughed, or somehow got respiratory droplets on you\nSteps to take\n\nStay home and monitor your health\n\nStay home for 14 days after your last contact with a person who has COVID-19\nWatch for fever (100.4\u25e6F), cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19\nIf possible, stay away from others, especially people who are at higher risk for getting very sick from COVID-19\nWhen to start and end quarantine\nYou should stay home for 14 days after your last contact with a person who has COVID-19.\n\nFor all of the following scenarios, even if you test negative for COVID-19 or feel healthy, you should stay home (quarantine) since symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus.\n\nSee scenarios below to determine when you can end quarantine and be around others.\n\nScenario 1: Close contact with someone who has COVID-19\u2014will not have further close contact\nI had close contact with someone who has COVID-19 and will not have further contact or interactions with the person while they are sick (e.g., co-worker, neighbor, or friend).\n\nYour last day of quarantine is 14 days from the date you had close contact.\n\nDate of last close contact with person who has COVID-19 + 14 days= end of quarantine Scenario 2: Close contact with someone who has COVID-19\u2014live with the person but can avoid further close contact\nI live with someone who has COVID-19 (e.g., roommate, partner, family member), and that person has isolated by staying in a separate bedroom.

This strategy is consistent with the current phase of the pandemic and more effectively protects the health of the American public.\n\nBeginning September 14, 2020, the USG will remove requirements for directing all flights carrying airline passengers arriving from, or recently had a presence in, certain countries to land at one of 15 designated airports and halt enhanced entry health screening for these passengers. Currently, enhanced entry health screening is conducted for those arriving from, or with recent presence in, China (excluding the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau), Iran, the Schengen region of Europe, the United Kingdom (excluding overseas territories outside of Europe), Ireland, and Brazil.\n\nWe now have a better understanding of COVID-19 transmission that indicates symptom-based screening has limited effectiveness because people with COVID-19 may have no symptoms or fever at the time of screening, or only mild symptoms. Transmission of the virus may occur from passengers who have no symptoms or who have not yet developed symptoms of infection. Therefore, CDC is shifting its strategy and prioritizing other public health measures to reduce the risk of travel-related disease transmission.\n\nUSG resources will instead be dedicated to more effective mitigation efforts that focus on the individual passenger, including: pre-departure, in-flight, and post-arrival health education for passengers; robust illness response at airports; voluntary collection of contact information from passengers using electronic means as proposed by some airlines to avoid long lines, crowding and delays associated with manual data collection; potential testing to reduce the risk of travel-related transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 and movement of the virus from one location to another; country-specific risk assessments to assist passengers in making informed decisions about travel-related risk; enhancing training and education of partners in the transportation sector and at United States ports of entry to ensure recognition of illness and immediate notification to CDC; and post-arrival passenger recommendations for self-monitoring and precautions to protect others, with enhanced precautions, including staying home to the extent possible for 14 days for people arriving from high-risk destinations.\n\nBy refocusing our mitigation efforts on individual passenger risk throughout the air travel journey, the USG can most effectively protect the health of the American public.",

            "Text": "Document purpose: Markets are a critical place of commerce and a source of many essential goods, but they can pose potential risks for COVID-19. This document provides suggestions for mitigating COVID-19 transmission in markets in global low-resource settings and describes considerations associated with each mitigation measure. The proposals are presented in table format and are organized by mitigation practice (physical distancing, hand hygiene, cleaning and disinfection, and respiratory hygiene).\n\nDocument audience: This document is intended for use by any person, institution, or organization preparing for or responding to cases of COVID-19 in the community, and for those assisting those organizations (federal and local governments, CDC country offices, and others).\n\nWhat this document adds to previously published guidance: This document provides suggestions that can be considered by personnel in low-resource settings outside the U.S. and can be adapted to follow national or local guidelines, and to account for local context. Local populations can be engagedpdf iconexternal icon in the planning and decision-making process by identifying trusted stakeholders and community leaders to provide feedback on proposed mitigation measures before their implementation.\n\nLayered approach: Mitigation measures in markets can be organized into three categories: personal controls, administrative controls, and engineering controls. These should be layered on top of each other to reduce overall risk of COVID-19 for customers and vendors in markets.\n\nPersonal controls: Individual behaviors to protect themselves and those around them\nAdministrative controls: Processes and policies that keep people safe\nEngineering controls: Physical structures put in place to distance people from hazards\nPhysical Distancing\nPersonal controls: General recommendations for physical distancing in markets\nMaintain at least a 2-meter distance from others and practice no-contact greetings.\n\nCustomers can also try to stay home as much as possible by combining trips to the market.\n\nAdministrative and engineering controls: Possibilities for markets1\nSpace stalls a few (2+) meters apart, use every other stall, and/or extend the market area when possible so that customers and vendors stay as far apart from each other as possible.\nConsider limiting to one vendor per stall.\nFood vendors make items take-away only (not for eating on-site).\nMake aisles and entrances/exits go in one direction only (see diagrams below).\nSet up markers for where customers should stand at stalls and check-out stations (2+ meters from the vendor/cashier and from other customers) and where to stand in queues (see diagrams below).\nExtend operating times to help space out crowding.\nConsider separate days or times (such as when the market opens, before others arrive) for people who are elderly or who have serious underlying medical conditions.\nEncourage households to send a designated family member, rather than multiple family members, to buy food and supplies. The designated family member would ideally not be elderly or have serious underlying medical conditions.\nEncourage use of digital payment tools when feasible, such as mobile money. If digital payment tools are not feasible, consider advising vendors and customers to place cash and change on a counter or other surface rather than exchanging money hand to hand. Advise vendors to clean and disinfect the surface on a routine basis.\nControl the flow of people in and out of the market by closing off some entry and exit points.\nConsider decreasing the number of customers allowed in the market at the same time. This can be done by assigning people with certain last names to certain days or times of day or setting a limit on the number of people allowed inside at once.\nConsider advising only vendors to handle food and other goods, not customers.\nFor grocery stores/supermarkets, consider installing partitions or other physical barriers between customers and cashiers at check-out stations, if feasible.\nMaterials, activities, and personnel needed for implementation\nCommunication campaigns (via radio, newspaper, social media, WhatsApp, or other platforms) so that customers understand new procedures.\nSigns and/or audio messages in formats and languages suitable for local audiences within the market explaining procedures and rationale to customers and vendors.\nPaint, chalk, or other tools for marking where to stand and walk.\nMarket staff to explain and remind customers of physical distancing rules and to help control the number of people in the market.\nSupport from local authorities.\nConsiderations and challenges for implementation\nBecause these engineering and administrative controls require oversight in order to be implemented effectively, markets without clear management structures may have difficulty implementing them.\n\nThere will be a cost associated with the development of communication materials, markings for where to walk and stand, and possibly paying additional staff to monitor physical distancing.\n\nLimiting the number of people allowed in the market could be difficult to implement and could have negative impacts on households\u2019 access to food. Hand Hygiene\nPersonal controls: General recommendations for hand hygiene in markets\nClean hands frequently. Hand hygiene is a critical way that people can reduce the risk of COVID-19. In markets, customers and vendors should clean hands upon entry and exit, before and after each transaction, and after blowing their nose, sneezing, or coughing, in addition to other key times.image iconexternal icon\n\nTypes of hand hygiene:\nHandwashing with soap and water. Soap and water are available in most contexts and are effective against coronaviruses. The cleanest water available (ideally from an improved sourceexternal icona) should be used for handwashing, and all types of soap (bar soap, liquid soap, soapy water,b and powder soap) are effective at removing germs from hands, including the virus that causes COVID-19. Hands should be scrubbed with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and dried using single-use hand drying materials when available, or air dried.\n\nCleaning with alcohol-based hand rub. If hands are not visibly dirty, hand rub with at least 60% alcohol content can be used against coronaviruses as an alternative to cleaning hands when soap and water are not available. To use, rub hands together until they feel dry, or for approximately 20 seconds.\n\nIf soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub are unavailable or infeasible, handwashing with 0.05% chlorine solution can be considered as a temporary option. New chlorine solution should be made each day using the below instructions. Unused chlorine solution should be safely discarded at the end of each day in a latrine or toilet/drain connected to a septic system or sewer. Users should exercise caution to avoid getting the chlorine solution in their eyes or mouth.\n\nTo mix a chlorine handwashing solution using liquid bleach, use the percentage found on the bleach bottle (for example, 5%) and follow these instructions:\n\n[% chlorine in liquid bleach \u2215 % chlorine desired] \u2212 1 = Total parts of water for each part bleach\n\nExample of making 0.05% chlorine solution with 5% liquid bleach:\n\n[5% chlorine in liquid bleach / 0.05% chlorine desired] \u2013 1 = [5 / 0.05] \u2013 1\n\n= 99 parts of water for each 1 part liquid bleach\n\nIf you are using a 20 L container to mix the solution, you need 200 mL of liquid bleach and should fill the rest of the container with water.\n\n20 L / 100 parts = 0.2 L, or 200 mL per part aAn improved drinking water sourceexternal icon is a source that, by nature of its construction, adequately protects the source from outside contamination and may include piped household water connections, public standpipes, boreholes, protected dug wells, protected springs, and rainwater.\n\nb\u201cSoapy water\u201d is a mix of water and either powdered soap (such as laundry powder or detergent) or liquid soap. To prepare, mix enough soap with water so that you can create a lather when rubbing hands together. You can use soapy water like liquid soap, being sure that there is plain water for rinsing. As detailed above, the cleanest water available should be used for soapy water and rinse water. Instructions for making soapy water can be found in this documentexternal icon.\n\nAdministrative and engineering controls: Possibilities for markets\nEnsure widespread access to hand hygiene facilities by placing hand hygiene stations (handwashing stations or alcohol-based hand rub dispensers) at entrances, exits, and throughout the market, including within 5 meters of toilets if any are present at the market. Hand hygiene can be made obligatory upon entry and exit of the market. Hand hygiene stations should be obviously placed so that they are hard to avoid. Vendors and customers should have easy access to handwashing facilities (ideally one per vendor or group of vendors, depending on the layout).\nIn particular, handwashing stations should: 1) Allow users to scrub their hands under a stream of running water; 2) Secure provided soap (either a cage, rope, or other device); 3) Have a place to catch used water; 4) Provide single-use hand drying materials whenever possible; 5) Provide a waste bin to collect single-use hand drying materials (when applicable). More information on different handwashing station designs is available hereexternal icon.\nThe installation, supervision, and regular refilling should be the responsibility of local public health authorities but can be delegated to building / market managers.2\nIf using 0.05% chlorine solution, provide those doing the mixing with personal protective equipment (rubber gloves, thick aprons, and closed shoes, as well as masks and eye protection, if available).\nMaterials, activities, and personnel needed for implementation\nHandwashing stations or alcohol-based hand rub dispensers.\nDaily access to water (or alcohol-based hand rub) to refill hand hygiene stations and a consistent supply of soap.\nMarket staff to check on hand hygiene stations regularly and refill when necessary.\nMarket staff to enforce hand hygiene practice upon entry and exit to the market.\nSigns and/or audio messages in formats and languages suitable for local audiences within the market prompting customers to practice hand hygiene. Messaging should include information about when to practice hand hygiene as well as how.\nPersonal protective equipment (rubber gloves, thick aprons, and closed shoes) if using 0.05% chlorine solution.\nLocked location for storing handwashing stations or alcohol-based hand rub dispensers overnight.\nConsiderations and challenges for implementation\nContinuous oversight will be required to ensure that hand hygiene stations are refilled regularly, which may be difficult without clear management structures.\n\nIf water supply is not available on site, it will be more challenging and costly to regularly refill handwashing stations.\n\nThere will be costs associated with purchasing the handwashing stations or alcohol-based hand rub dispensers, refilling water and soap (or rub), personal protective equipment (if needed), developing and printing communications materials, and possibly paying staff to refill and reinforce use of hand hygiene stations upon entry and exit.\n\nThere could be supply chain constraints on soap and alcohol-based hand rub if demand increases as COVID-19 spreads. Single-use hand drying materials (such as paper towels) are often unavailable.\n\nIf using 0.05% chlorine solution, those mixing the solution should be adequately protected by wearing rubber gloves, thick aprons, and closed shoes during the mixing process because of potential skin, eye, and inhalation hazards. They should also be trained on how to mix chlorine solution.\n\nIf no rubber gloves are available, other non-permeable gloves can be substituted. Those mixing should remove gloves and wash hands immediately after mixing. If no aprons are available, cleaning personnel can wear protective clothing (such as long pants and long-sleeved shirts) and launder after use. Cleaning and Disinfection\nPersonal controls: General recommendations for cleaning and disinfection in markets\nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces at least once a day.3 In many market settings, the only surfaces that customers touch include the items that they are purchasing, cash, and any shared utensils, cups, or plates for food and beverages sold in markets. It is also possible that surfaces that are porous and therefore difficult to disinfect, such as wood tables, are touched frequently, but this will be different in every market and will need to be left up to the market administrator to assess. Railings, door handles, shopping carts, and sanitation (restroom/toilet/latrine) surfaces are other examples of frequently touched surfaces.\n\nCleaning refers to the removal of germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. It does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection. Removing dirt and impurities also helps disinfectant be more effective.\n\nDisinfecting refers to using chemicals, for example, sodium hypochlorite (bleach), to kill germs on surfaces. This process does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs, but by killing germs on a surface after cleaning, it can further lower the risk of spreading infection.\n\nIn market settings, use a 0.1% chlorine solution made from bleach, Calcium Hypochlorite (HTH), or bleaching powder and water (using non-turbid water source) for disinfection. Instructions for using HTH powder or bleaching powder can be found here.\n\nTo mix a chlorine solution using liquid bleach, use the percentage found on the bleach bottle (for example, 5%) and follow these instructions:4\n\n[% chlorine in liquid bleach \u2215 % chlorine desired] \u2212 1 = Total parts of water for each part bleach\n\nExample of making 0.1% chlorine solution with 5% liquid bleach:\n\n[5% chlorine in liquid bleach / 0.1% chlorine desired] \u2013 1 = [5 / 0.1] \u2013 1\n\n= 49 parts of water for each 1 part liquid bleach (50 parts total)\n\nIf you are using a 20 L jerry can to mix the solution, you need 400 mL of liquid bleach and should fill the rest of the jerry can with water.\n\n20 L / 50 parts = 0.4 L or 400 mL per part\n\nFurther instructions are available herepdf icon.\n\nCleaning and disinfection procedures:4\nPut on personal protective equipment (rubber gloves, thick aprons, and closed shoes, as well as masks and eye protection if available).\nMix 0.1% chlorine solution using the procedures described above in well-ventilated area.\nClean with detergent or soap and water to remove organic matter.\nApply the 0.1% chlorine solution to the surface with a cloth and allow for a contact time (the amount of time that the disinfectant should remain wet and undisturbed on the surface) of at least 1 minute. Additional disinfectant may need to be applied to ensure it remains wet for 1 minute. After 1 minute has passed, rinse residue with clean water (this will also protect the surface or item from damage).\nAfter cleaning and disinfection, carefully remove personal protective equipment (PPE) and wash hands immediately. Re-usable PPE (e.g. aprons) should be laundered immediately.\nCleaning and disinfecting should not take place near children or people with asthma.\n\nProcedures for various surfaces (hard surfaces, soft surfaces, electronics, and laundry) can be found here.\n\nAdministrative and engineering controls: Possibilities for markets\nMarket administrators should designate set \u2018cleaning personnel\u2019 (chosen vendors, cleaning staff, or other staff) to carry out cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces once a day, or more frequently if possible. This can take place either before the market opens or after it closes, whichever makes the most sense based on the context.\nMarket administrators and designated cleaning personnel should walk through the market together and decide which surfaces are touched frequently by customers and vendors and therefore should be the target of cleaning and disinfection efforts.\nProvide the market\u2019s designated cleaning personnel with cleaning supplies (soap/detergent, bleach, buckets) and personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear when mixing, cleaning, and disinfecting (rubber gloves, thick aprons, and closed shoes). PPE used for cleaning and disinfecting the market should be stored at the market in a secure, designated area. Cleaning personnel should not bring the PPE home.\nProvide those who typically clean (vendors, cleaning personnel, or other staff) with information (e.g. written or pictorial instructions) about when and how to clean and disinfect and how to safely prepare disinfectant solutions, as described in the leftmost column.\nMaterials, activities, and personnel needed for implementation\nStocks of soap, bleach, buckets, and other cleaning supplies (e.g. mops, rags).\nPersonal protective equipment for designated cleaning personnel (rubber gloves, thick aprons, safety glasses/face shields if available, and closed shoes).\nSufficient access to non-turbid water to meet all cleaning and disinfection needs.\nCommunications materials describing the cleaning and disinfection process, including proper mixing of solutions, for use by designated cleaning personnel.\nConsiderations and challenges for implementation\nThere will be costs associated with purchasing the bleach, soap, cleaning supplies, and personal protective equipment; printing communications materials; and possibly having to pay additional staff to clean.\n\nIf no rubber gloves are available for cleaning personnel, other non-permeable gloves can be used. If no aprons are available, cleaning personnel can wear protective clothing (such as long pants and long-sleeved shirts) and launder after use.\n\nThere could be further supply chain constraints on soap and chlorine products and PPE as demand increases as COVID-19 spreads.\n\nIf water supply is not available on site, it will be more challenging and costly to clean and disinfect daily.\n\nThere is potential for harm to users when using disinfection products, so it is important for cleaning personnel to be adequately protected in the mixing and disinfection process and trained on how to mix and disinfect.\n\nNote: Large-scale spraying of disinfectant in public places, including markets, is not recommended. There is limited evidence that it is effective. To be effective, disinfectants need to have sufficient contact time and coverage, which is difficult to get when doing large-scale spraying. There is also limited ability to control spray-related inhalation hazards by nearby people. Additionally, organic matter such as dirt or trash would need to be picked up/removed before disinfectants would work.4 Respiratory Hygiene\nPersonal controls: General recommendations for respiratory hygiene in markets\nIndividuals should cover coughs and sneezespdf icon with their elbow or a disposable tissue and clean hands immediately.\n\nIn areas where there is any level of known community transmission, all individuals, including those who lack symptoms, should wear masks when in public settings where other physical distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Individuals should wear masks correctly and make sure they are made from appropriate materialsexternal icon. Masks should not be worn by some individuals with physical, mental, emotional or behavioral issues, children under 2 years, or anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious or incapacitated.\n\nAdministrative and engineering controls: Possibilities for markets\nMarket administrators can make it compulsory for vendors and customers to wear masks while at the market, aside from those individuals who should not wear masks.\nUse of masks can be enforced by the market staff member who is making sure customers practice hand hygiene and informing them about physical distancing measures.\nIn closed markets, open doors and windows as much as possible to increase air flow. If available, fans can help increase air flow. However, steps should be taken to minimize fans blowing from one person directly to another person to reduce the potential spread of respiratory droplets or aerosols.\nMaterials, activities, and personnel needed for implementation\nSigns and/or audio messages in formats and languages suitable for local audiences within the market to remind people to wear masks, explain why they are wearing masks (to protect others), and remind them to cover their coughs and sneezes.\nCommunication campaigns (via radio, newspaper, social media, WhatsApp, or other platforms) so that customers and vendors are aware of the new procedures and know to bring masks with them when they go to the market.\nConsiderations and challenges for implementation\nThis is a relatively low-cost measure and should be straightforward to implement, especially if masks are encouraged for use in other public settings, but there will still be costs associated with developing and printing communications materials.",

However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water. HVAC, ventilation, and filtration\nVentilation and filtration provided by heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems can reduce the airborne concentration of the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), which can reduce the risk of transmission through the air.\n\nCheck to be sure your HVAC filter is correctly in place and consider upgrading the filter to the highest-rated filter that your system can accommodate (consult your HVAC manual or an HVAC professional for details).\nHVAC systems only filter the air when the fan is running, so run the system fan for longer times, or continuously.  Many systems can be set to run the fan even when no heating or cooling is taking place.\nWhen used properly, air purifiers can help reduce airborne contaminants, including viruses, in a home or confined space.\nImprove ventilation with outside air to improve indoor air quality:\nOpen the windows, or screened doors, if possible.\nOperate a window air conditioner that has an outdoor air intake or vent, with the vent open.\nOpen the outside air intake of the HVAC system, if yours has one (this is not common).\nOperate a bathroom fan when the bathroom is in use or continuously, if possible.\nAvoid these actions when outdoor air pollution is high or when it makes your home too cold, hot, or humid.\nCare should be taken with portable ventilation equipment, for example, fans, to minimize air blowing from one person directly at another person to reduce the potential spread of any airborne or aerosolized viruses.\nRunning your HVAC system, using an air purifier or a portable air cleaner, and increasing ventilation are not enough to protect yourself and your family from COVID-19. Continue to follow other prevention guidelines.\nUse of ozone generators in occupied spaces is not recommended. When used at concentrations that do not exceed public health standards, ozone applied to indoor air does not effectively remove viruses, bacteria, mold, or other biological pollutants.\nWhen someone is sick Bedroom and bathroom  Keep separate bedroom and bathroom for a person who is sick (if possible).\n\nThe person who is sick should stay separated from other people in the home (as much as possible).\nIf you have a separate bedroom and bathroom: Wear disposable gloves and only clean the area around the person who is sick when needed, such as when the area is soiled. This will help limit your contact with the person who is sick.\nCaregivers can provide personal cleaning supplies to the person who is sick (if appropriate). Supplies include tissues, paper towels, cleaners, and EPA-registered disinfectantsexternal icon. If they feel up to it, the person who is sick can clean their own space.\nIf shared bathroom: The person who is sick should clean and disinfect after each use. If this is not possible, the caregiver should wait as long as possible before cleaning and disinfecting.\nSee precautions for household members and caregivers for more information.\nFood\nStay separated: The person who is sick should eat (or be fed) in their room if possible.\nWash dishes and utensils using disposable gloves and hot water: Handle any used dishes, cups/glasses, or silverware with gloves. Wash them with soap and hot water or in a dishwasher.\nClean hands after taking off gloves or handling used items.\nTrash Dedicated, lined trash can: If possible, dedicate a lined trash can for the person who is sick. Use disposable gloves when removing garbage bags, and handling and disposing of trash. Wash hands afterwards.",

Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.\n\nYou can get COVID-19 during your travels. You may feel well and not have any symptoms, but you can still spread COVID-19 to others. You and your travel companions (including children) may spread COVID-19 to other people including your family, friends, and community for 14 days after you were exposed to the virus.\n\nDon\u2019t travel if you are sick or if you have been around someone with COVID-19 in the past 14 days. Don\u2019t travel with someone who is sick.\n\nBefore You Travel\nBefore you travel, consider the following:\n\nIs COVID-19 spreading at your destination?\nThe more cases at your destination, the more likely you are to get infected during travel and spread the virus to others when you return.\nCheck Each State\u2019s Cases in the Last 7 Days\nTravel Recommendations for Destinations Around the World\nDo you live with someone who might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19?\nIf you get infected while traveling, you can spread the virus to loved ones when you return, even if you don\u2019t have symptoms.\nAre you at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19?\nAnyone can get very ill from the virus that causes COVID-19, but older adults and people of any age with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.\nDoes your destination have requirements or restrictions for travelers?\nSome state, local, and territorial governments have requirements, such as requiring people to wear masks and requiring those who recently traveled to stay home for up to 14 days. Check state, territorial, tribal and local public health websites for information before you travel. If you are traveling internationally, check the destination\u2019s Office of Foreign Affairs or Ministry of Health or the US Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Country Information pageexternal icon for details about entry requirements and restrictions for arriving travelers, such as mandatory testing or quarantine.\nIf You Travel\nDuring your trip, take steps to protect yourself and others from COVID-19:\n\nWear a mask to keep your nose and mouth covered when in public settings.\nAvoid close contact by staying at least 6 feet apart (about 2 arms\u2019 length) from anyone who is not from your household.\nWash your hands often or use hand sanitizer (with at least 60% alcohol).\nAvoid contact with anyone who is sick.\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.\nTraveling Abroad? Check CDC\u2019s COVID-19 Travel Recommendations by Destination before planning your trip.\n\nConsiderations for Types of Travel\nTravel increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19. Your chances of getting COVID-19 while traveling also depend on whether you and those around you take steps to protect yourself and others, such as wearing masks and staying 6 feet away from people outside your household (social distancing). Airports, bus stations, train stations, and rest stops are all places travelers can be exposed to the virus in the air and on surfaces. These are also places where it can be hard to social distance. In general, the longer you are around a person with COVID-19, the more likely you are to get infected.\n\nAir travel\n\nAir travel requires spending time in security lines and airport terminals, which can bring you in close contact with other people and frequently touched surfaces. Most viruses and other germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes. However, social distancing is difficult on crowded flights, and sitting within 6 feet of others, sometimes for hours, may increase your risk of getting COVID-19.\n\nAlso consider how you get to and from the airport, as public transportation and ridesharing can increase your chances of being exposed to the virus.\n\nBus or train travel\n\nTraveling on buses and trains for any length of time can involve sitting or standing within 6 feet of others, which may increase your risk of getting COVID-19. If you choose to travel by bus or train, learn what you can do to protect yourself on public transportation.\n\nCar travel\n\nMaking stops along the way for gas, food, or bathroom breaks can put you and your traveling companions in close contact with other people and frequently-touched surfaces.\n\nRV travel\n\nYou may have to stop less often for food or bathroom breaks, but RV travel usually means staying at RV parks overnight and getting gas and supplies at other public places. These stops may put you and those with you in the RV in close contact with others.\n\nLearn more about how to protect yourself from COVID-19 on different types of transportation\n\nKnow When to Delay your Travel to Avoid Spreading COVID-19\nPeople who are sick, have recently tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, or have been exposed to a person with COVID-19 should delay travel. Learn when and for how long to delay travel to avoid spreading COVID-19.\n\nHow Are Companies Protecting Customers from COVID-19?\nWhen planning travel, you may want to check companies\u2019 websites to see what they are doing to protect customers from COVID-19. Things to look for include:\n\nRequiring people to wear a mask\nPromoting social distancing\nUsing online or contactless reservations and check-in\nUsing contactless payment\nEnhanced cleaning procedures\nTips to avoid getting and spreading COVID-19 in common travel situations:\nIn public:\nWear a mask in public settings.\nStay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms\u2019 length) from anyone who is not from your household.\nBathrooms and rest stops:\nWash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after using the bathroom and after you have been in a public place.\nIf soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.\nGetting gas:\nUse disinfecting wipes on handles and buttons at the gas pumps before you touch them (if available).\nAfter fueling, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. When you get to your destination, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\nHotels and accommodations:\nSee advice for traveling overnight.\nFood stops:\nThe safest option is to bring your own food. If you don\u2019t bring your own food, use drive-through, delivery, take-out, and curb-side pick-up options.\nAnticipate Your Travel Needs\nBring a mask to wear in public places.\nPack hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Keep this within reach.\nBring enough of your medicine to last you for the entire trip.\nPack food and water in case restaurants and stores are closed, or if drive-through, take-out, and outdoor-dining options aren\u2019t available.\nIf you are considering cleaning your travel lodgings, see CDC\u2019s guidance on how to clean and disinfect.\nCheck Travel Restrictions\nState, local, and territorial governments may have travel restrictions in place, including testing requirements, stay-at-home orders, and quarantine requirements upon arrival. Follow state, local, and territorial travel restrictions. For up-to-date information and travel guidance, check the state, territorial, tribal and local health department where you are, along your route, and where you are going. Prepare to be flexible during your trip as restrictions and policies may change during your travel.\n\nIf traveling internationally or across international borders, check with the destination\u2019s Office of Foreign Affairs or Ministry of Health or the US Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Country Information pageexternal icon for details about entry requirements and restrictions for arriving travelers, such as mandatory testing or quarantine. Local policies at your destination may require you to be tested for COVID-19 before you are allowed to enter the country. If you test positive on arrival, you may be required to isolate for a period of time. You may even be prevented from returning to the United States, as scheduled.\n\nAfter You Travel\nYou may have been exposed to COVID-19 on your travels. You may feel well and not have any symptoms, but you can be contagious without symptoms and spread the virus to others. You and your travel companions (including children) pose a risk to your family, friends, and community for 14 days after you were exposed to the virus. Regardless of where you traveled or what you did during your trip, take these actions to protect others from getting sick after you return:\n\nWhen around others, stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms\u2019 length) from other people who are not from your household. It is important to do this everywhere, both indoors and outdoors.\nWear a mask to keep your nose and mouth covered when you are outside of your home.\nWash your hands often or use hand sanitizer (with at least 60% alcohol).\nWatch your health and look for symptoms of COVID-19. Take your temperature if you feel sick.\nFollow state, territorial, tribal and local recommendations or requirements after travel.\n\nHigher Risk Activities\nSome types of travel and activities can put you at higher risk for exposure to COVID-19 (see list below).  If you participated in higher risk activities or think that you may have been exposed before or during your trip, take extra precautions (in addition the ones listed above) to protect others for 14 days after you arrive:\n\nStay home as much as possible.\nAvoid being around people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.\nConsider getting tested for COVID-19.\nWhat activities are considered higher risk?\n\nHere are examples of activities and situations that can increase your risk of exposure to COVID-19:\n\nBeing in an area that is experiencing high levels of COVID-19, including destinations with a Level 3 Travel Health Notice. You can check the Travel Health Notices for recommendations for places you have traveled, including foreign countries and U.S. territories.  You can also check states, counties, and cities to determine if these areas are experiencing high levels of COVID-19.\nGoing to a large social gathering like a wedding, funeral, or party.\nAttending a mass gathering like a sporting event, concert, or parade.\nBeing in crowds \u2014 for example, in restaurants, bars, airports, bus and train stations, or movie theaters.\nTraveling on a cruise ship or river boat.",

            "Text": "As restaurants and bars resume operations in some areas of the United States, CDC offers the following considerations for ways in which operators can protect employees, customers, and communities and slow the spread of COVID-19. Restaurants and bars can determine, in collaboration with state and local health officials, whether and how to implement these considerations, making adjustments to meet the needs and circumstances of the local community. Implementation should be guided by what is feasible, practical, acceptable, and tailored to the needs of each community. These considerations are meant to supplement\u2014not replace\u2014any state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which businesses must comply.\n\nGuiding Principles to Keep in Mind\nThe more an individual interacts with others, and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. The risk of COVID-19 spread increases in a restaurant or bar setting as follows:\n\nLowest Risk: Food service limited to drive-through, delivery, take-out, and curb-side pick up.\nMore Risk: Drive-through, delivery, take-out, and curb-side pick up emphasized. On-site dining limited to outdoor seating. Seating capacity reduced to allow tables to be spaced at least 6 feet apart.\nEven More Risk: On-site dining with both indoor and outdoor seating. Seating capacity reduced to allow tables to be spaced at least 6 feet apart.\nHighest Risk: On-site dining with both indoor and outdoor seating. Seating capacity not reduced and tables not spaced at least 6 feet apart.\nCOVID-19 is mostly spread by respiratory droplets released when people talk, cough, or sneeze. It is thought that the virus may spread to hands from a contaminated surface and then to the nose or mouth, causing infection. Therefore, personal prevention practices (such as handwashing, staying home when sick) and environmental cleaning and disinfection are important principles that are covered in this document. Fortunately, there are a number of actions operators of restaurants and bars can take to help lower the risk of COVID-19 exposure and spread.\n\nPromoting Behaviors that Reduce Spread\nRestaurants and bars may consider implementing several strategies to encourage behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19 among employees and customers.\n\nStaying Home when Appropriate\nEducate employees about when they should stay home and when they can return to work.\nActively encourage employees who are sick or have recently had a close contact with a person with COVID-19 to stay home. Develop policies that encourage sick employees to stay at home without fear of reprisal, and ensure employees are aware of these policies.\nEmployees should stay home if they have tested positive for or are showing COVID-19 symptoms.\nEmployees who have recently had a close contact with a person with COVID-19 should also stay home and monitor their health.\nCDC\u2019s criteria can help inform when employees they may return to work:\nIf they have been sick with COVID-19\nIf they have recently had a close contact with a person with COVID-19\nHand Hygiene and Respiratory Etiquette\nRequire frequent employee handwashing (e.g. before, during, and after preparing food; after touching garbage) with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and increase monitoring to ensure adherence.\nIn addition to any state or local requirements regarding glove use in restaurant operations, glove use is only recommended when removing garbage bags or handling and disposing of trash and when handling used or dirty food service items.\nEmployees should always wash their hands after removing gloves.\nEncourage employees to cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Used tissues should be thrown in the trash and hands washed immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\nIf soap and water are not readily available, use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.\nCloth Face Coverings\nRequire the use of cloth face coverings among all staff, as feasible. Face coverings are most essential in times when physical distancing is difficult. Information should be provided to staff on proper use, removal, and washing of cloth face coverings.\nNote: Cloth face coverings should not be placed on:\nBabies and children younger than 2 years old\nAnyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious\nAnyone who is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the cloth face covering without assistance\nCloth face coverings are meant to protect other people in case the wearer is unknowingly infected but does not have symptoms. Cloth face coverings are not surgical masks, respirators, or personal protective equipment.\nAdequate Supplies\nEnsure adequate supplies to support healthy hygiene behaviors. Supplies include soap, hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol (placed on every table, if supplies allow), paper towels, tissues, disinfectant wipes, cloth face coverings (as feasible), and no-touch/foot pedal trash cans.\nSigns and Messages\nPost signs in highly visible locations (e.g., at entrances, in restrooms) that promote everyday protective measurespdf iconpdf icon and describe how to stop the spreadpdf iconpdf icon of germs such as by properly washing hands and properly wearing a cloth face coveringimage iconimage icon.\nInclude messages (for example, videos) about behaviors that prevent spread of COVID-19 when communicating with vendors, staff, and customers (such as on business websites, in emails,  and on social media accounts).\nFind free CDC print and digital resources at the bars and restaurant page, as well as on CDC\u2019s communications resources main page.\nMaintaining Healthy Environments\nRestaurants and bars may consider several implementing strategies to maintain healthy environments.\n\nCleaning and Disinfection\nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (e.g., door handles, cash registers, workstations, sink handles, bathroom stalls) at least daily, or as much as possible and as required by food safety requirements. Clean shared objects (e.g., payment terminals, tables, countertops/bars, receipt trays, condiment holders) between each use.\nContinue to follow all required safety laws, regulations, and rules.\nUse products that meet EPA disinfection criteriaexternal icon and that are appropriate for the surface. Allow the disinfectant to remain on the surface for the contact time recommended by the manufacturer.\nEstablish a disinfection routine and train staff on proper cleaning timing and procedures to ensure safe and correct application of disinfectants.\nWash, rinse, and sanitize food contact surfaces with an EPA-approved food contact surface sanitizer. If a food-contact surface must be disinfected for a specific reason, such as a blood or bodily fluid cleanup or deep clean in the event of likely contamination with SARS-CoV-2, use the following procedure: wash, rinse, disinfectant according to the label instructions for the disinfectant, rinse, then sanitize with a food-contact surface sanitizer.\nEnsure that cleaning or disinfecting product residues are not left on table surfaces. Residues could cause allergic reactions or cause someone to ingest the chemicals.\nDevelop a schedule for increased, routine cleaning and disinfection.\nEnsure safe and correct use and storage of disinfectants to avoid food contamination and harm to employees and other individuals. This includes storing products securely away from children.\nUse gloves when removing garbage bags or handling and disposing of trash. Wash hands after removing gloves.\nShared Objects\nDiscourage sharing of items that are difficult to clean, sanitize, or disinfect.\nLimit any sharing of food, tools, equipment, or supplies by staff members.\nEnsure adequate supplies to minimize sharing of high-touch materials (e.g., serving spoons) to the extent possible; otherwise, limit use of supplies and equipment by one group of workers at a time and clean and disinfect between use.\nAvoid using or sharing items that are reusable, such as menus, condiments, and any other food containers. Instead, use disposable or digital menus, single serving condiments, and no-touch trash cans and doors.\nUse touchless payment options as much as possible, if available. Ask customers and employees to exchange cash or card payments by placing on a receipt tray or on the counter rather than by hand to avoid direct hand to hand contact. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as pens, counters, or hard surfaces between use and encourage patrons to use their own pens.\nUse disposable food service items (e.g., utensils, dishes, napkins, tablecloths). If disposable items are not feasible or desirable, ensure that all non-disposable food service items are handled with gloves and washed with dish soap and hot water, or in a dishwasher. Change and launder linen items (e.g., napkins and tablecloths) after each customer or party\u2019s use. Employees should wash their hands after removing their gloves or after handling used food service items.\nAvoid use of food and beverage utensils and containers brought in by customers.\nVentilation\nEnsure that ventilation systems operate properly and increase circulation of outdoor air as much as possible, for example by opening windows and doors and prioritizing outdoor seating. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk to customers or employees (e.g., risk of falling or triggering asthma symptoms).\nWater Systems\nTo minimize the risk of Legionnaires\u2019 disease and other diseases associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (e.g., sink faucets, decorative fountains, drinking fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown.\nModified Layouts and Procedures\nChange restaurant and bar layouts to ensure that all customer parties remain at least 6 feet apart (e.g., marking tables/stools that are not for use).\nLimit seating capacity to allow for social distancing.\nOffer drive-through, curbside take out, or delivery options as applicable. Prioritize outdoor seating as much as possible.\nAsk customers to wait in their cars or away from the establishment while waiting to pick up food or when waiting to be seated. Inform customers of food pickup and dining protocols on the business\u2019 website and on posted signs.\nDiscourage crowded waiting areas by using phone app, text technology, or signs to alert patrons when their table is ready. Avoid using \u201cbuzzers\u201d or other shared objects.\nConsider options for dine-in customers to order ahead of time to limit the amount of time spent in the establishment.\nAvoid offering any self-serve food or drink options, such as buffets, salad bars, and drink stations.\nPhysical Barriers and Guides\nInstall physical barriers, such as sneeze guards and partitions, particularly in areas where it is difficult for individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart. Barriers can be useful in restaurant kitchens and at cash registers, host stands, or food pickup areas where maintaining physical distance of at least 6 feet is difficult.\nProvide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signage, to ensure that individuals remain at least 6 feet apart. Consider providing these guides where lines form, in the kitchen, and at the bar.\nCommunal Spaces\nClose shared spaces such as break rooms, if possible; otherwise stagger use and clean and disinfect between use.\nMaintaining Healthy Operations\nRestaurants and bars may consider implementing several strategies to maintain healthy operations.\n\nProtections for Employees at Higher Risk for Severe Illness from COVID-19\nOffer options for employees at higher risk for severe illness (including older adults and people of all ages with certain underlying medical conditions) that limits their exposure risk (e.g., modified job responsibilities such as managing inventory rather than working as a cashier, or managing administrative needs through telework).\nConsistent with applicable law, develop policies to protect the privacy of persons at higher risk for severe illness in accordance with applicable privacy and confidentiality laws and regulations.\nRegulatory Awareness\nBe aware of local or state policies and recommendations related to group gatherings to determine if events can be held.\nStaggered or Rotated Shifts and Sittings\nRotate or stagger shifts to limit the number of employees in the restaurant or bar at the same time.\nStagger and limit dining times to minimize the number of customers in the establishment.\nWhen possible, use flexible worksites (e.g., telework) and flexible work hours (e.g., staggered shifts) to help establish policies and practices for social distancing (maintaining distance of approximately 6 feet) between employees and others, especially if social distancing is recommended by state and local health authorities.\nGatherings\nAvoid group events, gatherings, or meetings where social distancing of at least 6 feet between people cannot be maintained.\nTravel and Transit\nFor employees who commute to work using public transportation or ride sharing, encourage them to use transportation options that minimize close contact with others (e.g., walking or biking, driving or riding by car \u2013 alone or with household members only) or consider offering the following support:\nAsk employees to follow the CDC guidance on how to Protect Yourself When Using Transportation.\nAllow employees to shift their hours so they can commute during less busy times.\nAsk employees to wash their hands as soon as possible after their trip.\nDesignated COVID-19 Point of Contact\nDesignate a staff person for each shift to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns. All staff members should know who this person is and how to contact them..\nCommunication Systems\nPut systems in place for:\nConsistent with applicable law and privacy policies, having staff self-report to the establishment\u2019s point of contact if they have symptoms of COVID-19, a positive test for COVID-19, or were exposed to someone with COVID-19 within the last 14 days in accordance with health information sharing regulations for COVID-19external icon (e.g. see \u201cNotify Health Officials and Close Contacts\u201d in the Preparing for When Someone Gets Sick section below), and other applicable privacy and confidentiality laws and regulations.\nNotifying staff, customers, and the public of business closures, and restrictions in place to limit COVID-19 exposure (e.g., limited hours of operation).\nLeave (Time Off) Policies\nImplement flexible sick leave policies and practices that enable employees to stay home when they are sick, have been exposed, or caring for someone who is sick.\nExamine and revise policies for leave, telework, and employee compensation.\nLeave policies should be flexible and not punish people for taking time off and should allow sick employees to stay home and away from co-workers. Leave policies should also account for employees who need to stay home with their children if there are school or childcare closures, or to care for sick family members.\nDevelop policies for return-to-work after COVID-19 illness.  CDC\u2019s criteria to discontinue home isolation can inform these policies.\nBack-Up Staffing Plan\nMonitor absenteeism of employees, cross-train staff, and create a roster of trained back-up staff.\nStaff Training\nTrain all employees in safety actions.\nConduct training virtually, or ensure that social distancing is maintained during training.\nRecognize Signs and Symptoms\nConduct daily health checks (e.g., temperature screening and/or or symptom checking) of staff safely and respectfully, and in accordance with any applicable privacy laws and regulations.\nConsider using examples of screening methods in CDC\u2019s General Business FAQs as a guide.\nSupport Coping and Resilience \nPromote employees eating healthy, exercising, getting sleep, and finding time to unwind.\nEncourage employees to talk with people they trust about their concerns and how they are feeling.\nConsider posting signs for the national distress hotline: 1-800-985-5990, or text TalkWithUs to 66746\nPreparing for Sick Employees\nRestaurants and bars may consider implementing several strategies to prepare for when someone gets sick.\n\nAdvise Sick Employees of Home Isolation Criteria\nCommunicate to sick employees that they should not return to work until they have met CDC\u2019s criteria to discontinue home isolation.\nIsolate and Transport Those Who are Sick\nMake sure that employees know they should not come to work if they are sick, and they should notify their manager or other designated COVID-19 point of contact if they become sick with COVID-19 symptoms, test positive for COVID-19, or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 symptoms or a confirmed or suspected case.\nImmediately separate employees or customers with COVID-19 symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, shortness of breath). Individuals who are sick should go home or to a healthcare facility, depending on how sever their symptoms are, and follow CDC guidance for caring for oneself and others who are sick.\nClean and Disinfect\nClose off areas used by a sick person and do not use these areas until after cleaning and disinfecting them.\nWait at least 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible. Ensure safe and correct use and storage of cleaning and disinfection productsexternal icon, including storing them securely away from children.\nNotify Health Officials and Close Contacts\nIn accordance with state and local laws, restaurant and bar operators should notify local health officials and staff immediately of any case of COVID-19 among employees, while maintaining confidentiality in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)external icon.\nAdvise those who have had close contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19 to stay home and self-monitor for symptoms, and follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop.

Evaluate your workplace to identify scenarios where workers cannot maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet from each other and/or guests. Use appropriate combinations of controls following the hierarchy of controls to address these situations to limit the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. A committee of both workers and management may be most effective at identifying all possible scenarios.\n\nWhile protecting workers, it is important to note that control recommendations or interventions to reduce exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) must be compatible with any safety programs and personal protective equipment (PPE) normally required for the job task. Approaches to consider may include the following:\n\nCreate a COVID-19 Workplace Health and Safety Plan\n\nReview the CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers and the Resuming Business Toolkit for guidelines and recommendations that all employers can use to protect their employees.\n\nContinue to follow any state or local regulations for hotels in addition to the recommendations here.\nIdentify an on-site workplace coordinator who will be responsible for COVID-19 assessment and control.\nIn addition to work areas, identify other areas that may lead to close contact (within 6 feet for 15 minutes) among employees, for example break rooms, outside patios, parking garages, inside lounging areas, dining areas/kitchenspdf iconexternal icon, game rooms, pools, hot tubs, saunas, spas, salons, lobbies, fitness centers, laundry rooms, and routes of entry and exit.\nWhen developing plans, include all employees in the workplace, for example: staff, utility employees, maintenance, supervisory staff, hotel management, facilities staff, security staff, and housekeeping/janitorial staff, and outside contractors who may enter the facility.\nIf hotel guests or contractors enter the workspace, develop plans to communicate with them regarding modification to work or service processes.\nNotify all workers that any COVID-19 concerns should be directed to the identified coordinator.\nImplement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices.\nDevelop policies that encourage sick employees to stay at home without fear of reprisals, and ensure employees are aware of these policies.\nMaintain flexible policies that permit employees to stay home to care for a sick family member or take care of children due to school and childcare closures.\nIf contractors are employed in the workplace, develop plans to communicate with the contracting company regarding modifications to work processes.\nConsider conducting daily in-person or virtual health checks (e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening) of employees on scheduled workdays.\nScreening options could include having employees self-screen before arriving at work or taking employees\u2019 temperatures and assessing potential symptoms prior to beginning work (see CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers).\nMake sure employees can maintain at least 6 feet of distance while waiting for screening, if done on site.\nMake employee health screenings as private as possible and maintain the confidentiality of each individual\u2019s medical status and history.\nTake action if an employee is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19\n\nImmediately separate employees who report with or develop symptoms at work from other employees and arrange for private transport home. These employees should self-isolate and contact their health care provider immediately.\nClose off any areas that were used for prolonged periods of time by the sick person, if it is practical to do so.\nPerform enhanced cleaning and disinfection after anyone suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 has been in the workplace. Cleaning staff should clean and disinfect offices, bathrooms, common areas, and shared equipment used by the sick person, focusing especially on frequently touched surfaces or objects. If other workers do not have access to these areas or items, wait 24 hours (or as long as possible) before cleaning and disinfecting.\nEmployees who test positive for COVID-19 should immediately notify their employer of their results.\nSick employees should follow CDC recommended steps to self-isolate or seek care. Employees should not return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, in consultation with healthcare providers.\nA test-based strategy is not recommended to validate an employee\u2019s illness, or to qualify an employee for sick leave or return to work.\nDevelop hazard controls using the hierarchy of controls to prevent infection among workers. You may be able to include a combination of controls noted below.\n\nEngineering Controls (Isolate people from the hazards)\nAlter the workspace using engineering controls to prevent exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19.\nModify the alignment of workstations where feasible. For example, redesign workstations so workers are not facing each other.\nMove electronic payment terminals/credit card readers farther away from the reception desk to increase the distance between the guest and hotel staff.\nUpdate floor plans for lobbies, lounges, and restaurants, and redesign seating arrangements to ensure social distancing.\nEstablish, where possible, physical barriers between workers, and between workers and hotel guests.\nUse strip curtains, plastic barriers, or similar materials to create impermeable dividers or partitions.\nConsider installing transparent shields or other barriers where social distancing is not an option (e.g., reception desk).\nClose or limit access to common areas where employees are likely to congregate and interact, such as break rooms, parking lots, and in entrance/exit areas.\nRemove or space appropriately the chairs in the waiting area to discourage social gathering.\nConsider making foot-traffic single direction in narrow or confined areas, such as aisles and stairwells, to encourage single-file movement at a 6-foot distance.\nUse visual cues such as floor decals, colored tape, and signs to remind workers to maintain a distance of 6 feet from others, including at their workstation and in break areas.\nConsider these cues for guests and contractors as well, such as at the entrance or reception desk line.\nPlace handwashing stations or hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol in multiple locations throughout the workplace for workers and hotel guests.\nUse touch-free stations where possible.\nMake sure restrooms are well stocked with soap and a way for people to dry their hands.\nMake sure the workspace is well ventilatedexternal icon.\nWork with facilities management to adjust the ventilation so that the maximum amount of fresh air is delivered to occupied spaces while maintaining the humidity at 40-60%. If possible, increase filter efficiency of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) units to highest functional level.\nPortable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration units may be considered to remove contaminants in the air of poorly ventilated areas.\nAdditional considerations for improving the building ventilation system can be found in the CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers and COVID-19 Employer Information for Office Buildings.\nFollow guidance for reopening buildings after a prolonged shutdown or reduced operation to help protect employees and occupants from mold and Legionnaires\u2019 disease.\nAdministrative Controls (Change the way people work)\nProvide training and other administrative policies to prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.\nAll workers should have a basic understanding of COVID-19, how the disease is thought to spread, what the symptoms of the disease are, and what measures can be taken to prevent or minimize the transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19.\nTrainings should include the importance of social distancing (maintaining a distance of 6 feet or more when possible), wearing cloth masks appropriately, covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands, cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces, not sharing personal items or tools/equipment unless absolutely necessary, and not touching their face, mouth, nose, or eyes.\nWorkers should be encouraged to go home or stay home if they feel sick. Ensure that sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance, and that employees are aware of and understand these policies.\nConsider maintaining small groups of workers in teams (cohorting) to reduce the number of coworkers each person is exposed to.\nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.\nIf surfaces are dirty, clean them using a detergent or soap and water before you disinfect them.\nUse products that are EPA registered for use against SARS-CoV-2external icon, diluted household bleach solutions, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, appropriate for surface disinfection.\nProvide cleaning materials and conduct targeted and more frequent cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces (guest rooms, break rooms, public areas, fitness centers, and conference rooms, countertops, doorknobs, toilets, tables, light switches, phones, faucets, sinks, keyboards, etc.)\nInstruct guests to return room keys/key cards in a designated bin upon departure for later disinfection.\nProvide disposable disinfectant wipes to reception desk staff and parking lot/valet staff to disinfect surfaces in between guest interactions.\nUse devices that do not require the employee to handle guests\u2019 credit and debit cards and institute a cashless policy. If this is not possible, ensure that cash and/or cards are handled with care by employees either by changing gloves between each transaction or using hand sanitizer between customers.\nProvide employees adequate time and access to soap, clean water, and a way to dry their hands for handwashing.\nRemind employees to wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, they should use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.\nProvide hand sanitizer, tissues and no touch waste baskets at the cash registers and in the restrooms.\nPlace hand sanitizer stations throughout the hotel, especially in common areas and outside of elevator doors.\nProvide tissues and no touch waste baskets at the reception desk, in restrooms, the lobby, and in meeting rooms.\nMaintain social distancing in the hotel, including at reception desks.\nLimit the number of people in the hotel at one time. (Consult state and local guidance if available.)\nFor room service, consider taking measures to ensure contactless delivery.\nLimit party size in common areas such as lobbies and lounges to no more than the established guideline recommended by your local/state health departments.\nMinimize traffic in enclosed spaces, such as elevators and stairwells. Consider limiting the number of individuals in an elevator at one time and designating one-directional stairwells, if possible.\nConsider restricting occupancy or closing areas that may generate high traffic such as hotel offices, conference rooms, restaurants and bars, fitness centers/sporting courts, and pools/saunas.\nConsider suspending concierge services that require staff to directly handle guests\u2019 items. This includes guest services such as luggage delivery, laundry service, and valet parking.\nUse technological solutions where possible to reduce person-to-person interaction such as online reservation and check-in, mobile room key, mobile access to menus, and contactless payment options.\nHousekeeping staff should:\nWash hands or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer before entering and after exiting a guestroom.\nDiscard all single use items either provided by the hotel or left by the guest.\nConduct targeted cleaning and disinfecting of high-touch surfaces such as tables, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, remote controls, phones, toilets, toilet flush handles, sink faucets, door handles, pens, and irons.\nWear disposable gloves when handling trash.\nWash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds immediately after handling waste.\nIf a guest is ill and isolating in their hotel room, discontinue all but essential housekeeping services to the room.\nAdditional precautions should be taken for cleaning a room after a guest who has been ill has checked out of the hotel:\nDo not let anyone enter the room previously occupied by the ill guest.\nWait at least 24 hours before you enter the room. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible.\nIf possible, open outside doors and windows to increase air circulation as long as this does not create any additional safety hazards to staff or guests.\nThoroughly clean and disinfect the room, as stated above.\nCarpeted areas should be cleaned using a vacuum equipped with a HEPA filter, if available.\nOnce the room has been appropriately cleaned and disinfected, it can be opened for guest use.\nWash all hotel linens according to the manufacturer\u2019s label and dry on the highest setting possible. Allow items to dry completely before removing.\nStaff should wear disposable gloves when handling dirty laundry. Wash hands immediately after removing gloves.\nDo not shake dirty laundry.\nRemind employees that people may be able to spread the virus that causes COVID-19 even if they do not show symptoms. Consider all close interactions (within 6 feet) with employees, hotel guests, and others as a potential source of exposure.\nPost signs and reminders at entrances and in strategic places providing instruction on social distancing, hand hygiene, use of cloth masks, and cough and sneeze etiquette. Signs should be accessible for people with disabilities, easy to understand, and may include signs for non-English speakers, as needed.\nCommunication and training should be accessible for people with disabilities, easy to understand, in preferred language(s) spoken or read by the employees and include accurate and timely information.\nEmphasize use of images (infographics) that account for language differences.\nTraining should be reinforced with signs (preferably infographics), placed in strategic locations. CDC has free, simple posters available to download and print, some of which are translated into different languages.\nUse cloth masks.\nCloth masks are intended to protect other people\u2014not the wearer. They are not considered to be PPE.\nEmphasize that care must be taken when putting on and taking off cloth masks to ensure that the worker or the cloth mask does not become contaminated.\nCloth masks should be routinely laundered, if possible.\nEnsure cloth masks do not create a new risk (i.e. interfere with driving or vision, or contribute to heat-related illness) that exceeds their COVID-19 related benefits of slowing the spread of the virus. Cloth masks should also not be worn by anyone who has trouble breathing or is unable to remove it without assistance. CDC provides information on adaptations and alternatives that should be considered when cloth masks may not be feasible (e.g., people who are deaf or hard of hearing, have intellectual or developmental disabilities, or sensory sensitivities).\nEmployees should consider carrying a spare cloth mask.\nIf the cloth mask becomes wet, visibly soiled, or contaminated at work, it should be removed and stored to be laundered later.\nConsider requiring visitors to the workplace (service personnel, guests) to also wear cloth masks.\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE)\nPPE is the last step in the hierarchy of controls because it is more difficult to use effectively than other measures. To be protective and not introduce an additional hazard, the use of PPE requires characterization of the environment, knowledge of the hazard, training, and consistent correct use. This is why special emphasis is given to administrative and engineering controls when addressing occupational hazards, including when applying guidance to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIn the current COVID-19 pandemic, use of PPE such as surgical masks or N95 respirators is being prioritized for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance, unless they were required for your job before the pandemic.\n\nAdditional Cleaning Guidance for Housekeeping\nIn addition to the cleaning guidance above, employees cleaning guestrooms should:\n\nWash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before entering and after exiting a guestroom. Use hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol if soap and water aren\u2019t available.\nThrow away all single-use items provided by the hotel or left by the guest.\nClean frequently touched surfaces such as tables, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, remote controls, phones, toilets, toilet flush handles, sink faucets, door handles, pens, and irons.\nWash all hotel linens according to the manufacturer\u2019s label and use the warmest appropriate water setting. Allow items to dry completely.\nWear disposable gloves when handling dirty laundry or trash.\nDo not shake dirty laundry.\nWash hands immediately after handling dirty laundry or trash.\nIf a guest is ill and isolating in their hotel room, discontinue all but essential housekeeping services to the room.\nAdditional precautions for cleaning a room after a guest who has been ill has checked out of the hotel:\nClose off the room.\nWait 24 hours before you enter the room. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible.\nIf possible, open outside doors and windows to increase air circulation.\nThoroughly clean and disinfect the room, as stated above.\nUse a vacuum equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, if available.\nAfter the room has been appropriately disinfected, it can be opened for guest use.\nWash your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You don\u2019t need to wear gloves if you wash your hands regularly (unless they are already required for your job).\n\nUse hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol if soap and water aren\u2019t available.\nWash your hands at these key times:\nBefore, during, and after preparing food.\nBefore eating food.\nAfter using the toilet.\nAfter blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.\nAfter putting on, touching, or removing cloth masks.\nBefore and after work and work breaks.\nBefore and after cleaning guestrooms.\nDo not touch your face, mouth, nose, or eyes.\n\nCover your coughs and sneezes.\n\nUse tissues to cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.\nThrow used tissues in the trash.\nWash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\nHow You Can Help Your Staff and Others Cope with Stress\nMental health and emotional well-being are important components of worker safety and health. The COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges in the ways many people work and interact with others, which may lead to increased feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression. It is important to pay attention to these in yourself and your staff and encourage staff to take advantage of available resources for managing mental health issues.\n\nInformation and resources about mental health, recognizing signs of stress, taking steps to build resilience and manage stress, and knowing where to go if you, your staff, or others need help are available here.",

The assay provides a sensitive, nucleic-acid-based diagnostic tool for evaluation of specimens from patients in the acute phase of infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for this test on July 2, 2020.\n\nThe multiplex assay\u2019s FDA-authorized Instructions for Useexternal icon contains information about the test and its intended use, the test procedure, and the test performance characteristics. The FDA Letter of Authorizationexternal icon for the multiplex assay can be found on the EUA websiteexternal icon. The letter defines the authorized use and the conditions of authorization that apply to CDC and other testing laboratories that use this test.\n\nHow Public Health Laboratories Order the Flu SC2 Multiplex Assay\nThe International Reagent Resource (IRR)external icon is distributing the Flu SC2 Multiplex Assay and supplies to registered state and local public health laboratories so that they can perform testing with this assay.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, state public health laboratories can authorize county or city laboratories in their state to perform testing. These laboratories must be certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) to perform high-complexity tests, have appropriate laboratory equipment and training, and demonstrate testing proficiency under their state laboratory\u2019s stewardship to maintain their status as an IRR-registered laboratory. The IRR does not supply clinicians, hospitals, or healthcare professionals with testing kits directly. A list of commercially available primers and probes for use with this test is not available at this time. However, CDC has shared the primers and probes sequences, so other laboratories and companies may manufacture their own reagents.\n\nMaterials included in the assay The CDC Flu SC2 Multiplex Assay is a quadruplex assay that includes:\n\nOne primer mix and one probe mix. Primers and probes target:\nVirus nucleocapsid (N) gene for specific detection of SARS-CoV-2\nMatrix (M1) gene for specific detection of influenza A virus\nNonstructural 2 (NS2) gene for specific detection of influenza B virus\nRNase P gene (RP) for specific detection of human nucleic acid that serves as an internal control\nA positive control FluSC2PC that confirms all four targets in the assay are working correctly\nOther materials labs need to perform the assay\nThe Flu SC2 Multiplex Assay requires the use of additional authorized materials that are not included with the test. These materials include PCR reagents, equipment, and supplies commonly used in clinical laboratories such as a microcentrifuge, microcentrifuge tubes, pipettes, and pipette tips. They are described starting on page 5 in the authorized Flu SC2 Multiplex Assay Instructions for Useexternal icon. Two control materials are also required but not provided. These materials must produce expected results for a test to be considered valid, as outlined in the Flu SC2 Multiplex Assay Instructions for Use. The controls are the following:\n\nHuman specimen control (HSC): A human cell culture preparation used as an extraction procedural control to demonstrate successful recovery of nucleic acid, as well as extraction reagent integrity. Acceptable alternatives to HSC are listed in the Instructions for Use.\nNo template control (NTC): Nuclease-free water included in each run. This control monitors for reagent and system contamination.",

            "Text": "1. Background/Purpose\nThis document is intended for healthcare facilities that are receiving or are preparing to receive patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This includes healthcare facilities providing either inpatient or outpatient services.  It should be used to guide implementation of procedures at triage that can be effective at preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus) to patients and healthcare workers (HCWs). This document was developed based on current COVID-19 data and experience with other respiratory viruses and will be updated as more information becomes available.\n\n1.1 What is triage\n\u201cThe sorting out and classificationexternal icon of patientsexternal icon or casualties to determine priority of need and proper place of treatmentexternal icon.\u201d1   During infectious disease outbreaks, triage is particularly important to separate patients likely to be infected with the pathogen of concern.  This triage SOP is developed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and does not replace any routine clinical triage already in place in healthcare facilities (e.g. Manchester triage system or equivalent2) to categorize patients into different urgency categories.\n\n1.2 COVID-19 transmission\nThe main route of transmission of COVID-19 is through respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes.  Any person who is in close contact with someone who has respiratory symptoms (e.g., sneezing, coughing, etc.) is at risk of being exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets.3   Droplets may also land on surfaces where the virus could remain viable for several hours to days. Transmission can occur from hands contacting contaminated surfaces and then coming into contact with the person\u2019s mucosa such as nose, mouth and eyes.\n\n2. What patients can do before and upon arrival to a healthcare facility\nInform healthcare providers if they are seeking care for COVID-19 symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue, headache, shortness of breath, loss of smell or taste, sore throat or other 4 by calling ahead of time.\nWear a medical mask (e.g., surgical or procedure masks) and, if not available, wear a cloth or fabric mask during transport and while at triage in the healthcare facility.5\nNotify triage registration desk about symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 as soon as they arrive.\nWash hands at healthcare facility entrance with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub.\nCarry paper or fabric tissues to cover mouth or nose when coughing or sneezing. Dispose paper tissues in a trash can immediately after use.\nMaintain social distance by staying at least one meter away according to WHO guidance3, whenever possible, from anyone, including anyone that is with the patient (e.g., companion or caregiver).\n3. What healthcare facilities can do to minimize risk of infection among patients and healthcare workers\nCommunicate with patients before arriving for triage\nEstablish a hotline that:\nPatients can call or text notifying the facility that they are seeking care due to COVID-19 symptoms.\nCan be used, if possible, as telephone consultation for patients to determine the need to visit a healthcare facility.\nServes to inform patients of preventive measures to take as they come to the facility (e.g., wearing mask, having tissues to cover cough or sneeze).\nProvide information to the general public through local mass media such as radio, television, newspapers, and social media platforms about availability of a hotline and the signs and symptoms of COVID-19.\nHealthcare facilities, in conjunction with national authorities, should consider telemedicine (e.g., telephone, audio-video calls, or secure messaging) to provide clinical support without direct contact with the patient.6 However, patients with any emergency warning signs such as trouble breathing, new confusion, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, or inability to wake or stay awake should seek medical care immediately.\nSet up and equip triage\nLimit point of entry to the health facility.\nHave clear signs at the entrance of the facility directing patients with COVID-19 symptoms to immediately report to the registration desk in the emergency department or at the unit they are seeking care (e.g., maternity, pediatric, HIV clinic) (Appendix 1). Facilities should consider having a separate registration desk for patients coming in with COVID-19 symptoms, especially at the emergency departments, and clear signs at the entrance directing patients to the designated registration desk.\nEnsure availability of medical masks and paper tissue at registration desk, as well as nearby hand hygiene stations. A bin with lid should be available at triage where patients can discard used paper tissues.\nInstall physical barriers (e.g., glass or plastic screens) for registration desk (i.e., reception area) and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter to limit close contact between registration desk personnel and potentially infectious patients.\nEnsure availability of hand hygiene stations in triage area, including waiting areas.\nPost visual alerts at the entrance of the facility and in strategic areas (e.g., waiting areas or elevators) about respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette and social distancing. This includes how to cover nose and mouthpdf icon when coughing or sneezing and disposal of contaminated items in trash cans.\nAssign dedicated clinical staff (e.g. physicians or nurses) for physical evaluation of patients presenting with COVID-19 symptoms at triage. These staff should be trained on triage procedures, COVID-19 case definition, and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) use (i.e., mask, eye protection, gown and gloves).\nTrain administrative personnel working in the reception area on how to perform hand hygiene, maintain appropriate distance, and on how to advise patients on the proper use of medical masks, hand hygiene, and separation from other patients.\nA standardized triage algorithm/questionnaire should be available for use and should include questions that will determine if the patient meets the COVID-19 case definition4,7 (Appendix 2). Algorithms should be adjusted based on settings and epidemiologic considerations in each country. HCWs should be encouraged to have a high level of clinical suspicion of COVID-19 given the global pandemic.\nSet up a \u201crespiratory waiting area\u201d for suspected COVID-19 patients\nHealthcare facilities without enough single isolation rooms or those located in areas with high community transmission should designate a separate, well-ventilated area where patients at high risk* for COVID-19 can wait. This area should have benches, stalls or chairs separated by at least one-meter distance. The waiting areas should have dedicated toilets and hand hygiene stations. Patients who are suspected to have COVID-19 should not be mixed with COVID-19 confirmed patients in isolation areas.4\nPost clear signs informing patients of the location of waiting areas for suspected COVID-19. Train the registration desk staff to direct patients immediately to these areas after registration.\nProvide paper tissues, alcohol-based hand rub, and trash bins with lids for the separate COVID-19 waiting area.\nDevelop a process to reduce the amount of time patients are in the COVID-19 waiting area, which may include:\nAllocation of additional staff to triage patients suspected of COVID-19\nSetting up a notification system that allows patients to wait in a personal vehicle or outside of the facility (if medically appropriate) in a place where social distance can be maintained and they can be easily notified by phone or other remote methods when it is their turn to be evaluated.\nTriage process\nA medical mask should be given to patients with respiratory symptoms as soon as they get to the facility if they do not already have one. All patients in the separate COVID-19 waiting area should wear a medical mask.\nIf medical masks are not available, provide paper tissues or request the patient to cover their nose and mouth with a scarf, bandana, or T-shirt during the entire triage process, including while in the COVID-19 waiting area. A homemade cloth mask can also be used as source control, if the patient has one. Exercise caution as these items will become contaminated and can serve as a source of transmission to other patients or family members. WHO\u2019s guidance should be followed by patients and family members to clean these items. (https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-on-infection-prevention-and-control-for-health-care-workers-caring-for-patients-with-suspected-or-confirmed-2019-ncovexternal icon).\nUse a standardized triage algorithm (Appendix 2) to immediately isolate/separate patients at high risk* for having COVID-19 in single-person rooms with doors closed or designated COVID-19 waiting areas.\nLimit the number of accompanying family members in the waiting area for suspected COVID-19 patients (do not allow children aged <18 years unless a patient or a parent). Anyone in the separate waiting area for suspected COVID-19 should wear a medical mask. If medical mask is not available, wear a cloth mask or use multiple layers paper tissues or other fabrics such as T-shirts or scarfs to cover their nose and mouth.\nTriage area, including a separate waiting area for suspected COVID-19, should be cleaned at least twice a day with a focus on frequently touched surfaces. Disinfection can be done with 1% (1000ppm) chlorinepdf icon or 70% alcohol for surfaces that do not tolerate chlorine. For large blood and body fluid spills, 0.5% (5000ppm) chlorinepdf icon is recommended.8\n*defined as patients at high risk for having COVID-19 based on clinical and epidemiologic criteria (e.g., travel history or exposure to someone with confirmed or suspected COVID-19). Definition may change depending on where countries or regions within countries are in the stage of outbreak (e.g. no or limited vs. widespread community transmission). See Appendix 3 for the different epidemiologic scenarios. \n\n4. What healthcare workers (HCWs) can do to protect themselves and their patients during triage\nAll HCWs should adhere to Standard Precautions, which includes hand hygiene, selection of PPE based on risk assessment, respiratory hygiene, cleaning and disinfection and injection safety practices.\nAll HCWs should be trained on and familiar with infection prevention and control (IPC) precautions (e.g. contact and droplet precautions, appropriate hand hygiene, donning and doffing of PPE) related to COVID-19.\nFollow appropriate PPE donning and doffing steps.\nPerform frequent hand hygiene with an alcohol-based hand rub if your hands are not visibly dirty or with soap and water if hands are dirty.\nHCWs who come in contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients should wear appropriate PPE:\nHCWs in triage areas who are conducting preliminary screening do not require PPE if they DO NOT have direct contact with the patient and MAINTAIN distance of at least one meter. Examples:\nHCWs at the registration desk that are asking limited questions based on triage protocol. Installation of physical barriers (e.g., glass or plastic screens) are encouraged if possible.\nHCWs providing medical masks or taking temperatures with infrared thermometers as long as a distance of at least one meter can be safely maintained.\nWhen physical distance is NOT feasible and yet NO direct contact with patients occurs, use a medical mask and eye protection (face shield or goggles).\nHCWs conducing physical examination of patients with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 should wear gowns, gloves, a medical mask and eye protection (goggles or face shield).\nCleaners in triage, waiting and examination areas should wear a gown, heavy duty gloves, a medical mask, eye protection (if risk of splash from organic material or chemical), boots or closed work shoes.\nHCWs who develop symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath, loss of smell or taste, sore throat) should stay home and not perform triage or any other duties at the healthcare facility.\nEnsure that environmental cleaning and disinfection procedures are followed consistently and correctly (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/water-sanitation-hygiene-and-waste-management-for-covid-19external icon ).\n5. Additional considerations for triage during periods of community transmission\nBegin or reinforce existing alternatives to face-to-face triage and visits such as telemedicine.6\nDesignate an area near the facility (e.g., an ancillary building or temporary structure) or identify a location in the area to be a \u201cCOVID-19 evaluation center\u201d where patients with symptoms of COVID-19 can seek evaluation and care.\nExpand hours of operation, if possible, to limit crowding at triage during peak hours.\nCancel non-urgent outpatient visits to ensure enough HCWs are available to provide support for COVID-19 clinical care, including triage services. Critical or urgent outpatient visits (e.g. infant vaccination or prenatal checkup for high-risk pregnancy) should continue, however, facilities should ensure separate/dedicated entry for patients coming for critical outpatient visits to not place them at risk of COVID-19.\nConsider postponing or cancelling elective procedures and surgeries depending on the local epidemiologic context.",

            "Text": "Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance dialysis are at high risk for serious illness and death related to infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Most patients on maintenance dialysis undergo hemodialysis three times a week at outpatient dialysis centers. At each treatment, dialysis facilities should assess patients for symptoms consistent with COVID-19 or exposure to others with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nTesting for SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens can detect current infections (referred to here as viral testing) among patients in outpatient dialysis facilities. Viral testing of patients in outpatient dialysis facilities, with authorized nucleic acid or antigen detection assays, can be an important addition to other infection prevention and control (IPC) recommendations aimed at preventing SARS-CoV-2 from entering dialysis facilities, detecting cases quickly, and stopping transmission.  This guidance is based on currently available information about SARS-CoV-2 and will be refined and updated as more information becomes available.\n\nTesting conducted at dialysis facilities should be implemented in addition to recommended IPC measures. Not all dialysis facilities can perform on-site testing; however, all facilities should have a plan for testing patients for SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., identify where patients will be referred for testing if the dialysis facility cannot perform onsite testing).\n\nTesting practices (including performing tests and reporting results) should aim for rapid turnaround times (i.e., less than 48 hours) in order to facilitate effective interventions. Collecting a new specimen for a second test in the same patient more than once in a 24-hour period is generally not recommended unless the second test is being used to confirm an initial result (e.g., nucleic acid detection to confirm antigen test result).  Antibody (serologic) test results should not be used to diagnose an active SARS-CoV-2 infection or to inform IPC actions.\n\nWhile this guidance focuses on testing patients undergoing hemodialysis at outpatient hemodialysis facilities, several of the recommendations \u2013 such as testing patients with signs or symptoms of COVID-19 and testing asymptomatic close contacts \u2013 should also be applied to ESRD patients undergoing home dialysis (i.e., home hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis).\n\nCMS has suggested that routine testing could be considered for nursing home residents who regularly leave the facility including for dialysis. Centers who dialyze these patients should have a plan to address residents who are found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, including working to establish lines of communication so that results of resident testing are rapidly communicated and acted on.\n\nFor additional guidance addressing other non-healthcare settings, refer to the CDC guidance addressing Communities, Schools, Workplaces and Events. Guidance for testing healthcare personnel (HCP) is available in the Interim Guidance on Testing Healthcare Personnel for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nTesting patients with signs or symptoms of COVID-19\nEvery time a patient presents to the facility for a dialysis treatment, evaluate for any COVID-19 symptoms. Perform viral testing of any patient who has signs or symptoms of COVID-19.\nClinicians should use professional judgment to determine if a patient has signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested. Individuals with ESRD and COVID-19 may not show common symptoms such as fever or respiratory symptoms.  Some patients might present with only mild symptoms or other less common symptoms. Even mild signs and symptoms (e.g., sore throat) of a possible SARS-CoV-2 infection should prompt consideration for testing\nClinicians are encouraged to consider testing for other causes of respiratory illness, such as influenza, in addition to testing for SARS-CoV-2.\nPatients should be cared for by HCP using all personal protective equipment (PPE) and precautions described for patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection while waiting for results of the test to return.\nTesting asymptomatic patients with known or suspected exposure to an individual infected with SARS-CoV-2, including close and expanded contacts (e.g., there is an outbreak in the facility) to control transmission\nEvery time a patient presents to the facility assess for any recent exposure to others with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nPatients undergoing outpatient dialysis might have exposures to individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection inside and outside of the dialysis facility. It is important that patients are screened for any potential exposures each time they undergo treatment so IPC measures can be promptly implemented and testing can be performed in an expeditious manner to prevent transmission to other patients or HCP.\nBecause of the potential for asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection to other vulnerable individuals and HCP in the dialysis facility, it is important that dialysis patients that have been close contacts of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection be quickly identified and tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nFacilities should maintain at least 6 feet of separation between patients who had close contact with a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection and other patients during dialysis treatment; they should not be cohorted with each other or with patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. HCP caring for patients who were close contacts of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection should use all recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) for the care of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nBecause patients can develop SARS-CoV-2 infection at any point during their 14-day exposure period, such safeguards should remain in place for 14 days after the exposure event, even if viral testing of the exposed patient is negative during this time period.\nIf the exposed patient is within 90 days of being diagnosed with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, has completed their recommended duration of isolation precautions, and is currently asymptomatic, they do not need to be tested or managed with Transmission-Based Precautions.  However, if these individuals develop new symptoms consistent with COVID-19 they should be placed on Transmission-Based Precautions, assessed, and potentially tested for SARS-CoV-2 if an alternate etiology is not identified.\nFollow local regulations regarding reporting newly identified infections to public health authorities.\nIf there is an outbreak in the facility (i.e., evidence of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the dialysis facility or multiple patients or HCP with recent-onset SARS-CoV-2 infection), consider performing expanded viral testing of all patients and HCP in the dialysis facility or all patients and HCP that had dialysis treatments or worked on the same shift or day (i.e., expanded contacts beyond close contacts)\nSince patients can develop a SARS-CoV-2 infection due to exposure outside of the dialysis facility, identifying transmission within a dialysis facility can be challenging. SARS-CoV-2 infections among healthcare personnel (HCP) or patients with epidemiologic links within the dialysis facility and no other identified exposures suggest that transmission may have occurred within the dialysis facility. Transmission within a dialysis facility should be considered an outbreak, and the health department should be notified.\nPerforming viral testing of all patients, as soon as transmission within the facility is suspected, will allow for identification of infected patients quickly, assisting in their clinical management and allowing rapid implementation of IPC interventions (e.g., isolation, cohorting, use of PPE) to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission.\nFollow up testing (e.g., every 3 to 7 days) should be considered if additional SARS-CoV-2 infections are identified in the initial round of testing.\nFacility-wide viral testing might identify asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection; facility leadership should be prepared to continue to provide dialysis and isolate patients as needed.\nTesting of HCP should also be included as part of the response to the outbreak. For additional details see the Interim Guidance on Testing Healthcare Personnel for SARS-CoV-2.\nIf viral testing capacity is limited, additional considerations can be used to direct testing.\nFor example, if cases are identified in patients on a particular dialysis schedule or shift (e.g., Monday/Wednesday/Friday), testing could be performed in all patients on that schedule instead of facility wide.\nFor considerations on performing expanded testing, See Performing Broad-Based Testing for SARS-CoV-2 in Congregate Settings, which can be adapted to dialysis settings.\nNotify local public health authorities of suspected or confirmed outbreaks in the dialysis facility.\nTesting to determine resolution of infection\nIn general, a symptom-based strategy should be used to guide the decision on when to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions because, in most cases, the test-based strategy results in prolonged isolation of patients who continue to shed detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA but are no longer infectious. A test-based strategy could be considered for some patients (e.g., those who are severely immunocompromised) in consultation with local infectious diseases experts if concerns exist for the patient being infectious for more than 10 to 20 days. In all other circumstances, the symptom-based strategy should be used to determine when to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions.",

            "Text": "Considerations for schools\nAs communities in the United States consider how to safely re-open K-12 school buildings and in-person services, CDC offers updated considerations for mitigation strategies that K-12 school administrators can use to help protect students, teachers, and staff and slow the spread of COVID-19.  These updated Considerations for Schools are intended to aid school administrators as they consider how to protect the health, safety, and wellbeing of students, teachers, staff, their families, and communities:\n\nPromoting behaviors that reduce COVID-19\u2019s spread\nMaintaining healthy environments\nMaintaining healthy operations\nPreparing for when someone gets sick\nSchools should determine, in collaboration with state and local health officials to the extent possible, whether and how to implement each of these considerations while adjusting to meet the unique needs and circumstances of the local community. Implementation should be guided by what is feasible, practical, acceptable, and tailored to the needs of each community. It is also critically important to develop strategies that can be revised and adapted depending on the level of viral transmission in the school and throughout the community and done with close communication with state and/or local public health authorities and recognizing the differences between school districts, including urban, suburban, and rural districts. These considerations are meant to supplement\u2014not replace\u2014any Federal, state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which schools must comply (e.g., Individuals with Disabilities Education Actexternal icon).\n\nSchool-based health facilities may refer to CDC\u2019s Guidance for U.S. Healthcare Facilities and may find it helpful to reference the Ten Ways Healthcare Systems Can Operate Effectively During the COVID-19 Pandemic.\n\nMore information for schools\nAfter reviewing the suggestions listed on this page, school administrators can use CDC\u2019s School Considerations: Readiness and Action Planning Toolpdf icon to protect students, staff and communities.\n\nSchool-based health facilities may refer to CDC\u2019s Guidance for U.S. Healthcare Facilities and may find it helpful to reference the Ten Ways Healthcare Systems Can Operate Effectively During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Guiding principles to keep in mind\nEveryone\u2019s goal is to prioritize the reopening of schools as safely and as quickly as possible given the many known and established benefits of in-person learning. In order to enable this and assist schools with their day-to-day operations, it is important to adopt and diligently implement actions to slow the spread of COVID-19 inside the school and out in the community. Vigilance to these actions will moderate the risk of in-school transmission regardless of the underlying community burden \u2013 with risk being the lowest if community transmission is low and there is fidelity to implementing proven mitigation strategies.\n\nThe statement The Importance of Reopening America\u2019s Schools this Fall highlights that parents and school leaders are very eager for schools to reopen, but understandably concerned about the health and safety of their children during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nChildren and COVID-19\nIn general, children with COVID-19 are less likely to have severe symptoms than adults or experience an asymptomatic infection \u2013 meaning they do not have any signs or symptoms of disease (1-7).\n\nAnalysis of pediatric COVID-19 hospitalization data from 14 states from early March to late July 2020 found the cumulative rate of COVID-19\u2013associated hospitalization among children was over 20 times lower compared to adults (8.0 versus 164.5 per 100,000 population) (8). Although the cumulative rate is low, one in three children hospitalized with COVID-19 was admitted to an intensive care unit so the risk is not negligible (8). Similarly, the death rate among school-aged children is much lower than the rate among adults (9, 10). Also, the comparatively low risk for hospitalization and death among children themselves must be contextualized to the risk posed to teachers, school administrators, and other staff in the school environment. The risk of teachers, school administrators, and other staff in the school is expected to mirror that of other adults in the community if they contract COVID-19.\n\nTo be sure, the best available evidence from countries that have reopened schools indicates that COVID-19 poses low risks to school-aged children \u2013 at least in areas with low community transmission. That said, the body of evidence is growing that children of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (3-7) and, contrary to early reports (11, 12), might play a role in transmission (7, 13, 14).\n\nThe many benefits of in-person schooling should be weighed against the risks posed by COVID-19 spread. Of key significance, in-person learning is in the best interest of students, when compared to virtual learning. Application and adherence to mitigation measures provided in this document and similar to those implemented at essential workplaces can help schools reopen and stay open safely for in-person learning.\n\nDeciding how to reopen\nSchool officials should make decisions about school reopening based on available data including levels of community transmission and their capacity to implement appropriate mitigation measures in schools to protect students, teachers, administrators, and other staff. Schools should also consider other aspects of students\u2019 risk and wellbeing that arise when schools do not reopen for in-person classes. This includes the potential adverse impacts on students\u2019 social-emotional, behavioral, and mental health, as well as the critical services provided to students to help mitigate health disparities and serve children in need, such as school lunch programs, special education services, after-school programs and mental health services.\n\nThe unique and critical role that schools play makes them a priority for reopening and remaining open, enabling students to receive both academic instruction and enable the provision of other critical services and supports. By strictly implementing mitigation strategies, schools will be able to meet the needs of their students and community, while reducing the risk of COVID-19 spread. Taking actions to lower the risk of COVID-19 spread\nCOVID-19 is mostly spread by respiratory droplets released when people talk, cough, or sneeze. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own eyes, nose, or mouth. Therefore, personal prevention practices (such as handwashing, staying home when sick) and environmental cleaning and disinfection are important principles that are discussed below. Fortunately, there are a number of actions school administrators can take to help lower the risk of COVID-19 exposure and spread during school sessions and activities.\n\nIn order to reach the goal of reopening schools as safely and as quickly as possible for in-person learning, and help schools remain open, it is important to adopt and diligently implement actions to slow the spread of COVID-19 inside the school and out in the community.  This means that students, families, teachers, school staff, and all community members take actions to protect themselves and others where they live, work, learn, and play.\n\nContinuum of risk\nBy model of learning and implementation of proven mitigation strategies\nIn general, the risk of COVID-19 spread in schools increases across the continuum of virtual, hybrid, to in-person learning with the risk moderated for hybrid and in-person learning based upon the range of mitigation strategies put in place and the extent they are conscientiously followed.\n\nWhile not exhaustive, this stratification attempts to characterize the risks of spread among students, teachers, and staff across this continuum:\n\nLowest risk:\n\nStudents and teachers engage in virtual-only classes, activities, and events\nSome risk:\n\nHybrid Learning Model: Some students participate in virtual learning and other students participate in in-person learning\nSmall, in-person classes, activities, and events\nCohorting, alternating schedules, and staggered schedules are applied rigorously\nNo mixing of groups of students and teachers throughout/across school days\nStudents and teachers do not share objects\nStudents, teachers, and staff follow all steps to protect themselves and others at all times including proper use of face masks, social distancing, hand hygiene\nRegularly scheduled (i.e., at least daily or between uses) cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched areas implemented with fidelity\nMedium risk:\n\nHybrid Learning Model: Most students participate in in-person learning, some students participate in virtual learning\nLarger in-person classes, activities, and events\nCohorting, alternating schedules, and staggered schedules are applied with some exceptions\nSome mixing of groups of students and teachers throughout/across school days\nStudents and teachers minimally share objects\nStudents, teachers, and staff follow all steps to protect themselves and others such as proper use of face masks, social distancing, hand hygiene\nRegularly scheduled cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched areas largely implemented with fidelity\nHigher risk:\n\nStudents and teachers engage in in-person only learning, activities, and events\nStudents minimally mix between classes and activities\nStudents and teachers share some objects\nStudents, teachers, and staff follow some steps to protect themselves and others at all times such as proper use of face masks, social distancing, hand hygiene\nIrregular cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched areas\nHighest risk:\n\nStudents and teachers engage in in-person only learning, activities, and events\nStudents mix freely between classes and activities\nStudents and teachers freely share objects\nStudents, teachers, and staff do not/are not required to follow steps to protect themselves and others such as proper use of face masks, social distancing, hand hygiene\nIrregular cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched areas Plan and prepare\nEmergency operations plans: review, update, and implement EOPs\nThe most important actions for school administrators to take before reopening in-person services and facilities are planning and preparing. To best prepare, schools should expect that students, teachers, or staff may contract symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and schools must know what to do when this happens. Regardless of the number of cases in a community, every school should have a plan in place to protect staff, children, and their families from the spread of COVID-19 and a response plan in place for if/when a student, teacher, or staff member tests positive for COVID-19. This plan should be developed in collaboration with state and local public health departments; school nurses, parents, caregivers, and guardians; student leaders; community members; and other relevant partners. Schools should prioritize EOP components that address infectious disease outbreaks and their consequences.\n\nReference key resources on emergency preparedness while reviewing, updating, and implementing the EOP.\nMultiple federal agencies have developed resources on school planning principles and a 6-step processpdf iconexternal icon for creating plans to build and continually foster safe and healthy school communities before, during, and after possible emergencies.\nThe Readiness and Emergency Management for Schools (REMS) Technical Assistance Center\u2019s websiteexternal icon contains free resources, trainings, and technical assistance (TA) for schools and their community partners, including many tools and resources on emergency planning and response to infectious disease outbreaks. Schools may find these considerations are helpful for developing high-quality emergency operations plans.\nSchool nurses, teachers, staff, parents, student leaders, and other community stakeholders (e.g., youth service organizations, health centers, etc.) should be involved in the development of the Emergency Operations Plans (EOP). Some of the strategies school administrators should consider while developing their EOP:\n\nDevelop a protocol for monitoring local COVID-19 data in your community to keep track of the level of community transmission, to make decisions about changes to mitigation strategies, and to help determine whether school closures may be necessary. This should include daily review of official public health data for the community surrounding the school. Contact the state, local, tribal, or territorial Public Health Department for references to local COVID-19 data.\nDevelop and test information-sharing systems (e.g., school-to-parent email or texting protocols, periodic virtual meetings with parent/teachers, etc.) with school and community partners and key stakeholders. Use institutional information systems for day-to-day reporting on information that can help to detect and respond to an outbreak, such as number of cases and absenteeism or changes in the number of visits to the health center by students, teachers, and other staff.\nAdopt mitigation strategies to promote healthy behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19, maintain healthy school environments and operations, and plan what to do if a student, teacher, or staff member gets sick.\nExamine the accessibility of information and resources to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and maintain healthy environments and determine whether they are culturally relevant, in plain language, and available in appropriate languages and accessible formats.\nIn consultation with local officials, establish transparent criteria for when the school will suspend in-person learning to stop or slow the spread of COVID-19, as well as transparent criteria for when to resume in-person learning.\nAssess students\u2019 special needs (such as continuing education, meal programs, and other services) and develop strategies to address these needs if in-person learning is suspended or if a student needs to self-isolate as a result of a diagnosis of or exposure to COVID-19.\nEnsure the EOP takes into consideration students with disabilities, students with special healthcare needs, students experiencing homelessness, migrant students and those with English learners, etc. Promote behaviors that reduce spread of COVID-19\n\nSchools may consider implementing several strategies to encourage behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19.\n\nStaying home when appropriate\n\nEducate staff and families about when they/their child(ren) should stay home and when they can return to school.\n\nActively encourage employees and students who are sick or who have recently had close contact (less than 6 feet for fifteen minutes or more) with a person with COVID-19 to stay home. Develop policies that encourage sick employees and students to stay at home without fear of reprisal, and ensure employees, students, and students\u2019 families are aware of these policies. Consider not assessing schools based on absenteeism, and offering virtual learning and telework options, if feasible.\nStaff and students should stay home if they have tested positive for or are showing COVID-19 symptoms.\nStaff and students who have recently had close contact with a person with COVID-19 should also stay home and monitor their health.\nCDC\u2019s criteria can help inform when employees should return to work:\nIf they have been sick with COVID-19\nIf they have recently had close contact with a person with COVID-19\nHand hygiene and respiratory etiquette\n\nTeach and reinforce handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and increase monitoring to ensure adherence among students and staff.\nEncourage staff and students to cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Used tissues should be thrown in the trash and hands washed immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\nIf soap and water are not readily available, hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol should be used (for staff and older children who can safely use hand sanitizer).\nMasks\n\nTeach and reinforce use of masks. The use of masks is one of many important mitigation strategies to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Masks are meant to protect other people in case the wearer is unknowingly infected but does not have symptoms. Masks are not Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (e.g., surgical masks, respirators).\nAppropriate and consistent use of masks is most important when students, teachers, and staff are indoors and when social distancing is difficult to implement or maintain. Individuals should be frequently reminded not to touch the face covering or mask and to wash their hands or use hand sanitizer frequently. Information should be provided to staff, students, and students\u2019 families on proper use, removal, and washing of masks.\nMasks should not be placed on:\nChildren younger than 2 years old\nAnyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious\nAnyone who is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance\nAppropriate and consistent use of masks may be challenging for some students, teachers, and staff, including:\nYounger students, such as those in early elementary school (Pre-K through 3rd grade).\nStudents, teachers, and staff with severe asthma or other breathing difficulties.\nStudents, teachers, and staff with special educational or healthcare needs, including intellectual and developmental disabilities, mental health conditions, and sensory concerns or tactile sensitivity.\nWhile masks are strongly encouraged to reduce the spread of COVID-19, CDC recognizes there are specific instances when wearing a mask may not be feasible. In these instances, parents, guardians, caregivers, teachers, staff, and school administrators should consider adaptations and alternatives whenever possible. They may need to consult with healthcare providers for advice about wearing masks.\nPeople who are deaf or hard of hearing\u2014or those who care for or interact with a person who is hearing impaired\u2014may be unable to wear masks if they rely on lipreading to communicate. This may be particularly relevant for faculty or staff teaching or working with students who may be deaf or hard of hearing. In this situation, consider using a clear mask that covers the nose and wraps securely around the face. If a clear mask isn\u2019t available, consider whether faculty and staff can use written communication (including closed captioning) and decrease background noise to improve communication while wearing a mask that blocks your lips.\nMasks are recommended as a simple barrier to help prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air and onto other people when the person wearing the mask coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice. This is called source control.\nIn addition to those who interact with people who are deaf or hard of hearing, the following groups of teachers and staff may also consider using clear masks:\nTeachers of young students (e.g., teaching young students to read).\nTeachers of students who are English language learners\nTeachers of students with disabilities\nClear masks should be determined not to cause any breathing difficulties or over heating for the wearer. Clear masks are not face shields. CDC does not recommend use of face shields for normal everyday activities or as a substitute for masks because of a lack of evidence of their effectiveness to control the spread of the virus from the source for source control.\nAdequate supplies\n\nSupport healthy hygiene behaviors by providing adequate supplies, including soap and water, hand sanitizer with at least 60%  alcohol (for staff and older children who can safely use hand sanitizer), paper towels, tissues, disinfectant wipes, masks (as feasible) and no-touch/foot-pedal trash cans.\n\nSigns and messages\n\nPost signs in highly visible locations (e.g., school entrances, restrooms) that promote everyday protective measurespdf icon and describe how to stop the spreadpdf icon of germs (such as by properly washing hands and properly wearing a maskimage icon). Signs should include visual cues (such as clear, easy-to-understand pictures demonstrating the healthy behaviors) at the appropriate reading and literacy level.\nBroadcast regular announcements on reducing the spread of COVID-19 on PA systems.\nUse simple, clear, and effective language about behaviors that prevent spread of COVID-19 when communicating with staff and families (such as on school websites, in emails, and through school social media accounts). If feasible, provide communication in multiple languages.\nUse communication methods that are accessible for all students, faculty, and staff, including those with disabilities.\nTranslate materials into common languages spoken by students, faculty, and staff and people in the school community.\nFind freely available CDC print and digital resources on CDC\u2019s communications resources main page. CDC also has American Sign Language videos related to COVID-19 and other communication tools. Maintaining healthy environments\n\nSchool administrators may consider implementing several strategies to maintain healthy environments.\n\nCleaning and disinfection\n\nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (e.g., playground equipment, door handles, sink handles, drinking fountains) within the school and on school buses at least daily or between use as much as possible. Use of shared objects (e.g., gym or physical education equipment, art supplies, toys, games) should be limited when possible, or cleaned between use.\nDevelop a schedule for increased frequency of routine cleaning and disinfection.\nIf transport vehicles (e.g., buses) are used by the school, drivers should practice all safety actions and protocols as indicated for other staff (e.g., hand hygiene, masks). To clean and disinfect school buses or other transport vehicles, see guidance for bus transit operators.\nDevelop a schedule for increased, routine cleaning and disinfection.\nEnsure safe and correct use and storage of cleaning and disinfection productsexternal icon, including storing products securely away from children. Use products that meet EPA disinfection criteriaexternal icon.\nCleaning products should not be used near children, and staff should ensure that there is adequate ventilation when using these products to prevent children or themselves from inhaling toxic fumes.\nShared objects\n\nDiscourage sharing of items that are difficult to clean or disinfect.\nKeep each child\u2019s belongings separated from others\u2019 and in individually labeled containers, cubbies, or areas.\nEnsure adequate supplies to minimize sharing of high touch materials to the extent possible (e.g., assigning each student their own art supplies, equipment) or limit use of supplies and equipment by one group of children at a time and clean and disinfect between use.\nAvoid sharing electronic devices, toys, books, and other games or learning aids.\nVentilation\n\nConsider ventilation system upgrades or improvements and other steps to increase the delivery of clean air and dilute potential contaminants in the school. Obtain consultation from experienced Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) professionals when considering changes to HVAC systems and equipment.  Some of the recommendations below are based on the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Guidance for Building Operations During the COVID-19 Pandemicexternal icon. Review additional ASHRAE guidelines for schools and universitiespdf iconexternal icon for further information on ventilation recommendations for different types of buildings and building readiness for occupancy. Not all steps are applicable for all scenarios.\n\nImprovement steps may include some or all of the following activities:\n\nIncrease outdoor air ventilation, using caution in highly polluted areas.\nWhen weather conditions allow, increase fresh outdoor air by opening windows and doors. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk (e.g., risk of falling, triggering asthma symptoms) to children using the facility.\nUse fans to increase the effectiveness of open windows.  Position fans securely and carefully in or near windows so as not to induce potentially contaminated airflow directly from one person over another (strategic window fan placement in exhaust mode can help draw fresh air into room via other open windows and doors without generating strong room air currents).\nDecrease occupancy in areas where outdoor ventilation cannot be increased.\nEnsure ventilation systems operate properly and provide acceptable indoor air quality for the current occupancy level for each space.\nIncrease total airflow supply to occupied spaces, when possible.\nDisable demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) controls that reduce air supply based on occupancy or temperature during occupied hours.\nFurther open minimum outdoor air dampers to reduce or eliminate HVAC air recirculation. In mild weather, this will not affect thermal comfort or humidity. However, this may be difficult to do in cold, hot, or humid weather.\nImprove central air filtration:\nIncrease air filtrationexternal icon to as high as possible without significantly diminishing design airflow.\nInspect filter housing and racks to ensure appropriate filter fit and check for ways to minimize filter bypass\nCheck filters to ensure they are within service life and appropriately installed.\nConsider running the HVAC system at maximum outside airflow for 2 hours before and after the school is occupied.\nEnsure restroom exhaust fans are functional and operating at full capacity when the school is occupied.\nInspect and maintain local exhaust ventilation in areas such as restrooms, kitchens, cooking areas, etc.\nUse portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) fan/filtration systems to help enhance air cleaning (especially in higher risk areas such as the nurse\u2019s office).\nInspect and maintain local exhaust ventilation in areas such as bathrooms, kitchens, cooking areas, etc.\nUse portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) fan/filtration systems to help enhance air cleaning (especially in higher risk areas such as nurse\u2019s office and special education classrooms).\nGenerate clean-to-less-clean air movement by re-evaluating the positioning of supply and exhaust air diffusers and/or dampers (especially in higher risk areas such as the nurse\u2019s office).\nConsider using ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) as a supplement to help inactivate SARS-CoV-2, especially if options for increasing room ventilation are limited.\nVentilation considerations are also important on school buses.\n*Note: The ventilation intervention considerations listed above come with a range of initial costs and operating costs which, along with risk assessment parameters such as community incidence rates, facemask compliance expectations and classroom density, may affect considerations for which interventions are implemented.  Acquisition cost estimates (per room) for the listed ventilation interventions range from $0.00 (opening a window; inspecting and maintain local exhaust ventilation; disabling DCV controls; or repositioning outdoor air dampers) to <$100 (using fans to increase effectiveness of open windows; or repositioning supply/exhaust diffusers to create directional airflow) to approx. $500 (adding portable HEPA fan/filter systems) to approx. $1500 (adding upper room UVGI).\n\nWater systems\n\nThe temporary shutdown or reduced operation of schools and reductions in normal water use can create hazards for returning students and staff. To minimize the risk of lead or copper exposure, Legionnaire\u2019s disease, and other diseases associated with water, take steps such as plumbing flushing to ensure that all water systems and features (e.g., sink faucets, drinking fountains, showers, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown, and follow EPA\u2019s 3Ts, (Training, Testing, and Taking Action) for reducing lead in drinking waterexternal icon. It may be necessary to conduct ongoing regular flushing after reopening. For additional resources, refer to EPA\u2019s Information on Maintaining or Restoring Water Quality in Buildings with Low or No Useexternal icon. Drinking fountains should be cleaned and sanitized.\n\nModified layouts\n\nSpace seating/desks at least 6 feet apart when feasible.\nTurn desks to face in the same direction (rather than facing each other), or have students sit on only one side of tables, spaced apart.\nModify learning stations and activities as applicable so there are fewer students per group, placed at least 6 feet apart if possible.\nCreate distance between children on school buses (g., seat children one child per row, skip rows) when possible.\nPhysical barriers and guides\n\nInstall physical barriers, such as sneeze guards and partitions, particularly in areas where it is difficult for individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart (e.g., reception desks).\nProvide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls, to ensure that staff and children remain at least 6 feet apart in lines and at other times (e.g. guides for creating \u201cone way routes\u201d in hallways).\nCommunal spaces\n\nClose communal use shared spaces such as dining halls and playgrounds with shared playground equipment if possible; otherwise, stagger use and clean and disinfect between use.\nAdd physical barriers, such as plastic flexible screens, between bathroom sinks especially when they cannot be at least 6 feet apart.\nFood service\n\nSchools are essential to meeting the nutritional needs of children with many consuming up to half their daily calories at school. Nationwide more than 30 million children participate in the National School Lunch Program and nearly 15 million participate in the School Breakfast Program. (15, 16) There are several mitigation strategies that schools may implement while providing this critical service to their students.\nAvoid offering any self-serve food or drink options, such as hot and cold food bars, salad or condiment bars, and drink stations. Serve individually plated or pre-packaged meals instead, while ensuring the safety of children with food allergiespdf icon.\nAs feasible, have children eat meals outdoors or in classrooms, while maintaining social distance (at least 6 feet apart) as much as possible, instead of in a communal dining hall or cafeteria.\nHave teachers and children wash their hands with soap and water for 20 seconds or use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol before and after eating. Ensure children do not share food, either brought from home or from the food service.\nIf communal dining halls or cafeterias will be used, ensure that children remain at least 6 feet apart in food service lines and at tables while eating. Clean and disinfect tables and chairs between each use.\nEnsure children do not share food or utensils. This helps prevent the spread of COVID-19 for all students and helps ensure the safety of children with food allergiespdf icon:\nUse disposable food service items (e.g., utensils, trays).\nIf disposable items are not feasible or desirable, ensure that all non-disposable food service items and equipment are handled by staff with gloves and washed with dish soap and hot water or in a dishwasher.\nIndividuals should wash their hands after removing their gloves or after directly handling used food service items.\nIf food is offered at any event, have pre-packaged boxes or bags for each attendee instead of a buffet or family-style meal.\nProvide tissues and no-touch or foot pedal trash cans, where possible, for employees, volunteers, and students to use.\nIf possible, install touchless payment methods (pay without touching money, a card, or a keypad). Provide hand sanitizer right after handling money, cards, or keypads.\nOf Note: USDA has issued the COVID-19 Nationwide Waiver to Allow Meal Pattern Flexibility in the Child Nutrition Programsexternal icon. Maintaining healthy operations\n\nSchools may consider implementing several strategies to maintain healthy operations.\n\nProtections for staff and children at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19\n\nOffer options for staff at higher risk for severe illness (including older adults and people of all ages with certain underlying medical conditions or disabilities) that limit their exposure risk (e.g., telework, modified job responsibilities that limit exposure risk).\nOffer options for students at higher risk of severe illness that limit their exposure risk (e.g., virtual learning opportunities).\nProvide inclusive programming for children and youth with special healthcare needs and disabilities that allows on-site or virtual participation with appropriate accommodations, modifications, and assistance (e.g., students with disabilities may have more difficulties accessing and using technology for virtual learning).\nConsistent with applicable law, put in place policies to protect the privacy of people at higher risk for severe illness regarding underlying medical conditions.\nRegulatory awareness\n\nBe aware of local or state regulatory agency policies related to group gatherings to determine if events can be held.\n\nIdentifying small groups and keeping them together (cohorting or podding)\n\nDividing students and teachers into distinct groups that stay together throughout an entire school day during in-person classroom instruction. Limit mixing between groups such that there is minimal or no interaction between cohorts.\n\nAlternating schedule\n\nAlternate the days when cohorts physically attend school. For example, certain grades or classrooms physically attend school on Monday/Tuesday and other grades or classrooms physically attend on Thursday/Friday (and the school is thoroughly cleaned in between, on Wednesday). As another example, some schools internationally have rotated in-person attendance weekly with one group of students attending during a week, followed by a different group the next week in rotation with thorough cleaning on the weekends.\n\nStaggered scheduling\n\nStagger student arrival, drop-off, and pick-up time or locations by cohort, or put in place other protocols to limit contact between cohorts and direct contact with parents, guardians, and caregivers as much as possible.\nWhen possible, use flexible worksites (e.g., telework at home) and flexible work hours (e.g., staggered shifts) to help establish policies and practices for social distancing (staying at least 6 feet apart).\nMix of virtual learning and in-class learning (hybrid schedule)\n\nHybrid options can apply a cohort approach to the in-class education provided.\n\nVirtual/at-home only\n\nStudents and teachers engage in virtual-only classes, activities, and events.\n\nGatherings, visitors, and field trips\n\nPursue virtual group events, gatherings, or meetings, if possible, and promote social distancing of at least 6 feet between people if events are held. Limit group size to the extent possible.\nPursue options to convene sporting events and participate in sports activities in ways that reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to players, families, coaches, and communities.\nLimit any nonessential visitors, volunteers, and activities involving external groups or organizations as possible \u2013 especially with individuals who are not from the local geographic area (e.g., community, town, city, county).\nLimit cross-school transfer for special programs. For example, if students are brought from multiple schools for special programs (e.g., music, robotics, academic clubs, sports), consider using distance learning and virtual environments to deliver the instruction or temporarily offering duplicate programs in the participating schools.  For youth sports considerations visit the FAQs for Youth Sports Programs (e.g., physical distance, wearing masks, etc.).\nDevelop a plan for staff who travel between schools (e.g., school nurses, psychologists, therapists). For example, consider allowing them to have virtual meetings in place of physical school visits and revise scheduling to limit their visits to multiple campuses.\nPursue virtual activities and events in lieu of field trips, student assemblies, special performances, school-wide parent meetings, and spirit nights, as possible.\nDesignated COVID-19 point of contact\n\nDesignate a staff person, such as the school nurse, to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns. All school staff and families should know who this person is and how to contact them.\n\nTravel and transit\n\nConsider options for limiting non-essential travel in accordance with state and local regulations and guidance.\nConsider postponing or canceling upcoming student international travel programs.\nEncourage students, faculty and staff who use public transportation or ride sharing to use forms of transportation that minimize close contact with others (e.g., biking, walking, driving or riding by car either alone or with household members).\nEnsure options for safe travel on campus for people with disabilities. For example, social distancing in designated seating areas for wheelchairs may not be possible and drivers who may need to have close contact to assist a person with disabilities.\nEncourage students, faculty and staff who use public transportation or ride sharing to follow CDC guidance on how to protect yourself when using Additionally, encourage them to commute during less busy times and clean their hands as soon as possible after their trip.\nParticipation in community response efforts\n\nConsider participating with local authorities in broader COVID-19 community response efforts (e.g., sitting on community response committees).\n\nCommunication systems\n\nPut systems in place for:\n\nStaff and families should self-report to the school if they or their student have symptoms of COVID-19, a positive test for COVID-19, or were exposed to someone with COVID-19 within the last 14 days. The reporting system should be consistent with the health information sharing regulations for COVID-19external icon (e.g. see \u201cNotify Health Officials and Close Contacts\u201d in the Preparing for When Someone Gets Sick section below) and other applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and confidentiality, such as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). The communication methods should be accessible for all students, faculty and staff, including those with disabilities and limited English proficiency (e.g., use interpreters and translated materials)\nNotifying staff, families, and the public of school closures and any restrictions in place to limit COVID-19 exposure (e.g., limited hours of operation).\nLeave (time off) policies and excused absence policies\n\nImplement flexible sick leave policies and practices that enable staff to stay home when they are sick, have been exposed, or caring for someone who is sick.\nExamine and revise policies for leave, telework, and employee compensation.\nLeave policies should be flexible and not punish people for taking time off and should allow sick employees to stay home and away from co-workers. Leave policies should also account for employees who need to stay home with their children if there are school or childcare closures, or to care for sick family members.  Additional flexibilities might include giving advances on future sick leave days and allowing employees to donate sick leave to each other, for example.\nDevelop policies for return-to-school after COVID-19 illness. CDC\u2019s criteria to discontinue home isolation and quarantine can inform these policies.\nBack-up staffing plan\n\nMonitor absenteeism of students and employees, cross-train staff, and create a roster of trained back-up staff.\n\nStaff training\n\nTrain staff on all safety protocols.\nConduct training virtually or ensure that social distancing is maintained during training.\nRecognize signs and symptoms\n\nWe learn more about COVID-19 every day, and as more information becomes available, CDC will continue to update and share information. As our knowledge and understanding of COVID-19 evolves, this guidance may change.\n\nBased on the best available evidence at this time:\n\nCDC does not currently recommend universal symptom screenings (screening all students grades K-12) be conducted by schools.\nParents or caregivers should be strongly encouraged to monitor their children for signs of infectious illness including COVID-19 every day.\nStudents who have symptoms of any infectious illness or symptoms consistent with COVID-19 should not attend school in-person.\nThe profile of symptoms associated with COVID-19 remains under study and will be updated as warranted by research findings. Further information on what symptoms may suggest infectious illness and recommended return-to-school policies is available at Screening K-12 Students for Symptoms of COVID-19: Limitations and Considerations.\nSchools that choose to conduct symptom screening should conduct these screenings safely and respectfully, and in accordance with any applicable privacy laws and regulations (e.g., confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act [FERPA]).\nThe considerations detailed here are intended only for students in K-12 school settings. For guidance related to screening of staff, please refer to CDC\u2019s Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers Responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 and the Prevent Transmission Among Employees section of CDC\u2019s Resuming Business Toolkitpdf icon.\nSharing facilities\n\nEncourage any organizations that share or use the school facilities to also follow these considerations.\n\nSupport coping and resilience \n\nEncourage employees and students to take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories about COVID-19, including social media if they are feeling overwhelmed or distressed.\nPromote employees and students eating healthy, exercising, getting sleep, and finding time to unwind.\nEncourage employees and students to talk with people they trust about their concerns and how they are feeling.\nTransparently communicate with staff, teachers, students, and families, including about mental health support services available at the school. These critical communications should be accessible to individuals with disabilities and limited English proficiency.\nShare facts about COVID-19 regularly through trusted sources of information to counter the spread of misinformation and mitigate fear.\nConsider posting signages for the national distress hotline: 1-800-985-5990, or text TalkWithUsto 66746\nEnsure continuity of mental health services, such as offering remote counseling.\nEncourage students to call 911 or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255), 1-888-628-9454 for Spanish, or Lifeline Crisis Chatexternal icon if they are feeling overwhelmed with emotions such as sadness, depression, anxiety, or feel like wanting to harm themselves or others. Prepare for when someone is sick with COVID-19\n\nSchools may consider implementing several strategies to prepare for when someone is sick with COVID-19.\n\nAdvise staff and families of students sick with COVID-19 of home isolation criteria\n\nSick staff members or students should not return until they have met CDC\u2019s criteria to discontinue home isolation.\n\nMake sure that staff and families know when they should stay home\n\nMake sure that staff and families know that they (staff) or their children (families) should not come to school, and that they should notify school officials (e.g., the designated COVID-19 point of contact [e.g., school nurse]) if they (staff) or their child (families) test positive for COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 symptoms or a confirmed or suspected case. These critical communications should be accessible to individuals with disabilities and limited English proficiency.\n\nIsolate and transport students who develop symptoms while at school\n\nSome students may develop symptoms of infectious illness while at school. Schools should take action to isolate students who develop these symptoms from other students and staff. Follow the school isolation protocol outlined in Screening K-12 Students for Symptoms of COVID-19: Limitations and Considerations when student develops symptoms of an infectious illness.\n\nClean and disinfect\n\nClose off areas used by a sick person and do not use these areas until after cleaning and disinfecting them. For outdoor areas (e.g., playgrounds, sitting areas, outdoor eating areas, etc.), this includes surfaces or shared objects in the area, if applicable.\nWait at least 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible. Ensure safe and correct use and storage of cleaning and disinfection productsexternal icon, including storing products securely away from children.\nNotify health officials and close contacts\n\nIn accordance with state and local laws and regulations, school administrators should notify local health officials, staff, and families immediately of any case of COVID-19 while maintaining confidentiality in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)external icon and FERPAexternal icon or and other applicable laws and regulations.\nInform those who have had close contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19 to stay home and self-monitor for symptoms, and follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop. Maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)external icon and Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) or and other applicable laws and regulations.\nA school might need to implement short-term building closure procedures if/when an infected person has been on campus during their infectious period and has close contact with others. If this happens, work with local public health officials to determine next steps. One option is an initial short-term class suspension and cancellation of events and activities (e.g., assemblies, spirit nights, field trips, and sporting events) to allow time for local health officials to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation and help the school determine appropriate next steps, including whether such a suspension needs to be extended to stop or slow further spread of COVID-19.  In situations where schools are cohorting students (e.g., in pods) administrators may choose to close the building in places (e.g., classrooms, common areas) where others were exposed to the infected person. In the event that local health officials do not recommend building or classroom closures, thoroughly cleaning the areas where the infected person spent significant time should be considered.\nLocal health officials\u2019 recommendations whether to suspend school or events and the duration such suspensions should be made on a case-by-case basis using the most up-to-date information about COVID-19 and taking into account local case-counts, and the degree of ongoing transmission in the community.",

            "Text": "Who this is for: This information is intended for use by employers and employees in retail, services, and other customer-based businesses. Retail or service businesses sell goods and provide services to the public and include department stores, grocery stores, gas stations, and restaurants. These businesses are open and have started state-directed, municipality-directed, and company-directed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention policies and practices to minimize the spread of the virus among employees and customers.\n\nThis information is not intended to address every business setting. A business may need to adapt these strategies based on its physical space, staffing, and other factors.\n\nPurpose: This webpage offers strategies to limit violence towards workers that may occur when businesses put in place policies and practices to help minimize the spread of COVID-19 among employees and customers. These policies may include requiring masks to be worn by employees and customers, asking customers to follow social distancing rules, and setting limits on the number of customers allowed in a business facility at one time.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may update this page periodically. Please check the CDC COVID-19 website regularly for updated guidance.\n\nPlease check the CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers Responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) for general business guidance on preventing COVID-19.\n\nWorkplace violence is \u201cviolent acts, including physical assaults and threats of assault, directed toward persons at work or on duty.\u201d Workplace violence includes\n\nThreat: verbal, written, and physical expressions that could reasonably be interpreted as intending to cause harm.\nVerbal assault: yelling, swearing, insulting, or bullying another person with the intent of hurting or causing harm. Unlike physical assaults, the intent is not necessarily to cause physical harm, but negative emotions of the person being assaulted.\nPhysical assault: hitting, slapping, kicking, pushing, choking, grabbing, or other physical contact with the intent of causing injury or harm.\nConflict resolution is the process of finding a peaceful end to a conflict or argument.\n\nA nonviolent response is a peaceful approach to address a situation in which a person is aggressive or threatening. This technique involves remaining calm, giving a person space, making sure other people are in the area, and not touching the person or trying to forcibly remove them.\n\nWorkplace violence and COVID-19\nWorkers may be threatened and assaulted as businesses try to put into place COVID-19 prevention policies and practices (e.g., mandatory use of masks, social distancing, and limits on the number of customers allowed in a business). These threats and assaults can come from customers, other employees, or employers. Based on a 1996 Current Intelligence Bulletin, threats and assaults can happen in any workplace, but may be more likely to occur in retail, services (e.g., restaurants), and other customer- or client-based businesses.\n\nResources and Trainings on Workplace Violence\nEmployers and employees can use the following resources and trainings to learn more about how to prevent and deal with workplace violence:\n\nFAA Workplace Violence Prevention and Responsepdf iconexternal icon\nFBI Workplace Violence: Issues in Responseexternal icon\nNIOSH Occupational Violence\nOSHA Recommendations for Workplace Violence Prevention Programs in Late-Night Retail Establishmentspdf iconexternal icon\nEmployers can take action to prevent workplace violence Offer customers options to minimize their contact with others and promote social distancing. These options can include curbside pick-up; personal shoppers; home delivery for groceries, food, and other services; and alternative shopping hours. Post signs that let customers know about policies for wearing masks, social distancing, and the maximum number of people allowed in a business facility. Advertise COVID-19-related policies on the business website. Provide employee training on threat recognition, conflict resolution, nonviolent response, and on any other relevant topics related to workplace violence response. Put in place steps to assess and respond to workplace violence. Response will depend on the severity of the violence and on the size and structure of the business. Possible responses may include reporting to a manager or supervisor on-duty, calling security, or calling 911. Remain aware of and support employees and customers if a threatening or violent situation occurs. Assign two workers to work as a team to encourage COVID-19 prevention policies be followed, if staffing permits.

A business may need to adapt these strategies based on its physical space, staffing, and other factors.\n\nPurpose: This webpage offers strategies to limit violence towards workers that may occur when businesses put in place policies and practices to help minimize the spread of COVID-19 among employees and customers. These policies may include requiring masks to be worn by employees and customers, asking customers to follow social distancing rules, and setting limits on the number of customers allowed in a business facility at one time.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may update this page periodically. Please check the CDC COVID-19 website regularly for updated guidance.\n\nPlease check the CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers Responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) for general business guidance on preventing COVID-19.\n\nWorkplace violence is \u201cviolent acts, including physical assaults and threats of assault, directed toward persons at work or on duty.\u201d Workplace violence includes\n\nThreat: verbal, written, and physical expressions that could reasonably be interpreted as intending to cause harm.\nVerbal assault: yelling, swearing, insulting, or bullying another person with the intent of hurting or causing harm. Unlike physical assaults, the intent is not necessarily to cause physical harm, but negative emotions of the person being assaulted.\nPhysical assault: hitting, slapping, kicking, pushing, choking, grabbing, or other physical contact with the intent of causing injury or harm.\nConflict resolution is the process of finding a peaceful end to a conflict or argument.\n\nA nonviolent response is a peaceful approach to address a situation in which a person is aggressive or threatening. This technique involves remaining calm, giving a person space, making sure other people are in the area, and not touching the person or trying to forcibly remove them.\n\nWorkplace violence and COVID-19\nWorkers may be threatened and assaulted as businesses try to put into place COVID-19 prevention policies and practices (e.g., mandatory use of masks, social distancing, and limits on the number of customers allowed in a business). These threats and assaults can come from customers, other employees, or employers. Based on a 1996 Current Intelligence Bulletin, threats and assaults can happen in any workplace, but may be more likely to occur in retail, services (e.g., restaurants), and other customer- or client-based businesses.\n\nResources and Trainings on Workplace Violence\nEmployers and employees can use the following resources and trainings to learn more about how to prevent and deal with workplace violence:\n\nFAA Workplace Violence Prevention and Responsepdf iconexternal icon\nFBI Workplace Violence: Issues in Responseexternal icon\nNIOSH Occupational Violence\nOSHA Recommendations for Workplace Violence Prevention Programs in Late-Night Retail Establishmentspdf iconexternal icon\nEmployers can take action to prevent workplace violence Offer customers options to minimize their contact with others and promote social distancing. These options can include curbside pick-up; personal shoppers; home delivery for groceries, food, and other services; and alternative shopping hours. Post signs that let customers know about policies for wearing masks, social distancing, and the maximum number of people allowed in a business facility. Advertise COVID-19-related policies on the business website.

            "HeadLine": "As students return, the deaths of at least six teachers from covid-19 renew pandemic fears",
            "Text": "Teachers had just returned last month to prepare for the fall semester at John Evans Middle School in Potosi, Mo., when 34-year-old AshLee DeMarinis started to feel ill.\n\nDeMarinis had been worried about returning to work at the rural middle school, where she was starting her 11th year of teaching. She had asthma, which put her at a higher risk for complications from covid-19 despite her young age.\n\n\u201cShe was scared,\u201d her sister, Jennifer Heissenbuttel, told The Washington Post.\n\nThree weeks later, DeMarinis died in the hospital after testing positive for the novel coronavirus and suffering from complications caused by the infection.\n\nDeMarinis isn\u2019t the only teacher to die amid the pandemic as children return to schools across the United States. Educators in Missouri, Mississippi, South Carolina, Iowa and Oklahoma have died as the fall semester started in their districts. It isn\u2019t clear whether any of the teachers were infected at school, and many quarantined to avoid exposing students and other staff members. But their deaths have renewed fears that school campuses will become a breeding ground for the virus, spreading the illness as communities grapple with how to balance the need to educate children with properly addressing the pandemic. School districts and state officials have struggled to find the right coronavirus precautions. In Georgia, one school district was forced to send hundreds of people home to quarantine after just one day of school prep on campus. Another district in that state ordered 900 children and staff to quarantine after being exposed to the virus during the first week back in class.\n\nA Georgia district returned to school last week. More than 900 students and staff are now quarantined.\n\nDeMarinis was an avid crafter who spent her summer at a lake with her sister and her nieces. When she returned to school on Aug. 10, she was concerned about the pandemic, her sister told The Post, but she got to work readying the classroom for her students who were set to start classes in a few weeks.\n\n\u201cShe taught special education, and it was just her calling,\u201d her sister said. \u201cHer students loved her and her colleagues loved her.\u201d DeMarinis initially thought she had an ear infection when she started to feel sick on Aug. 14. But her condition worsened quickly, and by Aug. 19 she tested positive for coronavirus. She died on Sunday after three weeks on a ventilator at the hospital.\n\nNationally, at least five other teachers have died since early August.\n\nThis week, Demetria \u201cDemi\u201d Bannister, a 28-year-old third-grade teacher in Columbia, S.C., died from complications of the coronavirus, the State reported. On Sunday, Tom Slade, a 53-year-old high school history teacher in Vancleave, Miss., died of the virus, the Sun Herald reported.\n\nNacoma James, 42, a beloved football coach in Oxford, Miss., died in early August during the first week back on campus for his students. He spent the summer coaching at football practices until he was forced to self-quarantine after developing coronavirus-like symptoms, Mississippi Today reported. The deaths have disrupted the start of the fall semester for many schools, and left students mourning their favorite instructors and role models.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a gut punch really,\u201d one of Slade\u2019s students, Chase Hall, told WLOX. \u201cHe was a man I respected. I looked forward to him coming back to the classroom, and then he was gone.\u201d\n\nStay safe and informed with our free Coronavirus Updates newsletter\n\nSome districts have also been struggling to comply with quarantine requirements as staff and students test positive for the virus. Two days after children returned to classes in Tahlequah, Okla., school district officials confirmed special education teacher Teresa Horn, 62, died on Aug. 28 from a heart attack after testing positive for the coronavirus, KTUL reported.\n\n\u201cIt is with a heavy heart that I announce the passing of one of our teachers,\u201d Tahlequah Public Schools said in a statement. \u201cLosing a member of your family is never easy and in the current climate, it makes the situation even worse.\u201d Tahlequah Public Schools sent students home for two days of virtual classes following Horn\u2019s death. In a little over a week since, the district has reported at least eight students and staff members have tested positive and dozens have been forced to quarantine after possible exposure to the virus at school.\n\nEven in districts that have committed to virtual classes, keeping kids off-campus is no guarantee the virus won\u2019t spread among staff members.\n\nA week before virtual classes were set to start in Des Moines, a teacher died after testing positive for the virus, sparking additional fears in a district that has been battling with state leaders over a statewide mandate requiring at least 50 percent of classes to involve in-person instruction.\n\n\u201cThis death has shook many teachers in the district to our cores and underscores the importance of our district having the authority to keep our students, staff and community safe based on local health conditions,\u201d Josh Brown, president of the Des Moines Education Association, told the Des Moines Register.",

            "HeadLine": "What explains surge in coronavirus numbers in India?",
            "Text": "New Delhi, India - India has added another 300,000 coronavirus infections to its caseload in the past four days, an infection rate which could see it overtake the United States to become the world's worst-affected country within weeks.\n\nThe country registered 96,551 new cases - a fresh global record - on Friday.\n\nOn Monday, India had surpassed Brazil as the country with the second-highest number of coronavirus cases in the world, with 4.2 million cases. The US has a caseload of 6.4 million infections.\n\nMore than 76,000 people in India have died due to the coronavirus, which has killed more than 909,000 people worldwide. \n\nIndia's health ministry says the surge in cases is due to an increase in daily testing that has now exceeded one million.\n\nDespite the steep surge in new cases and deaths, India continues to ease restrictions and open up its economy to make up for losses incurred during its long and punishing lockdown period, which experts believe was rushed through and \"illogical\". The March lockdown forced hundreds of thousands of workers to flee cities for their homes, and experts say it probably contributed to the spread of the virus in rural areas.\n\nMoreover, they say that the government has not successfully communicated an effective and uniform message on masking, social distancing and congregation - measures that could have helped contain the spread of the outbreak.\n\nAs the infections spike in rural areas, health experts say the country's crumbling rural health sector is not equipped to deal with the surge in cases in the world's second-most populous nation.\n\nThe only silver lining for the government is the high recovery rate (77 percent) and the low mortality rate (1.6 percent) - points the government continues to emphasise.\n\nPoor health infrastructure\nEven in cities, patients have had to suffer due to poor hospital facilities and protocols. Mohinder Kaur, who was admitted to a government-run Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital in the capital, New Delhi, after testing COVID-19 positive, told Al Jazeera of her ordeal.\n\n\"No one would come near us or even help us. If anyone would accidentally touch us, the staff would shout at them for ruining a PPE (personal protective equipment) kit, the 75-year-old retired school teacher told Al Jazeera. \"In this heat, the fans were not working and the staff would not get them fixed despite several complaints. The toilets were filthy and sometimes had no water. The ward had rats, lizards, cats and even dogs roaming around. It was a living hell and we are fortunate to have survived this,\" she said.\n\nIndia's capital still has better health facilities in comparison to rural areas where only 20 percent of India's doctors and 40 percent of hospitals are located. Health experts feel that this could put millions of people at risk. \"India's epidemic is two-part, urban followed by rural, each consisting of innumerable outbreaks - each district or city/large town with its own outbreak, the sum total is what is seen in numbers,\" said Dr T Jacob John, epidemiologist and former professor at Christian Medical College, Vellore.\n\n\"In the last week of August, the epidemic reached all nooks and corners - evidenced by infection among tribal communities. That means, spatially the epidemic has peaked,\" he said.\n\nStage four of the pandemic\nJohn says India has entered stage four of the pandemic, which means the country is seeing widespread transmission, and that is reflected in the record number of daily infections in the past several weeks.\n\nBut the government has so far steadfastly denied community transmission, during which the source of contagion is not known. John says India witnessed community transmission (stage three) between March and July. The epidemiologist said authorities must move from the idea of \"control\" to \"mitigation\".\n\nPreeti Kumar, vice president, public health system support at the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), a public-private non-profit, pointed out that India is a federal state and health is largely a state subject.\n\n\"Each state has implemented the response based on the strength of its health system and available resources,\" Kumar told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"Kerala and Punjab states introduced lockdowns even before the rest of the country did. Four southern states (with stronger health systems) have also tested more and reported better.\n\n\"In contrast, the poorer northern states with weaker health systems, are only now beginning to feel the impact and are struggling with testing, tracing, treating and reporting,\" she said.\n\nAccording to Kumar, the Indian government provided much of the leadership in the early stage of the pandemic, and continues to support through strategic guidelines, expertise and some level of funding.\n\nIneffective lockdown Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government had introduced one of the world's strictest lockdowns, triggering a working-class exodus from cities to rural areas and smaller towns.\n\nThe two-month lockdown led to the shuttering of factories and loss of millions of jobs, and experts say the decision, taken at four hours' notice, was \"ineffective and unscientific\". \"The lockdown was wrong, it just destroyed our economy,\" said Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil, epidemiologist and chairperson of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the National Institute of Epidemiology.\n\nCalling it a rushed move, Christian Medical College's John said India's lockdown had no scientific support. \"National lockdown was illogical. It was necessary in different states at different times as they reached phase three,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Kumar of PHFI believes that other countries like South Korea, Japan, Thailand and Taiwan did not see the rise in cases the way India has seen post-lockdown because they had invested heavily in testing, contact-tracing and quarantine.\n\n\"Lockdown was declared to help buy time to prepare the system to cope - prepare facilities, equipment, consumables, testing labs, surveillance systems and health workforce,\" Kumar said. \"These countries also had widespread use of masks, distancing, etc. These interventions together helped flatten the curve. Our scale-up in testing has taken more time, starting from a very low base. Lastly, our public measures and awareness on masking, hygiene and distancing are very low.\"\n\nIn India, especially in rural areas and even semi-urban areas, poor hygiene standards and lack of social distancing measures further contributed to the spread of the virus, experts say.\n\n\"Poor sanitation is the government's failure,\" said John. Kumar from PHFI blamed the government for not successfully communicating an effective, uniform message on masking, distancing and congregating.\n\n\"Beyond the big metros, there is little information on wearing masks. I think the communication has not been sufficiently effective and sustained to spread awareness about it. Opening up is being perceived by people as if the epidemic is no more a threat. This incorrect perception needs to be addressed,\" she added.\n\nAccording to her, countries which have managed to flatten the curve have relied on the government to scale up testing, contact tracing and treatment. \"Alongside, they have effective policies on active public engagement on masking and distancing,\" she told Al Jazeera. India has conducted 54 million tests so far, compared with the US which has conducted more than 90 million tests. The US population is a quarter of India's 1.4 billion people.\n\nGoverning party spokesman defends gov't\nOn flattening the curve, John said, \"Mask-wearing and avoiding crowding, school closure etc has definitely flattened the curve a little bit, not as much as we could have achieved had we done lockdowns in a planned manner.\"\n\nThe only silver lining for India in its fight against the pandemic is its low mortality rate. Experts say the mortality rate is also low in neighbouring countries.\n\n\"Fortunately, COVID-19 mortality is quite low in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Median age in these countries is below 30 and that is one reason for the low mortality. Mortality is also declining globally - my hypothesis is that the virus is becoming less virulent, a natural phenomenon in new hosts and multiple generations of virus growth,\" said John.\n\nA spokesman from the BJP defended the Modi government's management of the pandemic.\n\n\"Those who are saying that lockdown was unscientific have wrong intentions,\" Bizay Sonkar Shastri, BJP's national spokesperson, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"It is because of lockdown that our daily numbers are at around 90,000, otherwise they would been in lakhs [hundred of thousands]. If lockdown was not enforced earlier, we would have been in an even worse position.\n\n\"Those who are raising questions about the lockdown are anti-Modi and anti-BJP,\" he said.",

            "HeadLine": "Coronavirus: Why are women paying a heavier price?",
            "Text": "Humanitarian crises can affect the lives of men and women differently - and the coronavirus pandemic is no exception.\n\nWomen have shown better COVID-19 outcomes than men - in part thanks to an additional X chromosome and sex hormones like oestrogen, which provoke better immune responses to the virus that causes COVID-19. But any such advantage is reversed when it comes to the social and economic effects of the pandemic; here the brunt falls heaviest on women.\n\n\"COVID-19 has had a devastating social and economic impact on women and girls, reversing decades of limited and fragile progress on gender equality,\" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned last week. \n\nSince governments around the world shut borders and slowed economic activities to curb the spread of the coronavirus, the global economy is expected to shrink by more than five percent in 2020 - this would be the worst recession since World War II.\n\nSuch economic hardship, though, reflects differently on men compared with women, who represent 39 percent of the global workforce but account for 54 percent of overall job losses. \n\n\"What has disproportionately affected women is insecurity and loss of employment because women tend to work in informal sectors with no financial protection or benefits,\" explained Avni Amin, a scientist working at the department of sexual and reproductive health and research on violence against women at the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nAs an example, more than 90 percent of the labour force in sub-Saharan Africa is composed of informal workers, most of whom are female, whose jobs are more at risk due to the pandemic, according to a World Bank report. Overall, women's work is 1.8 times more vulnerable than men's, according to data gathered by the management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. \n\n\"Women tend to work in informal sectors, so when the economy goes down, they are the first to lose their jobs,\" Amin said.\n\nThe risk is not just on the economic front. Women make up 70 percent (PDF) of the global health workforce and are highly represented on the front lines. As a result, they are more frequently exposed to infected patients. \n\nData gathered by UN Women shows that of all healthcare workers infected with COVID-19 in Spain and Italy, 72 percent and 66 percent respectively were women. When women can keep their jobs but have to work from home during the pandemic, new challenges arise; more hours of unpaid care work get added to a daily load already disproportionately carried by women. \n\nBefore the pandemic, women performed 76.2 percent of the total hours of unpaid care work, more than three times as much as men, according to the International Labour Organization. This percentage increased to 80 percent when looking at Asia and the Pacific. \n\nWhile they were forced to stay home during lockdowns, women in France, Germany and the United States spent significantly more time caring for children. In other cases, working mothers spent less time on paid work but more on household work. \n\n\"The impact [of the pandemic] on time scarcity for women has been large with implications on stress and mental health,\" said Amin, adding that women are bearing a \"triple burden\" of domestic and family responsibilities, caring for the sick, in addition to work. The advantages of a more gender-balanced recovery plan go beyond the wellbeing of women alone. \n\nIn a gender-regressive scenario in which no action is adopted to cushion the impact of these effects, McKinsey estimated that global gross domestic product growth could be $1 trillion lower in 2030 \"than it would be if women's unemployment simply tracked that of men in each sector\", its report read. As health system capacities are stretched, governments have to prioritise the provision of some health services, while reducing others. \n\n\"Looking at previous outbreaks, such as Ebola, one of the areas where governments tend to cut budgets from is sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning, maternal health services, access to safe abortion - with harmful consequences for women's health,\" said Amin.\n\nThe decrease in availability of sexual and reproductive health services can result in an increased risk of maternal mortality, unintended pregnancies and other adverse sexual and reproductive health outcomes among women and girls.\n\nThe Lancet Global Health journal published a study suggesting that a reduction in maternal health services of between just 9.8 percent to 18.5 percent could lead to as many as 12,200 additional maternal deaths over six months in low and middle-income countries. Violence against women\nAs people around the world were forced to stay home during lockdowns, emerging reports from several countries showed increased incidents of violence against women and girls, especially intimate partner violence, a recent study by UN Women found. In many cases, increased time spent at home with an abuser, the stress caused by uncertainty about the future, financial worries combined with the reduced access to support systems - such as friends, extended family and neighbours - can exacerbate existing tensions and conflicts. In Colombia, for example, reports of gender-based violence during lockdown increased by 175 percent compared with the previous year, according to Plan International.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, the violence service of the Ministry of Women's Affairs, L\u00ednea Mujer, received 619 calls during the first 25 days of quarantine.\n\n'Be mindful'\nSo, what can governments do to cushion the gendered impact of COVID-19?\n\nThe state of Hawaii has paved the way in showing what a post-recovery plan that addresses the impact on women and girls could look like. In its first Feminist Economic Recovery Plan, the island state prioritised spending not on infrastructure but on healthcare services. The plan includes maternal, sexual and reproductive healthcare services, on top of broader support for parents and caregivers. \"All the COVID and post-COVID recovery, emergency, preparedness and response plans really need to make sure health services for women, and services to respond to violence against women, are considered part of the essential package of services that are continued during and after COVID,\" Amin said.\n\nGovernments also need to make sure \"that social and financial protection is for those most likely to lose their jobs - and we know that by default these are women because they primarily work in informal sectors,\" she added.",

            "Text": "Progress in reducing child mortality, which fell to an all-time low in 2019, is at risk as the coronavirus pandemic disrupts health services and deprives mothers and young children of access to care, particularly in poor countries, the United Nations has warned.\n\nThe joint report by UN agencies, including the UN children's fund UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO), said preventable deaths among children under five dropped to 5.2 million in 2019 compared with 12.5 million in 1990, but the pandemic was \"putting millions of additional lives at stake\".\n\n\"The global community has come too far towards eliminating preventable child deaths to allow the COVID-19 pandemic to stop us in our tracks,\" said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF chief.\n\n\"When children are denied access to health services because the system is overrun, and when women are afraid to give birth at the hospital for fear of infection, they, too, may become casualties of COVID-19.\"\n\nFore called for \"urgent investments\" to resume disrupted health services, warning that millions of children were at risk without routine care. According to a study carried out by UNICEF in 77 countries, 68 percent faced interruption to health systems as a result of the pandemic, from vaccination programmes to medical visits for children, while 63 and 59 percent reported disruptions to ante-natal care and neo-natal care respectively. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the progress in reducing child mortality \"is proof of what is possible\" when countries make health a priority.\n\n\"We must not let the COVID-19 pandemic jeopardise this remarkable progress for our children and future generations\", he stressed.\n\n'Vast inequality'\nAnte- and neo-natal care in developing nations is relatively inexpensive and can profoundly affect child survival rates.\n\nFor example, women who receive care from professional midwives are 16 percent less likely to lose their baby and 24 percent less likely to experience pre-term birth, according to the WHO.\n\nThe survey found that seven countries had child mortality rates of more than 50 deaths in 1,000 live births last year. In Afghanistan, where 1 in 17 children die before their fifth birthday, the health ministry reported a \"significant reduction\" in visits to health facilities, UNICEF said.\n\nWhile that might be a result of fear of contracting COVID-19, avoiding healthcare facilities that have nothing to do with the coronavirus is a risk, experts say.\n\nMuhammad Ali Pate, global director for health, nutrition and population at the World Bank, says the pandemic is putting efforts to end preventable child deaths in \"serious jeopardy\".\n\n\"It is essential to protect life-saving services which have been key to reducing child mortality,\" he said.\n\nModelling conducted earlier this year by Johns Hopkins University found that almost 6,000 additional children could die every day if COVID-19 healthcare disruptions continued in the medium term.",

            "Text": "Reeling from the fallout of another crisis of his own creation, President Donald Trump was trying to move past revelations that he was determined to play down the threat of the coronavirus as he headed for a rally in the battleground state of Michigan on Thursday.\n\nBut the president was facing renewed pushback from local leaders worried that his rallies are growing in size and flouting public health guidelines intended to halt the spread of the virus. This week, the state of Nevada became the first to scuttle Trump's plans for rallies initially set for Las Vegas and Reno. Michigan's Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer has also raised alarms about Thursday's event.\n\nThe back-and-forth comes as the White House is grappling with fallout from a new book by Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward. In a series of interviews with Woodward, Trump spoke frankly about the dangers posed by the virus - even as he downplayed them publicly - and admitted he had tried to mislead the public. The book has refocused attention on Trump's handling of the virus, a subject he has tried to shift away from less than two months before the November 3 presidential election. In a tweet on Thursday morning, Trump defended his comments admitting that he had been warned about the danger of the virus.\n\n\"Bob Woodward had my quotes for many months,\" Trump wrote. \"If he thought they were so bad or dangerous, why didn't he immediately report them in an effort to save lives? Didn't he have an obligation to do so? No, because he knew they were good and proper answers. Calm, no panic!\"\n\nWoodward has defended his decision to hold off by saying he needed time to make sure Trump's private comments were true.\n\n\nAD\n\n\"I wanted to always play it down,\" Trump told Woodward on March 19, days after he declared a national emergency. \"I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic.\"\n\nCNN on Wednesday broadcast interviews Woodward did with Trump for his new book, Rage, which is due to go on sale next Tuesday.\n\nThe Republican president, assailed by his Democratic rival Joe Biden about the US government response to the coronavirus, played down the crisis for months as it took hold and spread across the country.\n\nIn the March 19 conversation, Trump told Woodward that some \"startling facts\" had emerged showing the extent of those at risk: \"It's not just old, older. Young people too, plenty of young people.\"\n\nIn taped conversations released along with the excerpts, Trump insisted he did not want to create \"panic\". But his comments also raised fresh questions about how he has managed the defining crisis of his presidency, one that has killed about 190,000 Americans so far, with no end in sight. \"The fact is, I'm a cheerleader for this country. I love our country and I don't want people to be frightened,\" Trump said at the White House. \"We've done well from any standard.\" According to the interviews, CNN and The Washington Post reported, Trump knew the virus was dangerous in early February.\n\n\"It goes through the air,\" Trump said in a recording of a February 7 interview with Woodward. \"That's always tougher than the touch. You don't have to touch things. Right? But the air, you just breathe the air and that's how it's passed.\n\n\"And so that's a very tricky one. That's a very delicate one. It's also more deadly than even your strenuous flus.\"\n\nA week after that interview, Trump said at a White House briefing that the number of US coronavirus cases \"within a couple days is going to be down close to zero.\"\n\nWoodward in an interview with The Associated Press news agency defended himself from online critics who questioned why he kept Trump's comments to himself for months as a pandemic raged.\n\n\"He tells me this, and I'm thinking, 'Wow, that's interesting, but is it true?' Trump says things that don't check out, right?\" the news agency quoted Woodward as saying in a phone interview. Some fellow Republicans defended Trump's coronavirus response on Wednesday.\n\n\"His actions of shutting the economy down were the right actions,\" Senator Lindsey Graham said. \"And I think the tone during that time sort of spoke for itself.\"\n\nWoodward conducted 18 interviews with Trump for the book. Other revelations include Trump's disparaging remarks about US military leaders. He drew criticism this week following reports that he had denigrated fallen military personnel and veterans.\n\nIn Woodward's book, an aide to former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis heard Trump say in a meeting, \"my f***ing generals are a bunch of p**sies\" because they cared more about alliances than trade deals. Mattis asked the aide to document the comment in an email, the Washington Post reported. Regarding the Black Lives Matter movement, Woodward asked Trump his views on the concept of white privilege and whether he felt isolated by that privilege from the plight of Black Americans.\n\n\"No. You really drank the Kool-Aid, didn't you? Just listen to you,\" Trump replied, according to media reports on the book. \"Wow. No, I don't feel that at all.\"\n\nRevelations from the Woodward book emerged just as Trump's campaign was beginning to feel that the virus was receding from public view. The president himself has been thumbing his nose at public health experts' warning against the sort of large gatherings - with few people wearing masks - that his campaign has been staging around the country.\n\nFor all of that, Trump has faced devastating revelations of his own creation before and survived them. They stretch back to his 2015 comments questioning the heroism of Senator John McCain, a decorated Vietnam prisoner of war, and the notorious Access Hollywood tape that emerged just before the 2016 election in which Trump described sexually assaulting women.",

They said they still held out hope for negotiations to produce a compromise, but some senators expressed doubts that would happen before the November 3 presidential and congressional elections.\n\nSo far, the coronavirus has led to the deaths of nearly 191,000 people in the US and more than 900,000 globally. Congress is now expected to mainly focus on work on other pressing legislation so members can return to their home states in October to campaign for re-election.\n\nEarlier this year, Congress quickly passed four important bills providing about $3 trillion to respond to the COVID-19 crisis.

            "Text": "AstraZeneca has \"voluntarily paused\" late-stage trials of the highly-anticipated COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with the University of Oxford after one of the study volunteers developed an unexplained illness, the company said on Wednesday.\n\nThe AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine is seen as one of the most promising of coronavirus vaccine candidates currently under development.\n\n\"As part of the ongoing randomized, controlled global trials of the Oxford coronavirus vaccine, our standard review process was triggered and we voluntarily paused vaccination to allow review of safety data by an independent committee,\" said Michele Meixell, the company's spokeswoman.\n\n\"This is a routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials, while it is investigated, ensuring we maintain the integrity of the trials.\"\n\nHealth news website Stat News earlier reported that the trial would be suspended because a volunteer had suffered a severe adverse reaction to the drug. \n\nAstraZeneca said that in large trials, illnesses sometimes occur in participants by chance, but that the issue had to be reviewed independently.\n\n\"We are working to expedite the review of the single event to minimise any potential impact on the trial timeline,\" Meixell said.\n\nThe drug is in trials involving thousands of people in the United States, Brazil, South Africa and the UK, where the patient who fell ill is. Julie Fischer, an associate research professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University, told Al Jazeera such a pause was \"part of the process\" of drug development and clinical trials.\n\n\"For a pause, the event would need to be serious; something related to the heart, lungs, kidneys or other part of the body's health system that required medical attention and was sufficiently serious to merit a pause to this very important vaccine trial in order to make sure it is safe, and that the adverse effect is not due to the vaccine itself.\"  \n\nFlorian Krammer, professor of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai said the fact a patient had fallen ill underscored the need for extensive trials.\n\n\"It shows you that the evaluation process works, and why we need Phase III trials,\" he wrote on Twitter. Clinical trial holds are not uncommon, but AstraZeneca's is the first phase-three COVID-19 vaccine trial known to have been put on hold. It is unclear how long the suspension might last and shares of the company fell more than 6 percent in after-hours trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The progress of the company's trial - and those of all COVID-19 vaccines in development - is being closely watched, given the pressing need for new ways to curb the global pandemic. There are currently nine vaccine candidates in Phase III trials.\n\nSafety protocols\nSeparately, nine leading US and European vaccine developers promised on Tuesday to uphold scientific standards in the global race to contain the pandemic.\n\nThe companies, including Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca, in a joint statement made a \"historic pledge ... to uphold the integrity of the scientific process as they work towards potential global regulatory filings and approvals of the first COVID-19 vaccines\".\n\nThe unusual move to promise to play by well-established rules underlines the highly politicised debate over what action is needed to rein in the spread of the disease. The head of the Food and Drug Administration, the US regulator, said last month that the normal approval process could be bypassed for a COVID-19 vaccine if officials were convinced the benefits outweighed the risks. The comments prompted a call for caution from the World Health Organization. Developers globally have yet to produce large-scale trial data showing actual infections in participants, but Russia approved a COVID-19 vaccine last month, prompting some Western experts to criticise a lack of testing.\n\nThe head of China's Sinovac Biotech said most of its employees and their families have already taken an experimental vaccine developed by the Chinese firm under the country's emergency-use programme.",

Others, like Liu Hewei, are not.\n\n\"A person's true death is when the whole world has forgotten them,\" said Taoist priest Liang Xingyang, who started the collection on January 29, shortly after Chinese authorities announced that the virus could pass between humans.\n\n\"No matter what religion or beliefs they hold, their spirit deserves to be passed on. In fact, they live on in our hearts,\" adding that Taoists use memorial tablets to give souls a place to rest after death.\n\nTaoism, or Daoism, is a philosophy-turned-religion that has tens of millions of followers in China and is one of the country's five officially sanctioned religions. The monastery complex, where a small community of priests lives, sleeps, eats and worships, is spread across a rocky hill. In a hall perched high up, reached by a steep flight of stairs, the ornate gold and blue slabs stand in neat rows.\n\nAn act of remembrance on such a scale is unusual in China - Liang believes his is the only such collection linked either to Taoism or Buddhism.\n\nChina, where the coronavirus was first recorded in the city of Wuhan late last year, has held remembrance events arranged by the government, and some museums have asked the public to donate items to commemorate the country's fight against COVID-19.\n\nAs of September 8, there have been 85,146 confirmed COVID-19 cases in mainland China, of whom 4,634 have died. Globally, more than 27 million people have been infected, more than 18 million recovered, and at least 897,000 people have died from COVID-19.\n\nOf those honoured by the tablets, only a minority died of COVID-19. Most died from other causes, like exhaustion from overwork, Liang said, adding that he compiled his list of \"heroes\" based on state media reports or government notices.\n\nLiu, for instance, was a 42-year-old government official from Inner Mongolia who died in February of a heart attack after working 20 days consecutively as a deputy director of a large local market. \"I think that enabling them to see each other in this way, enabling relatives to discover that after one of their family had lost their life, someone else remembers them, I think this is the greatest comfort to me,\" Liang explained.",

Typical aid budgets would not cover the costs, the UN chief added, urging donors to \"go deep\" into money set aside for combating coronavirus.\n\nThe spike in new infections, has prompted countries to tighten restrictions that had previously been relaxed. Portugal has limited gatherings to 10 people rather than 20 previously, and banned the sale of alcohol from 8pm, while the United Kingdom will impose a ban on gatherings involving more than six people from Monday.\n\nIn the Balearic Islands region of Spain, a popular holiday destination, 20,000 people in four areas of the Palma de Mallorca will be confined to their homes from Friday night except to go to work or school or seek medical care.\n\nThe French government will meet on Friday to consider new measures, and the possibility of smaller, local lockdowns.\n\n'Wake-up call'\nCOVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan in central China late last year and has now been diagnosed in nearly 28 million people around the world, leaving 906,195 people dead. The WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic in March.\n\nScientists have been working around the clock to develop better treatments for the virus, and a vaccine that would enable people to return to normal life. According to the WHO's latest overview, 35 candidate vaccines for the virus are being tested on humans, of which nine have reached phase three trials where they are tested on tens of thousands of people. This week, AstraZeneca, which is developing a vaccine with Oxford University, put its trials on hold after one of its volunteers in the UK developed neurological symptoms.\n\nSoumya Swaminathan, the agency's chief scientist, sought to reassure on Thursday.\n\n\"This is a wake-up call to recognise that there are ups and downs in clinical development and we have to be prepared,\" she said. \"We do not have to be discouraged. These things happen.\" A further 145 candidate vaccines are in earlier testing phases. Typically only about 10 percent of candidate vaccines succeed.\n\nWHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus hailed the speed at which vaccines, diagnostics and treatments were being developed but said more needed to be done.\n\n\"We need to rapidly scale up our clinical trials, manufacturing, licensing and regulation capacity so that these products can get to people and start saving lives,\" he said.\n\n\"Fully financing the ACT-Accelerator would shorten the pandemic and pay back this investment rapidly as the global economy recovers.\"",

            "Text": "US President Donald Trump knew the coronavirus was \"deadly\" and worse than the flu even as he intentionally misled the US public in February and March about the risks, according to a forthcoming book by American journalist Bob Woodward.\n\nTrump said in a recorded conversation with Woodward he has downplayed the risks of the coronavirus all along because he did not want to cause panic, according to a report in The Washington Post.\n\n\"You just breathe the air and that's how it's passed,\" Trump told Woodward in a February 7 telephone call.\n\n\"And so that's a very tricky one. That's a very delicate one. It's also more deadly than even your strenuous flu,\" Trump said.\n\n\"This is deadly stuff,\" the president repeated for emphasis, according to the report.\n\nTrump had learned in an intelligence briefing from his national security advisers on January 28 that the virus presented a serious threat, according to Woodward's book titled Rage and due out on September 15.\n\n\n\n\"This will be the biggest national security threat you face in your presidency,\" Robert O'Brien, the president's national security adviser, told Trump, according to Woodward, who did 18 one-on-one interviews with the president from December 2019 through July 2020.\n\n\"This is going to be the roughest thing you face,\" O'Brien told Trump.After repeated intelligence warnings, Trump downplayed the threat of the virus in public during February and did not sound a public alarm about the risk to the US.\n\n\"We pretty much shut it down coming in from China,\" Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity on February 2.\n\nCritics argue the president's slow response and failure to develop a national strategy to fight the virus has resulted in more deaths than necessary and continuing economic damage from the pandemic.\n\nThe US has suffered more than 190,000 deaths and recorded more than 6.3 million cases of COVID-19, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\n\nAD\nTrump's mishandling of the virus hurt him politically. Trump has fallen behind his Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden in public polls because voters see his response to the pandemic as inadequate.\n\n\"He knew how deadly it was. It was much more deadly than the flu. ... He knew and purposely played it down. Worse, he lied to the American people. He knowingly and willingly lied about the threat it posed to the country for months,\" Biden said during a campaign event in Warren, Michigan on Wednesday.\n\nHouse of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement: \"The president's own words spell out the devastating truth: Trump was fully aware of the catastrophic nature of the coronavirus but hid the facts and refused to take the threat seriously, leaving our entire country exposed and unprepared.\"\n\nNews of Woodward's audio recordings of the president went viral on Wednesday with #TrumpKnew the number one trending hashtag on Twitter worldwide in more than 615,000 tweets, according to the tracking site trends.24.in Trump and his aides previously claimed his slow early reaction to the outbreak was a result of failures by China to warn the world properly.\n\n\"The president never downplayed the virus,\" White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said in a news briefing on Tuesday after the report by The Washington Post.\n\n\"The president has never lied to the public on COVID. The president was expressing calm and his actions reflect that,\" McEnany said.\n\nWoodward's reporting, however, appears to undercut that narrative.\n\n\"I wanted to always play it down,\" Trump told Woodward on March 19.\n\n\"I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic,\" Trump told Woodward in recordings published by The Washington Post. The public alarm was not sounded in the US until February 25 when Dr Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a news briefing the virus was coming.\n\n\"It's not so much of a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen,\" Messonnier said.\n\nUS stock markets tumbled 3 percent on the news that day and Trump, travelling back from India on Air Force One, was angered by the headlines. Messonnier subsequently was sidelined by the White House from further public statements.\n\n\"It's going to disappear. One day, it's like a miracle, it will disappear,\" Trump said publicly as late as February 27.\n\nWoodward's book reveals additional disparaging remarks by Trump about US military leaders, his negotiations with North Korea's Kim Jong Un and his views on the Black Lives Matter protests that have reshaped US politics in the last three months.",

This compares to six percent generally in the Midlands region of England at the time.\n\nTen out of 29 cleaners involved in the study - or 34.5 percent - had antibodies suggesting a previous infection.\n\nThe rates were similar for clinicians working in acute medicine and general internal medicine - 33 percent and 30 percent respectively - while staff working in intensive care had the lowest rates (15 percent, or nine out of 61 participants).\n\nThe authors said it was not clear from their observational study whether the higher rates of infection among some staff \"arises from a greater risk of exposure to the virus, or a greater risk of infection if exposed\".\n\n\"Regardless of the cause, this finding demands urgent further investigation, particularly in view of the ethnic disparities in the outcome from COVID-19,\" they said.\n\nProtecting staff \nA slew of studies in the general population has highlighted how people from minority backgrounds in Britain and the United States are disproportionately more likely to die from COVID-19 than their white counterparts.\n\nLast month a study published in The Lancet Public Health journal found that front-line health workers were more than three times more likely to test positive for the virus than the general population early in the pandemic, with the rate rising to five times for ethnic minority medical staff.\n\nCommenting on the study in Thorax, Tim Cook, an anaesthesia professor at the University of Bristol, said it added to research suggesting those working in intensive care were at lower risk than staff in other parts of a hospital.\n\nHe said the availability and type of PPE could be a factor, as well as familiarity with more rigorous precautions for sterility and infection prevention in emergency rooms.\n\nHe added that recent studies suggested patients were more infectious at the beginning of their illness, so may be less likely to spread the virus by the time that they are treated in intensive care.\n\n\"Those caring for the patients earlier in their illness may be more at risk and this has implications for managing all patient-facing staff on the wards,\" he added.",

On Monday, people at the trade fair crowded around booths showing the potential game-changing vaccines.\n\nIn May, President Xi pledged to make any potential vaccine developed by China a \"global public good\".\n\nThe potential vaccines are among nearly 10 worldwide to enter phase-three trials, typically the last step ahead of regulatory approval, as countries race to stamp out the virus.\n\nSinopharm said it anticipates the antibodies from its jab to last between one and three years - although the final result will only be known after the trials.\n\nChina's state-owned Global Times reported last month that \"the price of the vaccines will not be high\".\n\nEvery two doses should cost below 1,000 yuan ($146), the report said, citing Sinopharm's chairman, who told media he had already been injected with one of the candidate vaccines.\n\nChina's official Xinhua news agency also reported on Monday that another vaccine candidate, developed by Chinese military scientists, was able to deal with mutations in the coronavirus.\n\nAs of last month, at least 5.7 billion doses of the vaccines under development around the world had been pre-ordered.\n\nHowever, the World Health Organization has warned that widespread immunisation against COVID-19 may not be on the cards until the middle of next year.",

            "Text": "As communities in the United States consider how to safely re-open K-12 school buildings and in-person services, CDC offers updated considerations for mitigation strategies that K-12 school administrators can use to help protect students, teachers, and staff and slow the spread of COVID-19.  These updated Considerations for Schools are intended to aid school administrators as they consider how to protect the health, safety, and wellbeing of students, teachers, staff, their families, and communities: \nPromoting behaviors that reduce COVID-19\u2019s spread\nMaintaining healthy environments\nMaintaining healthy operations\nPreparing for when someone gets sick\nSchools should determine, in collaboration with state and local health officials to the extent possible, whether and how to implement each of these considerations while adjusting to meet the unique needs and circumstances of the local community. Implementation should be guided by what is feasible, practical, acceptable, and tailored to the needs of each community. It is also critically important to develop strategies that can be revised and adapted depending on the level of viral transmission in the school and throughout the community and done with close communication with state and/or local public health authorities and recognizing the differences between school districts, including urban, suburban, and rural districts. These considerations are meant to supplement\u2014not replace\u2014any Federal, state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which schools must comply (e.g., Individuals with Disabilities Education Actexternal icon).\n\nSchool-based health facilities may refer to CDC\u2019s Guidance for U.S. Healthcare Facilities and may find it helpful to reference the Ten Ways Healthcare Systems Can Operate Effectively During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Guiding principles to keep in mind\nEveryone\u2019s goal is to prioritize the reopening of schools as safely and as quickly as possible given the many known and established benefits of in-person learning. In order to enable this and assist schools with their day-to-day operations, it is important to adopt and diligently implement actions to slow the spread of COVID-19 inside the school and out in the community. Vigilance to these actions will moderate the risk of in-school transmission regardless of the underlying community burden \u2013 with risk being the lowest if community transmission is low and there is fidelity to implementing proven mitigation strategies.\n\nThe statement The Importance of Reopening America\u2019s Schools this Fall highlights that parents and school leaders are very eager for schools to reopen, but understandably concerned about the health and safety of their children during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nChildren and COVID-19\nIn general, children with COVID-19 are less likely to have severe symptoms than adults or experience an asymptomatic infection \u2013 meaning they do not have any signs or symptoms of disease (1-7).\n\nAnalysis of pediatric COVID-19 hospitalization data from 14 states from early March to late July 2020 found the cumulative rate of COVID-19\u2013associated hospitalization among children was over 20 times lower compared to adults (8.0 versus 164.5 per 100,000 population) (8). Although the cumulative rate is low, one in three children hospitalized with COVID-19 was admitted to an intensive care unit so the risk is not negligible (8). Similarly, the death rate among school-aged children is much lower than the rate among adults (9, 10). Also, the comparatively low risk for hospitalization and death among children themselves must be contextualized to the risk posed to teachers, school administrators, and other staff in the school environment. The risk of teachers, school administrators, and other staff in the school is expected to mirror that of other adults in the community if they contract COVID-19.\n\nTo be sure, the best available evidence from countries that have reopened schools indicates that COVID-19 poses low risks to school-aged children \u2013 at least in areas with low community transmission. That said, the body of evidence is growing that children of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (3-7) and, contrary to early reports (11, 12), might play a role in transmission (7, 13, 14).\n\nThe many benefits of in-person schooling should be weighed against the risks posed by COVID-19 spread. Of key significance, in-person learning is in the best interest of students, when compared to virtual learning. Application and adherence to mitigation measures provided in this document and similar to those implemented at essential workplaces can help schools reopen and stay open safely for in-person learning.\n\nDeciding how to reopen\nSchool officials should make decisions about school reopening based on available data including levels of community transmission and their capacity to implement appropriate mitigation measures in schools to protect students, teachers, administrators, and other staff. Schools should also consider other aspects of students\u2019 risk and wellbeing that arise when schools do not reopen for in-person classes. This includes the potential adverse impacts on students\u2019 social-emotional, behavioral, and mental health, as well as the critical services provided to students to help mitigate health disparities and serve children in need, such as school lunch programs, special education services, after-school programs and mental health services.\n\nThe unique and critical role that schools play makes them a priority for reopening and remaining open, enabling students to receive both academic instruction and enable the provision of other critical services and supports. By strictly implementing mitigation strategies, schools will be able to meet the needs of their students and community, while reducing the risk of COVID-19 spread. Taking actions to lower the risk of COVID-19 spread\nCOVID-19 is mostly spread by respiratory droplets released when people talk, cough, or sneeze. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own eyes, nose, or mouth. Therefore, personal prevention practices (such as handwashing, staying home when sick) and environmental cleaning and disinfection are important principles that are discussed below. Fortunately, there are a number of actions school administrators can take to help lower the risk of COVID-19 exposure and spread during school sessions and activities.\n\nIn order to reach the goal of reopening schools as safely and as quickly as possible for in-person learning, and help schools remain open, it is important to adopt and diligently implement actions to slow the spread of COVID-19 inside the school and out in the community.  This means that students, families, teachers, school staff, and all community members take actions to protect themselves and others where they live, work, learn, and play.\n\nContinuum of risk\nBy model of learning and implementation of proven mitigation strategies\nIn general, the risk of COVID-19 spread in schools increases across the continuum of virtual, hybrid, to in-person learning with the risk moderated for hybrid and in-person learning based upon the range of mitigation strategies put in place and the extent they are conscientiously followed.\n\nWhile not exhaustive, this stratification attempts to characterize the risks of spread among students, teachers, and staff across this continuum:\n\nLowest risk:\n\nStudents and teachers engage in virtual-only classes, activities, and events\nSome risk:\n\nHybrid Learning Model: Some students participate in virtual learning and other students participate in in-person learning\nSmall, in-person classes, activities, and events\nCohorting, alternating schedules, and staggered schedules are applied rigorously\nNo mixing of groups of students and teachers throughout/across school days\nStudents and teachers do not share objects\nStudents, teachers, and staff follow all steps to protect themselves and others at all times including proper use of face masks, social distancing, hand hygiene\nRegularly scheduled (i.e., at least daily or between uses) cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched areas implemented with fidelity\nMedium risk:\n\nHybrid Learning Model: Most students participate in in-person learning, some students participate in virtual learning\nLarger in-person classes, activities, and events\nCohorting, alternating schedules, and staggered schedules are applied with some exceptions\nSome mixing of groups of students and teachers throughout/across school days\nStudents and teachers minimally share objects\nStudents, teachers, and staff follow all steps to protect themselves and others such as proper use of face masks, social distancing, hand hygiene\nRegularly scheduled cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched areas largely implemented with fidelity\nHigher risk:\n\nStudents and teachers engage in in-person only learning, activities, and events\nStudents minimally mix between classes and activities\nStudents and teachers share some objects\nStudents, teachers, and staff follow some steps to protect themselves and others at all times such as proper use of face masks, social distancing, hand hygiene\nIrregular cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched areas\nHighest risk:\n\nStudents and teachers engage in in-person only learning, activities, and events\nStudents mix freely between classes and activities\nStudents and teachers freely share objects\nStudents, teachers, and staff do not/are not required to follow steps to protect themselves and others such as proper use of face masks, social distancing, hand hygiene\nIrregular cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched areas Plan and prepare\nEmergency operations plans: review, update, and implement EOPs\nThe most important actions for school administrators to take before reopening in-person services and facilities are planning and preparing. To best prepare, schools should expect that students, teachers, or staff may contract symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and schools must know what to do when this happens. Regardless of the number of cases in a community, every school should have a plan in place to protect staff, children, and their families from the spread of COVID-19 and a response plan in place for if/when a student, teacher, or staff member tests positive for COVID-19. This plan should be developed in collaboration with state and local public health departments; school nurses, parents, caregivers, and guardians; student leaders; community members; and other relevant partners. Schools should prioritize EOP components that address infectious disease outbreaks and their consequences.\n\nReference key resources on emergency preparedness while reviewing, updating, and implementing the EOP.\nMultiple federal agencies have developed resources on school planning principles and a 6-step processpdf iconexternal icon for creating plans to build and continually foster safe and healthy school communities before, during, and after possible emergencies.\nThe Readiness and Emergency Management for Schools (REMS) Technical Assistance Center\u2019s websiteexternal icon contains free resources, trainings, and technical assistance (TA) for schools and their community partners, including many tools and resources on emergency planning and response to infectious disease outbreaks. Schools may find these considerations are helpful for developing high-quality emergency operations plans.\nSchool nurses, teachers, staff, parents, student leaders, and other community stakeholders (e.g., youth service organizations, health centers, etc.) should be involved in the development of the Emergency Operations Plans (EOP). Some of the strategies school administrators should consider while developing their EOP:\n\nDevelop a protocol for monitoring local COVID-19 data in your community to keep track of the level of community transmission, to make decisions about changes to mitigation strategies, and to help determine whether school closures may be necessary. This should include daily review of official public health data for the community surrounding the school. Contact the state, local, tribal, or territorial Public Health Department for references to local COVID-19 data.\nDevelop and test information-sharing systems (e.g., school-to-parent email or texting protocols, periodic virtual meetings with parent/teachers, etc.) with school and community partners and key stakeholders. Use institutional information systems for day-to-day reporting on information that can help to detect and respond to an outbreak, such as number of cases and absenteeism or changes in the number of visits to the health center by students, teachers, and other staff.\nAdopt mitigation strategies to promote healthy behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19, maintain healthy school environments and operations, and plan what to do if a student, teacher, or staff member gets sick.\nExamine the accessibility of information and resources to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and maintain healthy environments and determine whether they are culturally relevant, in plain language, and available in appropriate languages and accessible formats.\nIn consultation with local officials, establish transparent criteria for when the school will suspend in-person learning to stop or slow the spread of COVID-19, as well as transparent criteria for when to resume in-person learning.\nAssess students\u2019 special needs (such as continuing education, meal programs, and other services) and develop strategies to address these needs if in-person learning is suspended or if a student needs to self-isolate as a result of a diagnosis of or exposure to COVID-19.\nEnsure the EOP takes into consideration students with disabilities, students with special healthcare needs, students experiencing homelessness, migrant students and those with English learners, etc. Promote behaviors that reduce spread of COVID-19\n\nSchools may consider implementing several strategies to encourage behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19.\n\nStaying home when appropriate\n\nEducate staff and families about when they/their child(ren) should stay home and when they can return to school.\n\nActively encourage employees and students who are sick or who have recently had close contact (less than 6 feet for fifteen minutes or more) with a person with COVID-19 to stay home. Develop policies that encourage sick employees and students to stay at home without fear of reprisal, and ensure employees, students, and students\u2019 families are aware of these policies. Consider not assessing schools based on absenteeism, and offering virtual learning and telework options, if feasible.\nStaff and students should stay home if they have tested positive for or are showing COVID-19 symptoms.\nStaff and students who have recently had close contact with a person with COVID-19 should also stay home and monitor their health.\nCDC\u2019s criteria can help inform when employees should return to work:\nIf they have been sick with COVID-19\nIf they have recently had close contact with a person with COVID-19\nHand hygiene and respiratory etiquette\n\nTeach and reinforce handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and increase monitoring to ensure adherence among students and staff.\nEncourage staff and students to cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Used tissues should be thrown in the trash and hands washed immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\nIf soap and water are not readily available, hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol should be used (for staff and older children who can safely use hand sanitizer).\nMasks\n\nTeach and reinforce use of masks. The use of masks is one of many important mitigation strategies to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Masks are meant to protect other people in case the wearer is unknowingly infected but does not have symptoms. Masks are not Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (e.g., surgical masks, respirators).\nAppropriate and consistent use of masks is most important when students, teachers, and staff are indoors and when social distancing is difficult to implement or maintain. Individuals should be frequently reminded not to touch the face covering or mask and to wash their hands or use hand sanitizer frequently. Information should be provided to staff, students, and students\u2019 families on proper use, removal, and washing of masks.\nMasks should not be placed on:\nChildren younger than 2 years old\nAnyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious\nAnyone who is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance\nAppropriate and consistent use of masks may be challenging for some students, teachers, and staff, including:\nYounger students, such as those in early elementary school (Pre-K through 3rd grade).\nStudents, teachers, and staff with severe asthma or other breathing difficulties.\nStudents, teachers, and staff with special educational or healthcare needs, including intellectual and developmental disabilities, mental health conditions, and sensory concerns or tactile sensitivity.\nWhile masks are strongly encouraged to reduce the spread of COVID-19, CDC recognizes there are specific instances when wearing a mask may not be feasible. In these instances, parents, guardians, caregivers, teachers, staff, and school administrators should consider adaptations and alternatives whenever possible. They may need to consult with healthcare providers for advice about wearing masks.\nPeople who are deaf or hard of hearing\u2014or those who care for or interact with a person who is hearing impaired\u2014may be unable to wear masks if they rely on lipreading to communicate. This may be particularly relevant for faculty or staff teaching or working with students who may be deaf or hard of hearing. In this situation, consider using a clear mask that covers the nose and wraps securely around the face. If a clear mask isn\u2019t available, consider whether faculty and staff can use written communication (including closed captioning) and decrease background noise to improve communication while wearing a mask that blocks your lips.\nMasks are recommended as a simple barrier to help prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air and onto other people when the person wearing the mask coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice. This is called source control.\nIn addition to those who interact with people who are deaf or hard of hearing, the following groups of teachers and staff may also consider using clear masks:\nTeachers of young students (e.g., teaching young students to read).\nTeachers of students who are English language learners\nTeachers of students with disabilities\nClear masks should be determined not to cause any breathing difficulties or over heating for the wearer. Clear masks are not face shields. CDC does not recommend use of face shields for normal everyday activities or as a substitute for masks because of a lack of evidence of their effectiveness to control the spread of the virus from the source for source control.\nAdequate supplies\n\nSupport healthy hygiene behaviors by providing adequate supplies, including soap and water, hand sanitizer with at least 60%  alcohol (for staff and older children who can safely use hand sanitizer), paper towels, tissues, disinfectant wipes, masks (as feasible) and no-touch/foot-pedal trash cans.\n\nSigns and messages\n\nPost signs in highly visible locations (e.g., school entrances, restrooms) that promote everyday protective measurespdf icon and describe how to stop the spreadpdf icon of germs (such as by properly washing hands and properly wearing a maskimage icon). Signs should include visual cues (such as clear, easy-to-understand pictures demonstrating the healthy behaviors) at the appropriate reading and literacy level.\nBroadcast regular announcements on reducing the spread of COVID-19 on PA systems.\nUse simple, clear, and effective language about behaviors that prevent spread of COVID-19 when communicating with staff and families (such as on school websites, in emails, and through school social media accounts). If feasible, provide communication in multiple languages.\nUse communication methods that are accessible for all students, faculty, and staff, including those with disabilities.\nTranslate materials into common languages spoken by students, faculty, and staff and people in the school community.\nFind freely available CDC print and digital resources on CDC\u2019s communications resources main page. CDC also has American Sign Language videos related to COVID-19 and other communication tools. Maintaining healthy environments\n\nSchool administrators may consider implementing several strategies to maintain healthy environments.\n\nCleaning and disinfection\n\nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (e.g., playground equipment, door handles, sink handles, drinking fountains) within the school and on school buses at least daily or between use as much as possible. Use of shared objects (e.g., gym or physical education equipment, art supplies, toys, games) should be limited when possible, or cleaned between use.\nDevelop a schedule for increased frequency of routine cleaning and disinfection.\nIf transport vehicles (e.g., buses) are used by the school, drivers should practice all safety actions and protocols as indicated for other staff (e.g., hand hygiene, masks). To clean and disinfect school buses or other transport vehicles, see guidance for bus transit operators.\nDevelop a schedule for increased, routine cleaning and disinfection.\nEnsure safe and correct use and storage of cleaning and disinfection productsexternal icon, including storing products securely away from children. Use products that meet EPA disinfection criteriaexternal icon.\nCleaning products should not be used near children, and staff should ensure that there is adequate ventilation when using these products to prevent children or themselves from inhaling toxic fumes.\nShared objects\n\nDiscourage sharing of items that are difficult to clean or disinfect.\nKeep each child\u2019s belongings separated from others\u2019 and in individually labeled containers, cubbies, or areas.\nEnsure adequate supplies to minimize sharing of high touch materials to the extent possible (e.g., assigning each student their own art supplies, equipment) or limit use of supplies and equipment by one group of children at a time and clean and disinfect between use.\nAvoid sharing electronic devices, toys, books, and other games or learning aids.\nVentilation\n\nConsider ventilation system upgrades or improvements and other steps to increase the delivery of clean air and dilute potential contaminants in the school. Obtain consultation from experienced Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) professionals when considering changes to HVAC systems and equipment.  Some of the recommendations below are based on the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Guidance for Building Operations During the COVID-19 Pandemicexternal icon. Review additional ASHRAE guidelines for schools and universitiespdf iconexternal icon for further information on ventilation recommendations for different types of buildings and building readiness for occupancy. Not all steps are applicable for all scenarios.\n\nImprovement steps may include some or all of the following activities:\n\nIncrease outdoor air ventilation, using caution in highly polluted areas.\nWhen weather conditions allow, increase fresh outdoor air by opening windows and doors. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk (e.g., risk of falling, triggering asthma symptoms) to children using the facility.\nUse fans to increase the effectiveness of open windows.  Position fans securely and carefully in or near windows so as not to induce potentially contaminated airflow directly from one person over another (strategic window fan placement in exhaust mode can help draw fresh air into room via other open windows and doors without generating strong room air currents).\nDecrease occupancy in areas where outdoor ventilation cannot be increased.\nEnsure ventilation systems operate properly and provide acceptable indoor air quality for the current occupancy level for each space.\nIncrease total airflow supply to occupied spaces, when possible.\nDisable demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) controls that reduce air supply based on occupancy or temperature during occupied hours.\nFurther open minimum outdoor air dampers to reduce or eliminate HVAC air recirculation. In mild weather, this will not affect thermal comfort or humidity. However, this may be difficult to do in cold, hot, or humid weather.\nImprove central air filtration:\nIncrease air filtrationexternal icon to as high as possible without significantly diminishing design airflow.\nInspect filter housing and racks to ensure appropriate filter fit and check for ways to minimize filter bypass\nCheck filters to ensure they are within service life and appropriately installed.\nConsider running the HVAC system at maximum outside airflow for 2 hours before and after the school is occupied.\nEnsure restroom exhaust fans are functional and operating at full capacity when the school is occupied.\nInspect and maintain local exhaust ventilation in areas such as restrooms, kitchens, cooking areas, etc.\nUse portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) fan/filtration systems to help enhance air cleaning (especially in higher risk areas such as the nurse\u2019s office).\nInspect and maintain local exhaust ventilation in areas such as bathrooms, kitchens, cooking areas, etc.\nUse portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) fan/filtration systems to help enhance air cleaning (especially in higher risk areas such as nurse\u2019s office and special education classrooms).\nGenerate clean-to-less-clean air movement by re-evaluating the positioning of supply and exhaust air diffusers and/or dampers (especially in higher risk areas such as the nurse\u2019s office).\nConsider using ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) as a supplement to help inactivate SARS-CoV-2, especially if options for increasing room ventilation are limited.\nVentilation considerations are also important on school buses.\n*Note: The ventilation intervention considerations listed above come with a range of initial costs and operating costs which, along with risk assessment parameters such as community incidence rates, facemask compliance expectations and classroom density, may affect considerations for which interventions are implemented.  Acquisition cost estimates (per room) for the listed ventilation interventions range from $0.00 (opening a window; inspecting and maintain local exhaust ventilation; disabling DCV controls; or repositioning outdoor air dampers) to <$100 (using fans to increase effectiveness of open windows; or repositioning supply/exhaust diffusers to create directional airflow) to approx. $500 (adding portable HEPA fan/filter systems) to approx. $1500 (adding upper room UVGI).\n\nWater systems\n\nThe temporary shutdown or reduced operation of schools and reductions in normal water use can create hazards for returning students and staff. To minimize the risk of lead or copper exposure, Legionnaire\u2019s disease, and other diseases associated with water, take steps such as plumbing flushing to ensure that all water systems and features (e.g., sink faucets, drinking fountains, showers, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown, and follow EPA\u2019s 3Ts, (Training, Testing, and Taking Action) for reducing lead in drinking waterexternal icon. It may be necessary to conduct ongoing regular flushing after reopening. For additional resources, refer to EPA\u2019s Information on Maintaining or Restoring Water Quality in Buildings with Low or No Useexternal icon. Drinking fountains should be cleaned and sanitized.\n\nModified layouts\n\nSpace seating/desks at least 6 feet apart when feasible.\nTurn desks to face in the same direction (rather than facing each other), or have students sit on only one side of tables, spaced apart.\nModify learning stations and activities as applicable so there are fewer students per group, placed at least 6 feet apart if possible.\nCreate distance between children on school buses (g., seat children one child per row, skip rows) when possible.\nPhysical barriers and guides\n\nInstall physical barriers, such as sneeze guards and partitions, particularly in areas where it is difficult for individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart (e.g., reception desks).\nProvide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls, to ensure that staff and children remain at least 6 feet apart in lines and at other times (e.g. guides for creating \u201cone way routes\u201d in hallways).\nCommunal spaces\n\nClose communal use shared spaces such as dining halls and playgrounds with shared playground equipment if possible; otherwise, stagger use and clean and disinfect between use.\nAdd physical barriers, such as plastic flexible screens, between bathroom sinks especially when they cannot be at least 6 feet apart.\nFood service\n\nSchools are essential to meeting the nutritional needs of children with many consuming up to half their daily calories at school. Nationwide more than 30 million children participate in the National School Lunch Program and nearly 15 million participate in the School Breakfast Program. (15, 16) There are several mitigation strategies that schools may implement while providing this critical service to their students.\nAvoid offering any self-serve food or drink options, such as hot and cold food bars, salad or condiment bars, and drink stations. Serve individually plated or pre-packaged meals instead, while ensuring the safety of children with food allergiespdf icon.\nAs feasible, have children eat meals outdoors or in classrooms, while maintaining social distance (at least 6 feet apart) as much as possible, instead of in a communal dining hall or cafeteria.\nHave teachers and children wash their hands with soap and water for 20 seconds or use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol before and after eating. Ensure children do not share food, either brought from home or from the food service.\nIf communal dining halls or cafeterias will be used, ensure that children remain at least 6 feet apart in food service lines and at tables while eating. Clean and disinfect tables and chairs between each use.\nEnsure children do not share food or utensils. This helps prevent the spread of COVID-19 for all students and helps ensure the safety of children with food allergiespdf icon:\nUse disposable food service items (e.g., utensils, trays).\nIf disposable items are not feasible or desirable, ensure that all non-disposable food service items and equipment are handled by staff with gloves and washed with dish soap and hot water or in a dishwasher.\nIndividuals should wash their hands after removing their gloves or after directly handling used food service items.\nIf food is offered at any event, have pre-packaged boxes or bags for each attendee instead of a buffet or family-style meal.\nProvide tissues and no-touch or foot pedal trash cans, where possible, for employees, volunteers, and students to use.\nIf possible, install touchless payment methods (pay without touching money, a card, or a keypad). Provide hand sanitizer right after handling money, cards, or keypads.\nOf Note: USDA has issued the COVID-19 Nationwide Waiver to Allow Meal Pattern Flexibility in the Child Nutrition Programsexternal icon. Maintaining healthy operations\n\nSchools may consider implementing several strategies to maintain healthy operations.\n\nProtections for staff and children at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19\n\nOffer options for staff at higher risk for severe illness (including older adults and people of all ages with certain underlying medical conditions or disabilities) that limit their exposure risk (e.g., telework, modified job responsibilities that limit exposure risk).\nOffer options for students at higher risk of severe illness that limit their exposure risk (e.g., virtual learning opportunities).\nProvide inclusive programming for children and youth with special healthcare needs and disabilities that allows on-site or virtual participation with appropriate accommodations, modifications, and assistance (e.g., students with disabilities may have more difficulties accessing and using technology for virtual learning).\nConsistent with applicable law, put in place policies to protect the privacy of people at higher risk for severe illness regarding underlying medical conditions.\nRegulatory awareness\n\nBe aware of local or state regulatory agency policies related to group gatherings to determine if events can be held.\n\nIdentifying small groups and keeping them together (cohorting or podding)\n\nDividing students and teachers into distinct groups that stay together throughout an entire school day during in-person classroom instruction. Limit mixing between groups such that there is minimal or no interaction between cohorts.\n\nAlternating schedule\n\nAlternate the days when cohorts physically attend school. For example, certain grades or classrooms physically attend school on Monday/Tuesday and other grades or classrooms physically attend on Thursday/Friday (and the school is thoroughly cleaned in between, on Wednesday). As another example, some schools internationally have rotated in-person attendance weekly with one group of students attending during a week, followed by a different group the next week in rotation with thorough cleaning on the weekends.\n\nStaggered scheduling\n\nStagger student arrival, drop-off, and pick-up time or locations by cohort, or put in place other protocols to limit contact between cohorts and direct contact with parents, guardians, and caregivers as much as possible.\nWhen possible, use flexible worksites (e.g., telework at home) and flexible work hours (e.g., staggered shifts) to help establish policies and practices for social distancing (staying at least 6 feet apart).\nMix of virtual learning and in-class learning (hybrid schedule)\n\nHybrid options can apply a cohort approach to the in-class education provided.\n\nVirtual/at-home only\n\nStudents and teachers engage in virtual-only classes, activities, and events.\n\nGatherings, visitors, and field trips\n\nPursue virtual group events, gatherings, or meetings, if possible, and promote social distancing of at least 6 feet between people if events are held. Limit group size to the extent possible.\nPursue options to convene sporting events and participate in sports activities in ways that reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to players, families, coaches, and communities.\nLimit any nonessential visitors, volunteers, and activities involving external groups or organizations as possible \u2013 especially with individuals who are not from the local geographic area (e.g., community, town, city, county).\nLimit cross-school transfer for special programs. For example, if students are brought from multiple schools for special programs (e.g., music, robotics, academic clubs, sports), consider using distance learning and virtual environments to deliver the instruction or temporarily offering duplicate programs in the participating schools.  For youth sports considerations visit the FAQs for Youth Sports Programs (e.g., physical distance, wearing masks, etc.).\nDevelop a plan for staff who travel between schools (e.g., school nurses, psychologists, therapists). For example, consider allowing them to have virtual meetings in place of physical school visits and revise scheduling to limit their visits to multiple campuses.\nPursue virtual activities and events in lieu of field trips, student assemblies, special performances, school-wide parent meetings, and spirit nights, as possible.\nDesignated COVID-19 point of contact\n\nDesignate a staff person, such as the school nurse, to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns. All school staff and families should know who this person is and how to contact them.\n\nTravel and transit\n\nConsider options for limiting non-essential travel in accordance with state and local regulations and guidance.\nConsider postponing or canceling upcoming student international travel programs.\nEncourage students, faculty and staff who use public transportation or ride sharing to use forms of transportation that minimize close contact with others (e.g., biking, walking, driving or riding by car either alone or with household members).\nEnsure options for safe travel on campus for people with disabilities. For example, social distancing in designated seating areas for wheelchairs may not be possible and drivers who may need to have close contact to assist a person with disabilities.\nEncourage students, faculty and staff who use public transportation or ride sharing to follow CDC guidance on how to protect yourself when using Additionally, encourage them to commute during less busy times and clean their hands as soon as possible after their trip.\nParticipation in community response efforts\n\nConsider participating with local authorities in broader COVID-19 community response efforts (e.g., sitting on community response committees).\n\nCommunication systems\n\nPut systems in place for:\n\nStaff and families should self-report to the school if they or their student have symptoms of COVID-19, a positive test for COVID-19, or were exposed to someone with COVID-19 within the last 14 days. The reporting system should be consistent with the health information sharing regulations for COVID-19external icon (e.g. see \u201cNotify Health Officials and Close Contacts\u201d in the Preparing for When Someone Gets Sick section below) and other applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and confidentiality, such as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). The communication methods should be accessible for all students, faculty and staff, including those with disabilities and limited English proficiency (e.g., use interpreters and translated materials)\nNotifying staff, families, and the public of school closures and any restrictions in place to limit COVID-19 exposure (e.g., limited hours of operation).\nLeave (time off) policies and excused absence policies\n\nImplement flexible sick leave policies and practices that enable staff to stay home when they are sick, have been exposed, or caring for someone who is sick.\nExamine and revise policies for leave, telework, and employee compensation.\nLeave policies should be flexible and not punish people for taking time off and should allow sick employees to stay home and away from co-workers. Leave policies should also account for employees who need to stay home with their children if there are school or childcare closures, or to care for sick family members.  Additional flexibilities might include giving advances on future sick leave days and allowing employees to donate sick leave to each other, for example.\nDevelop policies for return-to-school after COVID-19 illness. CDC\u2019s criteria to discontinue home isolation and quarantine can inform these policies.\nBack-up staffing plan\n\nMonitor absenteeism of students and employees, cross-train staff, and create a roster of trained back-up staff.\n\nStaff training\n\nTrain staff on all safety protocols.\nConduct training virtually or ensure that social distancing is maintained during training.\nRecognize signs and symptoms\n\nWe learn more about COVID-19 every day, and as more information becomes available, CDC will continue to update and share information. As our knowledge and understanding of COVID-19 evolves, this guidance may change.\n\nBased on the best available evidence at this time:\n\nCDC does not currently recommend universal symptom screenings (screening all students grades K-12) be conducted by schools.\nParents or caregivers should be strongly encouraged to monitor their children for signs of infectious illness including COVID-19 every day.\nStudents who have symptoms of any infectious illness or symptoms consistent with COVID-19 should not attend school in-person.\nThe profile of symptoms associated with COVID-19 remains under study and will be updated as warranted by research findings. Further information on what symptoms may suggest infectious illness and recommended return-to-school policies is available at Screening K-12 Students for Symptoms of COVID-19: Limitations and Considerations.\nSchools that choose to conduct symptom screening should conduct these screenings safely and respectfully, and in accordance with any applicable privacy laws and regulations (e.g., confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act [FERPA]).\nThe considerations detailed here are intended only for students in K-12 school settings. For guidance related to screening of staff, please refer to CDC\u2019s Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers Responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 and the Prevent Transmission Among Employees section of CDC\u2019s Resuming Business Toolkitpdf icon.\nSharing facilities\n\nEncourage any organizations that share or use the school facilities to also follow these considerations.\n\nSupport coping and resilience \n\nEncourage employees and students to take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories about COVID-19, including social media if they are feeling overwhelmed or distressed.\nPromote employees and students eating healthy, exercising, getting sleep, and finding time to unwind.\nEncourage employees and students to talk with people they trust about their concerns and how they are feeling.\nTransparently communicate with staff, teachers, students, and families, including about mental health support services available at the school. These critical communications should be accessible to individuals with disabilities and limited English proficiency.\nShare facts about COVID-19 regularly through trusted sources of information to counter the spread of misinformation and mitigate fear.\nConsider posting signages for the national distress hotline: 1-800-985-5990, or text TalkWithUsto 66746\nEnsure continuity of mental health services, such as offering remote counseling.\nEncourage students to call 911 or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255), 1-888-628-9454 for Spanish, or Lifeline Crisis Chatexternal icon if they are feeling overwhelmed with emotions such as sadness, depression, anxiety, or feel like wanting to harm themselves or others. Prepare for when someone is sick with COVID-19\n\nSchools may consider implementing several strategies to prepare for when someone is sick with COVID-19.\n\nAdvise staff and families of students sick with COVID-19 of home isolation criteria\n\nSick staff members or students should not return until they have met CDC\u2019s criteria to discontinue home isolation.\n\nMake sure that staff and families know when they should stay home\n\nMake sure that staff and families know that they (staff) or their children (families) should not come to school, and that they should notify school officials (e.g., the designated COVID-19 point of contact [e.g., school nurse]) if they (staff) or their child (families) test positive for COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 symptoms or a confirmed or suspected case. These critical communications should be accessible to individuals with disabilities and limited English proficiency.\n\nIsolate and transport students who develop symptoms while at school\n\nSome students may develop symptoms of infectious illness while at school. Schools should take action to isolate students who develop these symptoms from other students and staff. Follow the school isolation protocol outlined in Screening K-12 Students for Symptoms of COVID-19: Limitations and Considerations when student develops symptoms of an infectious illness.\n\nClean and disinfect\n\nClose off areas used by a sick person and do not use these areas until after cleaning and disinfecting them. For outdoor areas (e.g., playgrounds, sitting areas, outdoor eating areas, etc.), this includes surfaces or shared objects in the area, if applicable.\nWait at least 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible. Ensure safe and correct use and storage of cleaning and disinfection productsexternal icon, including storing products securely away from children.\nNotify health officials and close contacts\n\nIn accordance with state and local laws and regulations, school administrators should notify local health officials, staff, and families immediately of any case of COVID-19 while maintaining confidentiality in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)external icon and FERPAexternal icon or and other applicable laws and regulations.\nInform those who have had close contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19 to stay home and self-monitor for symptoms, and follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop. Maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)external icon and Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) or and other applicable laws and regulations.\nA school might need to implement short-term building closure procedures if/when an infected person has been on campus during their infectious period and has close contact with others. If this happens, work with local public health officials to determine next steps. One option is an initial short-term class suspension and cancellation of events and activities (e.g., assemblies, spirit nights, field trips, and sporting events) to allow time for local health officials to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation and help the school determine appropriate next steps, including whether such a suspension needs to be extended to stop or slow further spread of COVID-19.  In situations where schools are cohorting students (e.g., in pods) administrators may choose to close the building in places (e.g., classrooms, common areas) where others were exposed to the infected person. In the event that local health officials do not recommend building or classroom closures, thoroughly cleaning the areas where the infected person spent significant time should be considered.\nLocal health officials\u2019 recommendations whether to suspend school or events and the duration such suspensions should be made on a case-by-case basis using the most up-to-date information about COVID-19 and taking into account local case-counts, and the degree of ongoing transmission in the community. Students with disabilities or special healthcare needs\nPlan for accommodations, modifications, and assistance for children and youth with disabilities and special healthcare needs\n\nA customized and individualized approach for COVID-19 may be needed for children and youth with disabilities who have limited mobility; have difficulty accessing information due to visual, hearing, or other limiting factors; require close contact with direct service providers; have trouble understanding information; have difficulties with changes in routines; or have other concerns related to their disability. This approach should account for the following:\n\nEducation should remain accessible for children in special education who have a 504 Plan or Individualized Education Program.\nSocial distancing and isolating at school may be difficult for many people with disabilities.\nWearing masks may be difficult for people with certain disabilities (e.g., visual or hearing impairments) or for those with sensory, cognitive, or behavioral issues.\nStudents may require assistance or visual and verbal reminders to cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when they cough or sneeze, throw the tissue in the trash, and wash their hands afterwards.\nWhere service or therapy animals are used, use guidance to protect the animal from COVID-19.\nCleaning and disinfecting procedures may negatively affect students with sensory or respiratory issues.\nStudents may require assistance or supervision washing their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using a hand sanitizer (containing at least 60% alcohol).\nCleaning and disinfecting personal belongings, school objects, or surfaces may require assistance or supervision.\nBehavioral techniques can help all students, adjust to changes in routines and take preventive actions. These techniques may be especially beneficial for some children with disabilities and may include modeling and reinforcing desired behaviors and using picture schedules, timers, and visual cues. Organizations that support individuals with disabilities have information and resources to help schools with these behavioral techniques. In addition, behavioral therapists or local mental health or behavioral health agencies may be able to provide consultation for specific concerns.\nFollow guidance for Direct Service Providers (DSPs)\n\nDirect Service Providers (personal care attendants, direct support professionals, paraprofessionals, therapists, and others) provide a variety of home and community-based, health-related services that support individuals with disabilities. Services provided may include assistance with activities of daily living, access to health services, and more. DSPs are essential for the health and well-being of the individuals they serve.\n\nAsk Direct Service Providers (DSPs) before they enter school if they are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19 or if they have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19. If DSPs provide services in other schools, ask specifically whether any of the other schools have had positive cases. For guidance related to screening of staff (to include DSPs), please refer to CDC\u2019s Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers Responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 and the Prevent Transmission Among Employees section of CDC\u2019s Resuming Business Toolkitpdf icon.\nIf there is potential that a DSP may be splashed or sprayed by bodily fluids during their work, they should use standard precautions to avoid getting infected. They will need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) including a facemask, eye protection, disposable gloves, and a gown.\nCDC has developed guidance for DSPs. School administrators should review the DSP guidance and ensure that DSPs needing to enter the school are aware of those preventive actions.",

            "Text": "Introduction\nInformation sharing among international and national stakeholders during the ongoing COVID-19 response is critical for a coordinated response. Emergency Management Systems Integration (EMSI) is the process of bringing together the public health programs, emergency management systems, and best practices into one cohesive system to enhance the prevention, detection and response to public health events. EMSI supports the coordination of information flow and resource sharing among the disaster management authorities, multisectoral ministries and external partners responding to COVID-19. This involves integrating and streamlining existing \u2014 often disparate \u2014 public health systems in such a way that focuses on increasing the effectiveness of a public health preparedness and response program before, during, and after a public health event to ensure optimal response decision-making and strategy.\n\nThis document aims to provide critical COVID-19 information metrics by technical area that response leaders in non-U.S. settings can request to aid in informing COVID-19 response decisions. This document includes a set of core metrics within 10 technical areas for response leaders to help monitor response progress and guide decision making.   This list was drawn from World Health Organization (WHO) and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 guidance documents with consultation from the CDC Operations and International Task Force subject matter experts in the corresponding technical areas.1-12 This document is not meant to be exhaustive but to identify those information metrics that are critical to inform response leadership.

            "Text": "In the spring of 2009, a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged. It was detected first in the United States and spread quickly across the United States and the world. This new H1N1 virus contained a unique combination of influenza genes not previously identified in animals or people. This virus was designated as influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus. Ten years later work continues to better understand influenza, prevent disease, and prepare for the next pandemic. The 2009 H1N1 Pandemic: A New Flu Virus Emerges\nThe (H1N1)pdm09 virus was very different from H1N1 viruses that were circulating at the time of the pandemic. Few young people had any existing immunity (as detected by antibody response) to the (H1N1)pdm09 virus, but nearly one-third of people over 60 years old had antibodies against this virus, likely from exposure to an older H1N1 virus earlier in their lives. Since the (H1N1)pdm09 virus was very different from circulating H1N1 viruses, vaccination with seasonal flu vaccines offered little cross-protection against (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. While a monovalent (H1N1)pdm09 vaccine was produced, it was not available in large quantities until late November\u2014after the peak of illness during the second wave had come and gone in the United States. From April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010, CDC estimated there were 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (range: 195,086-402,719), and 12,469 deaths (range: 8868-18,306) in the United States due to the (H1N1)pdm09 virus. Additionally, CDC estimated that 151,700-575,400 people worldwide died from (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection during the first year the virus circulated.** Globally, 80 percent of (H1N1)pdm09 virus-related deaths were estimated to have occurred in people younger than 65 years of age. This differs greatly from typical seasonal influenza epidemics, during which about 70 percent to 90 percent of deaths are estimated to occur in people 65 years and older.\n\nThough the 2009 flu pandemic primarily affected children and young and middle-aged adults, the impact of the (H1N1)pdm09 virus on the global population during the first year was less severe than that of previous pandemics. Estimates of pandemic influenza mortality ranged from 0.03 percent of the world\u2019s population during the 1968 H3N2 pandemic to 1 percent to 3 percent of the world\u2019s population during the 1918 H1N1 pandemic. It is estimated that 0.001 percent to 0.007 percent of the world\u2019s population died of respiratory complications associated with (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection during the first 12 months the virus circulated.\n\nThe United States mounted a complex, multi-faceted and long-term response to the pandemic, summarized in The 2009 H1N1 Pandemic: Summary Highlights, April 2009-April 2010. On August 10, 2010, WHO declared an end to the global 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. However, (H1N1)pdm09 virus continues to circulate as a seasonal flu virus, and cause illness, hospitalization, and deaths worldwide every year.",

Although there is not universal consensus regarding where the virus originated, it spread worldwide during 1918-1919.  In the United States, it was first identified in military personnel in spring 1918. It is estimated that about 500 million people or one-third of the world\u2019s population became infected with this virus. The number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide with about 675,000 occurring in the United States. Mortality was high in people younger than 5 years old, 20-40 years old, and 65 years and older. The high mortality in healthy people, including those in the 20-40 year age group, was a unique feature of this pandemic. While the 1918 H1N1 virus has been synthesized and evaluated, the properties that made it so devastating are not well understood. With no vaccine to protect against influenza infection and no antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections that can be associated with influenza infections, control efforts worldwide were limited to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as isolation, quarantine, good personal hygiene, use of disinfectants, and limitations of public gatherings, which were applied unevenly.",

The 2009 H1N1 pandemic was estimated to be associated with 151,700 to 575,400 deaths worldwide during the first year it circulated. [1] This H1N1 virus has continued to circulate seasonally to this day. CDC and its many partners have made great strides in the fields of influenza surveillance, prevention, and treatment since 2009, benefiting both the annual response to seasonal flu epidemics, as well as the global capacity to respond to the next pandemic. Key improvements are summarized on the pages below. Gene sequencing technology\nTest tubes\nDuring the pandemic, owing in part to the preparedness work done prior to 2009, CDC and public health laboratories were able to use molecular testing technology, \u201cwith its pinpoint accuracy and revolutionary speed\u201d [2] to detect cases, and monitor the spread of the virus and its characteristics, including watching for emerging drug resistance, for example. In the wake of the 2009 pandemic, numerous retrospective analyses deemed the use of this technology to be one of the response\u2019s key successes [3].\n\nSince the pandemic, CDC\u2019s ability to map the complete influenza virus genome has improved exponentially, thanks to considerable leaps forward in gene sequencing technology, sometimes referred to as Next Generation Sequencing or Advanced Molecular Detection (AMD) technology. Where previous technologies revealed the genes of the predominant influenza virus in a respiratory specimen, it\u2019s now possible to see the gene sequences of all of the influenza particles in a single specimen, thereby giving deeper insight into how influenza viruses may change, for example, by mutating inside a single patient to become resistant to antiviral drugs.\n\nIn 2012 CDC\u2019s influenza laboratory transitioned from a characterization-first approach to a sequence-first approach so now all flu viruses undergo full sequencing as a first step when they arrive at CDC. This change has reduced public health response time to flu outbreaks and also served to greatly expand the global repositories of influenza gene sequence data. Meanwhile, ongoing technological improvements by device manufacturers and CDC\u2019s innovative protocols have brought the gene sequencing cost per virus down from about $180.00 in 2012 to $25.00 per virus in 2019, with additional improvements in the works to bring the cost down even further.\n\nIn 2009, CDC sequenced influenza virus genomes primarily for the identification of vaccine reference viruses. Now, CDC performs \u201cnext generation sequencing\u201d on close to 7,000 influenza viruses annually, and has submitted more than 30,000 flu virus genomes to public databases. Influenza public health laboratory tests\nRT-PCR nce 2009, the widespread adoption by public health laboratories of the testing technique called \u201creal-time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction\u201d (rRT-PCR) with CDC\u2019s flu rRT-PCR test kits has directly enhanced the nation\u2019s pandemic preparedness in a number of ways. For one, widespread use of both has led to standardization of influenza testing across the nation\u2019s public health laboratories. Relative to the other diagnostic methods widely used by laboratories to reveal the type and subtype of flu virus in a sample, rRT-PCR produces more-reliable results, and produces those results faster than most other laboratory techniques. [4]\n\nCDC\u2019s primary rRT-PCR test for influenza viruses (called the \u2018CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel\u2019) is an internationally recognized reference method for detection of influenza. This means the performance of other detection methods is often measured against the performance of CDC\u2019s rRT-PCR flu test.\n\nThe adaptability of the rRT-PCR test allows laboratories to quickly adjust how specimens are processed in outbreak and pandemic situations to avoid backlogs and unnecessary use of resources. CDC provides algorithms that help to ensure that as more specimens are tested, reagents are conserved, thereby maximizing their public health benefit and further reducing the possibility of supply shortages.\n\nAlthough laboratories have the option of using other rRT-PCR tests, use of the CDC test in lieu of commercially manufactured rRT-PCR tests takes the pressure off individual laboratories of ensuring their tests are able to detect the newest emerging viruses.\n\nCDC uses gene sequence data to update its influenza diagnostic kits and reagents, which are used around the world by public health laboratories as the gold-standard for detecting influenza, in large part because of CDC\u2019s rapid response in updating the kits and reagents each time a novel virus emerges.\n\nFor example, in 2012 the U.S. experienced a rapid up-tick in human infections with swine influenza viruses (called variant virus infections) associated with exposure to infected pigs. CDC quickly confirmed the CDC rRT-PCR test kit\u2019s ability to detect those swine viruses appearing in people, and then issued guidance to laboratories on how to interpret rRT-PCR test results when testing specimens from patients with known pig exposure. Since then, CDC has monitored how the diagnostic kit has performed in detecting variant infections and has updated guidance and virus-specific assay materials (called reagents) to make sure the tests are able to detect these viruses as they have evolved.\n\nIn April 2013, shortly after the first influenza A(H7N9) human infections in China were reported and within days of China CDC sharing gene sequences of the H7N9 virus, U.S. CDC quickly modified and then quality-checked CDC\u2019s existing H7 rRT-PCR test and drafted protocols and guidance for its use. On April 22, 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization and the H7 rRT-PCR test with test components and CDC guidance were made available to public health laboratories so they would be able to test for H7N9 viruses too. International Reagent Resource\nWhile RT-PCR is fast and accurate, it requires a steady stream of laboratory supplies called reagents (primers, probes and enzymes) to perform testing, which can become scarce or costly during outbreaks when testing demands increase.\n\nTo address this potential shortcoming, in 2008 CDC established the Influenza Reagent Resource (IRR) as a warehouse for CDC-developed influenza supplies that laboratories need to carry out basic research; develop diagnostics, vaccines and drugs; and conduct surveillance for emerging influenza threats. During the pandemic, the IRR proved to be a critical resource in terms of providing domestic and international laboratories with the supplies needed to test for the new 2009 H1N1 virus.\n\nTen years later, the IRR is firmly established as a central component of influenza research, surveillance and diagnostic testing in the United States. Further, it also has been expanded to include production and distribution of additional CDC-developed reagents for a wider range of pathogens that are within the scope of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD).Some of the newer additions include reagents for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), meningitis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The program\u2019s broader scope is reflected in a new name, the International Reagent Resource.\n\nWith regard to pandemic preparedness, public health laboratories across the globe continue to use the reagents they receive from the IRR for surveillance of novel influenza viruses (such as H7N9 and H5N1) in tandem with the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS).external icon For influenza and other pathogens, CDC\u2019s subject matter experts provide technical guidance and oversight to ensure that IRR acquires, authenticates, manufactures and distributes quality-controlled reagents that support global surveillance efforts. Advances in Tests Used in Clinical Settings Compared to ten years ago, clinicians now have more tests available for detection of influenza viruses in respiratory specimens, including a wider selection of highly accurate molecular assays (some rapid, some not), and improved rapid influenza antigen detection tests (RIDTs).\n\nRapid and accurate diagnosis of influenza virus infection facilitates timely patient management for seasonal influenza as well as pandemic influenza. Influenza testing has been used to inform decisions on the use of antiviral drugs for treatment, to avoid misuse of antibiotics for treatment, and to reduce the need for other diagnostic tests. Influenza testing also can be helpful in informing recommendations for sick people living with others who are at high risk of developing serious influenza complications. See Guide for considering influenza testing when influenza viruses are circulating in the community for more information.)\n\nThe need for better rapid influenza tests and clear rapid test guidance for clinicians became apparent during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, when false-negative rapid antigen detection test results contributed to delays and missed opportunities in treating pandemic flu virus-infected patients with antiviral drugs; and delays in implementing infection control measures for such patients. [5]\n\nShortly after the pandemic, CDC and partners began working to address issues with rapid antigen detection tests available at the time, reaching an important milestone in 2017 when rapid influenza antigen detection tests (RIDTs) were reclassified by FDA (described in more detail, below) and held to higher standards.\n\nIn June 2014, a new kind of rapid influenza test was approved by FDA (the Alere (TM) i Influenza A&B test by Alere Scarborough, Inc D/B/A Binax, Inc, now owned by Abbott and called the ID NOWTIM Influenza A&B) external iconwhich detects flu A and B viruses by detecting the PB2 flu virus gene in respiratory specimens. This approval marked the beginning of a new category of tests, referred to as rapid influenza molecular assays.\n\nRapid influenza molecular assays are a relatively new type of influenza diagnostic test. These tests are similar to RT-PCR (which is also a molecular process and currently the gold standard for influenza virus detection), in that both tests use nucleic acid amplification, which detects influenza viruses in a respiratory specimen by amplifying (multiplying) certain nucleic acids (building blocks of genes) in the influenza virus genome.\n\nSince 2014, other rapid influenza molecular assays have been approved by FDA and are available for use in clinical settings. Of those, some are approved for point-of-care or bedside use, and do not require a clinical laboratory, including Cobas\u00ae Influenza A/B and Cobas\u00ae Influenza A/B RSV Assay by Roche Molecular Diagnostics; Xpert Xpress Flu and Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV by Cepheid; Accula Flu A/Flu B assay by Mesa Biotech Inc,; and ID Now TM by Abbot.\n\nRapid influenza molecular assays have a strong ability to identify correctly patients with evidence of influenza virus infection (referred to as high sensitivity, greater than 90%) and a strong ability to identify correctly patients without evidence of influenza virus infection, referred to as high specificity (90-100%). These assays produce results in 15 to 30 minutes, making them a convenient option for clinical management of patients. Other rapid influenza molecular assays (such as the Cobas\u00ae Influenza A/B & RSV Assay by Roche Molecular Diagnostics) are approved that detect influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in respiratory specimens. These tests are particularly useful in the clinical management of young children with acute respiratory illness, but can be used for persons of all ages.\n\nAdditionally, a number of other influenza molecular assays are FDA-approved, for use in a moderately complex or complex hospital clinical laboratory. These assays may take more than one hour to produce results. Many of these molecular assays detect influenza A and B viruses as well as other respiratory viruses such as adenovius, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza virus, and RSV. Some also detect some respiratory bacterial infections.\n\nBoth rapid molecular and other molecular assays are more accurate than previously available influenza tests for use in clinical settings. These advances in molecular technology provide more-accurate influenza testing results and are likely to improve clinical management of patients with suspected influenza in ambulatory care clinics and emergency departments, and in hospitalized patients as well.\n\nWith regard to rapid influenza antigen detection tests (RIDTs), to address the issues identified during the pandemic, in 2011 the CDC, the Joint Commission, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) and other public and private partners addressed key RIDT-related issues by:\n\nCreating the first method for systematically evaluating commercially available RIDTs, described in a 2012 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) article\nEnhancing awareness among clinicians of appropriate RIDT protocols with new courses, videos and decision-making tools, and;\nWorking with FDA to reclassify RIDTs from Class I to Class II with Special Controls, thereby holding current and new RIDTs to higher performance standards.\nReclassification means that RIDTs are now subject to the following requirements [6]:\n\nManufacturers must test their RIDTs annually to ensure they can detect currently circulating seasonal flu viruses. RIDTs with lower sensitivity to those flu viruses will need to indicate so on their labeling.\nRIDTs must meet minimum performance criteria, such as high sensitivity and high specificity to detect flu viruses in respiratory specimens compared to RT-PCR or viral culture. This means that currently FDA-approved RIDTs will now be more accurate in detecting flu viruses in respiratory specimens than previous RIDTs.\nIn the event of a pandemic, manufacturers must test the reactivity of their RIDTs with the newly emergent flu virus as soon as virus samples become available.\nSince 2017 when reclassification of RIDTs occurred, manufacturers have made positive, steady changes to rapid influenza antigen detection tests, but more work still needs to be done. Surveillance\nRight-sizing initiative The massive amount of laboratory testing that occurred during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic provided an opportunity for researchers to identify the optimal levels of influenza surveillance and laboratory testing needed in the United States, including ways to improve efficiency.\n\nTo answer those questions, in 2010, CDC and the Association of Public Health laboratories (APHL) began developing a \u201cright-size\u201d approach to influenza virologic surveillance which was based on extensive input from public health laboratories and stakeholders. Since then, this right-size approach has helped public health laboratories to:\n\nstandardize virologic surveillance practices, determine the optimal number of specimens to test to produce statistical confidence in resulting data, and define public health surveillance priorities;\nadopt requirements, resources and statistical calculators that aid in planning and justifying budget and resource requests;\nincrease the understanding and support from political leaders and the public;\nspeak a common language between laboratories and epidemiologists; and\nassist decision makers in analyzing the impacts of budget decisions on national surveillance objectives, especially with regard to pandemic preparedness capacity. Automated transmission of laboratory reports\nIn addition to identifying the optimum \u201csampling\u201d strategy, major improvements in sharing this data have taken place. In March 2010, five laboratories were routinely sharing data electronically with CDC. Today, all public health laboratories at the state level and some local public health and clinical laboratories send data electronically to CDC\u2019s Influenza Division This increase has improved the timeliness and completeness of reporting, for both seasonal influenza surveillance activities and the identification of novel influenza A viruses.\n\nIncorporation of NCHS mortality data\nIn collaboration with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), since the 2015-2016 flu season CDC\u2019s Influenza Division has used mortality data collected from death certificates and reported to NCHS as the principal tool to track influenza-associated mortality in the United States.\n\nThe shift to NCHS data marked a significant advance in the capacity to track flu mortality, owing in part to efforts made by NCHS to improve the timeliness of jurisdiction reporting and modernize the infrastructure of national vital statistics, all of which resulted in a system capable of supporting near real-time surveillance of most deaths in the United States.\n\nThe new system presents deaths by the date of occurrence rather than by the date on which deaths were registered. It also provides a consistent case definition and covers nearly all deaths occurring in the United States, which is an improvement over the previous (now retired) system which accounted for only 25 percent of all US deaths. Inclusion of electronic data in ILINet CDC\u2019s U.S. Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) collects data each week from up to 3,500 outpatient health care providers across all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Each week, these health care providers report the total number of patients seen, and the number of patients seen with influenza-like illness (ILI), by five age groups. The process of reporting numbers of total patients and ILI patients was labor-intensive, sometimes leading to reporting delays and dips in participation. Since the pandemic, more ILINet providers have used electronic health records in determining ILI and patient visits, thereby reducing the reporting burden and providing more-comprehensive, efficient and timely surveillance. ILINet now captures more patient visits: during the 2018-19 season, more than one million patient visits were reported weekly, almost double the number of patient visits reported weekly during the 2009 pandemic.\n\nAntiviral resistance testing\nAnother step forward in surveillance is the number of public health laboratories in the U.S. that test for resistance to influenza antiviral medications, which increased from four laboratories before the 2009 H1N1 pandemic to 20 laboratories in 2019. This improvement was accomplished through training courses, site visits, technical and other support from CDC. In addition, four laboratories are now able to conduct advanced testing for antiviral drug resistance, using a more sensitive and complex procedure. Since 2018, CDC\u2019s influenza laboratories have been testing seasonal and animal viruses for susceptibility to the newest anti-influenza drug \u2013 baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) and a CDC-developed assay is now being implemented at the public health laboratory designated for antiviral testing (NIRC, Albany NY). Lastly, in collaboration with a World Health Organization (WHO) expert group, reference laboratory materials for detection and reporting of influenza drug resistance have been developed and shared with laboratories around the world. The Burden of Influenza\nDuring the pandemic, influenza hospitalization rates increased, particularly among groups of people at high risk of developing serious flu complications.\n\nThe Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in children and adults. It has provided critical data for:\n\ninforming policy and decision making, especially with regard to vaccine and antiviral prioritization;\nevaluating the effectiveness and safety of pandemic vaccine; and,\nidentifying groups at high risk for severe flu complications.\nOver the course of the pandemic, CDC refined and revised its hospitalization surveillance methods, eventually developing a way to use FluSurv-NET data to estimate the range of 2009 pandemic flu illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths (also referred to as \u2018estimates of flu burden\u2019) in the United States.\n\nSince the 2009 pandemic, this method of estimation has been applied at the end of each flu season as a means of illustrating the national impact of seasonal flu. In 2019, CDC also began providing on a weekly basis preliminary estimates of the burden of influenza during flu season.\n\nBurden of influenza averted through vaccination CDC also developed estimates of the number of flu illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths prevented by flu vaccination each flu season. These estimates are made with mathematical models that combine illness rates, vaccine coverage, and vaccine effectiveness, to estimate the amount of flu that would have occurred without flu vaccination. The amount of flu that was prevented by vaccination was the difference between what would have occurred and what was estimated to have actually occurred. CDC has continued to estimate the benefits of influenza vaccination each season. Now, CDC and its partners are better able to communicate the benefits of flu vaccination and provide clear evidence on the public health impact that vaccination can have in reducing flu illness. Vaccine effectiveness monitoring\nWhile FluSurv-NET provided vaccine effectiveness (VE) data during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the US Flu VE Network has yielded in-depth data about how well flu vaccines are working each flu season since its inception in 2005.\n\nSeasonal VE data are instrumental in making vaccine policy decisions and improving virus selection to update the composition of seasonal vaccines. VE data are also pivotal to understanding the epidemiology and severity of pandemic and seasonal influenza and to mounting an appropriate responses.\n\nFollowing the pandemic, multiple improvements were made to the US Flu VE Network including expanding the number of sites, increasing enrollment, improving the timeliness of data collection and reporting, and building an infrastructure for conducting special studies to improve the benefits of vaccines. In addition, in 2016-17 CDC established the Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN), which focuses on VE among severely ill adults, as opposed to VE among persons seen as outpatients. With regard to available data, at the time of the pandemic, VE studies had shown that influenza vaccination reduced the risk of mild or moderately severe influenza by approximately half among children and adults, but there were gaps in knowledge about how well the vaccine worked in preventing lab-confirmed influenza among pregnant women and in preventing life-threatening influenza among children and adults.\n\nVE data directly influence policymakers\u2019 decisions regarding influenza vaccination policy both in the United States and in other countries, so over the last 10 years CDC has created partnerships and funded research to address major VE knowledge gaps, all with an eye toward advancing vaccination efforts in the U.S. and internationally.\n\nPregnant Women The first CDC-funded study to address these gaps, which was also the first to use laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes to assess VE among pregnant women, was published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases in January 2014. This study, which looked at Kaiser Permanente health plan members in two regions, showed that influenza vaccination reduced their risk of flu illness by half during 2010 to 2012, indicating that flu vaccine works about as well in pregnant women as in other young, healthy adults. The study showed influenza vaccine effectiveness estimates among pregnant women were similar to those found in other studies among young adults, which ranged from 44% to 51% from 2010 to 2012.\n\nSee Study Finds Flu Vaccine Reduces Risk of Flu Illness in Pregnant Women by Half for more information.\n\nThe second CDC-funded study was published in Clinical Infectious Diseases in October 2018: it was the first study to show that vaccination protects pregnant women against flu-associated hospitalization.\n\nTo conduct this study, CDC partnered with a number of other public health agencies and health care systems in Australia, Canada, Israel, and the United States through the Pregnancy Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (PREVENT), which consists of health care systems with integrated laboratory, medical, and vaccination records. Sites retrospectively examined medical records of more than two million women who were pregnant from 2010 through 2016 to identify those who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed flu.\n\nKey findings of this study include the following:\n\nOver the course of six flu seasons, getting a flu shot reduced a pregnant woman\u2019s risk of being hospitalized from flu by an average of 40 percent.\nMore than 80 percent of pregnancies overlapped with flu season, underscoring the likelihood that pregnant women will be exposed to flu at some point during their pregnancy.\nFlu vaccine was equally protective for pregnant women with underlying medical problems such as asthma and diabetes, which also increase the risk of serious medical complications including a worsening of those chronic conditions.\nFlu vaccine was equally protective for women during all three trimesters.\nSee Flu Vaccine Reduces Risk of Flu Hospitalization Among Pregnant Women for more information.\n\nChildren and Adults:\nIn March 2014 another critical gap was filled, when the first study to estimate VE in children against flu admissions to pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) was published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. CDC researchers found that getting a flu vaccine reduces a child\u2019s risk of flu-related intensive care hospitalization by 74%, illustrating the important protection flu vaccine can provide to children against more-serious flu outcomes.\n\nResearchers analyzed the medical records of 216 children age 6 months through 17 years admitted to 21 PICUs in the United States during the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 flu seasons.\n\nThough flu vaccination was associated with a significant reduction in risk of PICU admission, flu vaccine coverage was relatively low among the children in this study: only 18 percent of flu cases admitted to the ICU had been fully vaccinated.\n\nMore than half (55 percent) of PICU cases had at least one underlying chronic medical condition that placed them at higher risk of serious flu-related complications.\n\nSee New Study Shows Flu Vaccine Reduced Children\u2019s Risk of Intensive Care Unit Flu Admission by Three-Fourths for more information.\n\nIn August 2018, a CDC-supported study published in Vaccine was the first to provide statistically significant VE estimates for adults against hospitalization and admission to ICU.\n\nThe study was conducted over four flu seasons from 2012 to 2015 and found that flu vaccination prevented severe disease:\n\nFlu vaccination among adults reduced the risk of being admitted to the hospital with flu and placed in a general ward bed by 37 percent.\nFlu vaccination was even more effective in preventing the most severe forms of flu and reduced the risk of being admitted to an ICU with flu by 82 percent.\nBecause flu vaccine varies in how well it works and people who are vaccinated may still get sick, the study also looked at whether flu vaccination reduced the severity of illness among hospitalized people who were vaccinated compared to those who were unvaccinated and found that:\n\nAmong adults who were admitted to the hospital with flu, vaccinated adults were 59 percent less likely to have very severe illness resulting in ICU admission than those who had not been vaccinated.\nAmong adults in the ICU with flu, vaccinated patients on average spent 4 fewer days in the hospital than those who were not vaccinated previously.\nThe study was a collaborative project with CDC, conducted through the Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness Research and Surveillance project, which prospectively enrolled hospitalized adults 18 years and older from 2012 to 2015 in Auckland, New Zealand. Eligible hospitalized patients were those who had an overnight admission with acute respiratory illness. Once enrolled in the study, patients self-reported their flu vaccination status and were tested for flu infection by RT-PCR. Prevention\nInfluenza Vaccines\nCDC and its partners have made significant progress in influenza surveillance; diagnostics; characterizing viruses for vaccine strain selection; and developing systems to evaluate the effectiveness of influenza vaccines over the last ten years.\n\nFor example, with regard to vaccine development, by using newer production technologies CDC can now identify and provide candidate vaccine viruses for novel influenza threats to manufacturers within a matter of weeks.\n\nThis and other improvements have helped to better protect the public from seasonal and pandemic influenza threats through vaccination. However, to more fully protect Americans from seasonal and pandemic flu, more effective vaccines are needed and more people still need to receive annual flu vaccines.\n\nIn line with that public health mission, more doses of seasonal vaccines and different vaccine products are available than ever before. In addition to trivalent inactivated vaccine and live attenuated influenza vaccine, the following vaccines have been approved by the FDA and are now available:\n\na high dose vaccine that is designed specifically for people 65 and older to help create a stronger antibody response;\na trivalent flu vaccine made with adjuvant (an ingredient added to vaccine that helps create a stronger immune response), which was approved for people 65 years of age and older;\nthe first U.S.-approved cell-based flu vaccine, which can potentially be made more quickly than traditional egg-based vaccines and does not require a large supply of eggs to produce;\nquadrivalent (four component) flu vaccines that protect against both lineages of influenza B viruses thus offering expanded protection against circulating influenza viruses; and,\nrecombinant influenza vaccines, which do not require an egg-grown vaccine virus or eggs to produce, and which may be manufactured more quickly than egg-based vaccines.\nCDC is currently exploring new ways to further improve influenza vaccine through the influenza vaccine improvement initiative (iVii). The initiative includes two primary goals.\n\nGoal 1: Build the evidence base for developing more-effective influenza vaccines, and increase the impact of vaccines that are currently available.\n\nThis goal points to the need for deeper data, so during the 2018-19 season, CDC increased the number and scope of VE Network participants by over 1,500 children and adults, bringing the total number of participants enrolled to more than 10,500.\n\nCDC also is increasing the diversity of people who can be enrolled in studies and has expanded VE monitoring through innovative use of health care and other data sources outside of the US Flu VE Network. The laboratory process of evaluating vaccine response through the use of enhanced serologic and cellular testing has also been improved.\n\nGoal 2: Increase the capacity of CDC laboratories to select, develop, evaluate and perform virus characterization to provide candidate vaccine viruses.\n\nTo accomplish this, CDC is employing state-of-the-art technologies to increase the volume of laboratory testing being done. CDC also is working on developing new assays for manufacturers and regulatory laboratories, and planning evaluation projects that support vaccine improvement.\n\nCDC also is focusing on expanding and improving global virus detection, and improving vaccine effectiveness monitoring. This is being done through the expansion of Next Generation Sequencing and fully transitioning to the Sequence-First initiative described earlier. In the process, CDC has also worked with partners to automate the pipeline used to produce, store and share the enormous volume of NGS data.\n\nCDC also is piloting an advanced laboratory strategy to identify viruses, using antigenic data that are likely to predominate in the human population in future influenza seasons.\n\nCDC meets regularly with vaccine manufacturers and other WHO Collaborating Centers and Essential Regulatory Laboratories including FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research to share information on a number of vaccine-related topics.\n\nTopics include the availability of candidate vaccine viruses for use in the development and production of seasonal influenza vaccines, the availability of protocols and reagents needed for the development, standardization, and regulation of influenza vaccines, and to discuss potential issues related to the timely production of seasonal influenza vaccines. The group meets from the time the vaccine composition is announced until vaccines are released for distribution to health care providers, for both the northern and southern hemisphere influenza seasons.\n\nSeparately, frequent Flu Risk Management Meetings serve as a venue to discuss issues relating to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) response to seasonal and pandemic influenza. Subjects for discussion include but are not limited to seasonal surveillance updates, effectiveness of influenza vaccines, vaccine and antiviral stockpiles, emerging influenza virus surveillance, clinical trial response to influenza outbreaks of novel influenza viruses, and pandemic preparedness. Community Mitigation Measures\nCommunity Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza \u2013 United States, 2017\n\nBased on lessons learned from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response and an expanded contemporary NPI evidence base, CDC published updated pre-pandemic planning guidelines \u2013 Community Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza \u2013 United States, 2017 \u2013 in MMWR Recommendations and Reports on April 21, 2017. The guidelines offer free CE credits for healthcare and public health practitioners, and are available at https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/rr/pdfs/rr6601.pdfpdf icon.\n\nThe 2017 guidelines summarize key lessons learned from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response; encourage state and local public health officials to plan and prepare for implementing NPIs early in an influenza pandemic in community settings; describe new or updated pandemic planning and assessment tools; and provide the latest scientific findings to support updated recommendations on the use of NPIs to help slow the spread and decrease the impact of an influenza pandemic. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic response highlighted that pre-pandemic planning and preparedness \u2013 from local to federal levels \u2013 must be broad, flexible, and multi-sectoral, and emphasized the critical value of public engagement and community preparedness \u2013 including families, schools, and businesses \u2013 for successful NPI implementation during a pandemic. Research conducted during and in the wake of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic documented that public acceptance of NPIs in the United States is generally high, even for disruptive measures like school closures. These findings underscore the importance of pandemic preparedness at all levels of society to ensure timely implementation of community mitigation measures from the onset of a future pandemic, when these measures may be the only tool available in many jurisdictions.\n\nTo help implement the 2017 guidelines and to assist states and localities with pre-pandemic planning and decision-making in their communities, CDC also published online six plain-language, pre-pandemic NPI planning guides for various audiences and community settings: households, educational settings, workplace settings, community- and faith-based organizations serving vulnerable populations, event planners of large/mass gatherings, and health communicators in community preparedness. The six guides are available.\n\nCDC continues to conduct and support research to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of NPI implementation in various community settings. Select NPI research references, as well as additional NPI communication, education, and training materials, are available at CDC\u2019s dedicated NPI website. Treatment The number of available, approved and recommended treatment options has increased in the last ten years.\n\nDuring the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the influenza antiviral medication oseltamivir (oral oseltamivir, available under the trade name Tamiflu\u00ae) was used extensively for treatment, while zanamivir (inhaled, trade name Relenza\u00ae) was used less.\n\nOral oseltamivir\u2019s widespread use was due to it being approved, recommended and utilized for treatment of patients hospitalized with severe influenza. It also was recommended for use in hospitalized patients with non-severe influenza, although no antiviral medications were approved by FDA for use in that group.\n\nOutpatients could be prescribed either oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir, which were both approved for early treatment of uncomplicated influenza by FDA.\n\nOf the two medications, CDC was more concerned with the possibility of resistance emerging against oseltamivir, which did happen, but not often. The oseltamivir-resistant viruses that did emerge were not transmitted easily from person to person, and zanamivir was used effectively to treat them.\n\nBeginning in April 2009 and continuing for a few years after the pandemic, the FDA\u2019s Emergency Investigational New Drug (EIND) program provided an application process which authorized investigational use of IV zanamivir for patients with severe and life-threatening influenza.\n\nLater, on October 23rd, 2009, FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for IV Peramivir. At the time, IV Peramivir was an investigational intravenous antiviral drug used rarely to treat people who had been hospitalized with severe influenza. The drug was held in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) and distributed by CDC under the EUA. Licensed clinicians were able to request this product through the CDC website electronic request system, and product was delivered directly to hospital facilities until June 2010 when the EUA was terminated. Following the pandemic, in December 2014, IV Peramivir was approved by FDA for early treatment of uncomplicated influenza in outpatients, which also opened up some off-label use in treating influenza in hospitalized patients. Previously, with the exception of the IV Peramivir EUA during the pandemic, oseltamivir and zanamivir were the only recommended antiviral medications for treatment of influenza. (The other approved antiviral drugs \u2013 amantadine and rimantadine \u2013 were not and are still not recommended due to high levels of resistance detected in circulating influenza viruses).\n\nRoughly three years later, in September 2017, FDA approved the first generic version of oseltamivir.\n\nOseltamivir, zanamivir and IV peramivir are all neuraminidase-inhibitor influenza antiviral medications, so named because each works by targeting the neuraminidase surface protein of the influenza virus to stop the virus from being released from infected cells and spreading to healthy cells.\n\nIn December 2018, a new influenza antiviral medication called oral baloxavir marboxil (trade name Xofluza\u00ae) was approved by FDA and is recommended for treatment of influenza. Baloxavir works differently, primarily by preventing an influenza virus from multiplying when it is inside a cell. Because baloxavir works differently, it is in a new class of antiviral medications called cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitors. Like the neuraminidase-inhibitor medications, baloxavir has activity against both influenza A and B viruses. Baloxavir is approved for early treatment of uncomplicated influenza in outpatients aged 12 years and older.\n\nWith more antiviral medications approved, recommended and available, treatment options have improved for both hospitalized patients with severe influenza and outpatients seeking treatment early for uncomplicated influenza. There remains a gap, however, in approved antiviral treatment options for hospitalized patients with non-severe influenza, although CDC and IDSA (Infectious Diseases Society of America) continue to recommend that those patients be treated with neuraminidase-inhibitor antiviral medications. Decision-making tools\nRisk assessment (IRAT)\nThe 2009 H1N1 pandemic highlighted the public health value of developing an objective, scientifically based tool for assessing the potential pandemic risk posed to humans by influenza A viruses circulating in animals. To fill that need, CDC developed an evaluation tool now called the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) with help from global animal and human health influenza experts. IRAT launched in 2011 and since then CDC has used it to evaluate the potential risk posed by viruses that are not currently circulating in people. The IRAT relies on input from subject matter experts representing a variety of expertise in the study of influenza viruses. It uses 10 evaluation criteria grouped into major categories including properties of the virus, attributes of the human population, and epidemiology and ecology of the virus, to generate scores that indicate the potential risk of the virus to emerge as a pandemic virus, and the potential impact if it does.\n\nThe IRAT is not a prediction tool. Rather, the IRAT provides structure to prioritize and maximize investments in pandemic preparedness; identify key gaps in information; document transparently the data and scientific process used to inform management decisions associated with pandemic preparedness; provide a flexible means to easily and regularly update the risk assessment of novel flu viruses as new information becomes available; communicate effectively to the general public, policymakers, public health laboratories and other stakeholders; and provide a means to weigh the 10 evaluation criteria differently depending on whether the intent is to measure the ability of a virus to \u201cemerge\u201d as a pandemic-capable virus, or \u201cimpact\u201d the human population after emerging.\n\nSince its inception eight years ago, the IRAT has been used by CDC to evaluate and inform pandemic preparedness decisions for 16 viruses, the results of which are listed at Summary of Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) Results. Forecasting\nUnlike traditional surveillance systems that lag behind the real-time situation, flu forecasting offers the possibility to look into the future and forecast when and where flu increases will occur, how large the impact of flu will be, and when flu will peak. Forecasts can inform messaging to health care providers regarding influenza vaccination and antiviral treatment for patients, help to prepare for an influx of illnesses and hospitalizations, and be used to guide community mitigation strategies, such as school closures.\n\nTo support the development of the science of flu forecasting and its application for public health, CDC, through the Epidemic Prediction Initiative (EPI), organized the first FluSight challenge to forecast the timing, intensity, and short-term activity of the influenza season during the 2013-14 season. Each influenza season since then, Influenza Division researchers have worked with CDC\u2019s EPI and other external researchers to improve flu forecasting. CDC provides forecasting teams data, relevant public health forecasting targets, and forecast accuracy metrics evaluated against actual flu activity while each team submits their forecasts based on a variety of methods and data sources each week. During the 2018\u201319 season, forecasting teams provided over 30 national-level forecasts each week.\n\nThese challenges have provided the scientific and public health community with experience in real-time forecasting, the ability to evaluate forecast accuracy, and familiarity in communicating and applying these forecasts in real-world settings. These experiences are critical to developing a network of forecasters capable of providing results that public health officials can use, both in seasons and during an influenza pandemic.\n\nForecasts are currently used to inform CDC\u2019s activity summaries provided to public health officials and CDC leadership, and to inform messages to the general public regarding the timing of the influenza season and steps the public can take to protect their health. International work CDC has strong global ties with other WHO Collaborating Centers for Influenza, National Influenza Centers and ministries of health around the world. These collaborators provided critical data throughout the influenza pandemic on how, when and where the pandemic virus might be changing and if the monovalent pandemic vaccine would continue to be effective in preventing infection.\n\nCDC\u2019s Influenza Division formed an influenza international capacity-building initiative in 2004, which provided a five-year period of financial support for nine countries to improve laboratory diagnostics and sentinel surveillance for influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infection. In 2009, this number increased to 37 countries receiving support under 39 cooperative agreements.\n\nThus, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic occurred at a time when many of the 37 countries benefited from the newly established influenza surveillance and laboratory capacities. The pandemic provided the ultimate test to determine whether their laboratory diagnostics and surveillance systems were indeed strong enough to manage the massive surges in flu activity that would come their way.\n\nShortly after the pandemic, eight of the 37 countries transitioned to the program\u2019s second five-year period, called the sustainability period. During this period, financial support was reduced as the programs focused on sustaining the gains made in laboratory diagnostics and surveillance. The countries focused on standardizing foundational aspects of influenza surveillance including regular influenza activity reporting and sending viruses to CDC and other WHO Collaborating Centers, all with an eye toward ensuring preparedness for the next pandemic.\n\nNow, following 10 years of the pandemic\u2019s race around the globe, which caused hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide, many countries have graduated from the sustainability period to maintenance and some are now developing in-country seasonal influenza vaccination programs based on their influenza surveillance data.\n\nThe 2009 H1N1 pandemic tested U.S. laboratory and surveillance systems and highlighted many successes along the way, shining a light on one of the biggest takeaways of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic: develop seasonal influenza epidemiology and laboratory capacity that\u2019s flexible enough to handle the next pandemic.",

            "Text": "Where did the 2009 H1N1 flu virus come from?\nThe 2009 H1N1 influenza virus (referred to as \u201cswine flu\u201d early on) was first detected in people in the United States in April 2009. This virus was originally referred to as \u201cswine flu\u201d because laboratory testing showed that its gene segments were similar to influenza viruses that were most recently identified in and known to circulate among pigs. CDC believes that this virus resulted from reassortment, a process through which two or more influenza viruses can swap genetic information by infecting a single human or animal host. When reassortment does occur, the virus that emerges will have some gene segments from each of the infecting parent viruses and may have different characteristics than either of the parental viruses, just as children may exhibit unique characteristics that are like both of their parents. In this case, the reassortment appears most likely to have occurred between influenza viruses circulating in North American pig herds and among Eurasian pig herds.  Reassortment of influenza viruses can result in abrupt, major changes in influenza viruses, also known as \u201cantigenic shift.\u201d When shift happens, most people have little or no protection against the new influenza virus that results. For more information, see \u201cHow the Flu Virus can Shift: Drift for Shift.\u201d\n\nWhy does CDC think this?\nThere are three primary reasons why experts from CDC and other public health research institutions around the world think 2009 H1N1 influenza resulted from reassortment of influenza viruses that occur naturally among pigs.\n\nReason One\nThe different gene segments of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus are traceable to influenza viruses found in pigs. All influenza viruses have eight genes. Six of the eight genes found within the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus are associated with influenza viruses that regularly cause illness in pigs in North America. The remaining two genes of the 2009 H1N1 flu virus are associated with influenza viruses that previously were only known to be circulating among pigs from Eurasia.1, 2 The mixing of live pigs from Eurasia and North America through international trade or other means could have created the circumstances necessary for influenza viruses from North American and Eurasian pigs to mix. In fact, a 2009 study in Nature demonstrated that reassortant influenza viruses with genes from North American and Eurasian pigs were found in samples collected from pigs in Hong Kong as early as 2004.2*\n\n*The reassortant influenza viruses found in Hong Kong from 2004 are different from the 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses that have caused human illness around the world today, but these viruses serve as an example of how reassortment can occur naturally among influenza viruses found in Eurasian and North American pigs.\n\nReason Two\nEvidence suggests that the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus has existed and evolved in nature for some time prior to being detected in humans. There are laboratory techniques available for looking at how and at what speed influenza viruses evolve and change. This is related to a concept known as \u201cmolecular evolution.\u201d  Evolution refers to small changes in influenza viruses that happen continually over time. Generally speaking, influenza viruses generate mutations by passing from one animal to another animal for several years and through virus replication in the animal host. These mutations are represented by changes in the nucleotides and amino acids found within influenza viruses. These small changes occur at a relatively stable rate in all influenza viruses. As a result, scientists can compare the number of mutations found within a new influenza virus with older, related influenza viruses to estimate the amount of time that it may have taken for one strain to evolve into a new strain of influenza virus.  Researchers at CDC used this molecular evolution method to determine that the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus likely evolved in nature \u2013 perhaps through circulation in an unknown animal host \u2013 for a number of years before being detected. At this time, CDC continues to monitor the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus for changes. Research so far suggests that the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus is changing at a normal rate as compared to other influenza viruses.\n\nReason Three\nThe 2009 H1N1 influenza virus does not have the adaptations that are typical of influenza viruses grown or created in laboratories. For example, the standard method of growing influenza virus in laboratories involves injecting the virus into fertilized chicken eggs. The 2009 H1N1 influenza virus lacks the properties associated with growth in eggs.  \n\nHave viruses similar to the 2009 H1N1 virus been seen before?\nPrior to the discovery of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, this particular combination of gene segments from North American and Eurasian swine had never been detected before in a single influenza virus and this new virus is different from the influenza viruses that normally circulate in North American and Eurasian pigs. It is not known when reassortment occurred to create the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus.  Testing of the virus suggests that this reassortment event may have occurred years prior to the first reports of 2009 H1N1 influenza infection in people.1, 2 Scientists call 2009 H1N1 influenza a \"quadruple reassortant\" virus, because although each separate gene segment of the virus has been found in pigs previously, the individual gene segments of the virus originated from humans, birds, North American pigs and Eurasian pigs.\n\nWhy does the 2009 H1N1 flu virus have genes from humans, birds, and from pigs on different continents?\nPigs can be infected by influenza viruses found in birds and other animals as well as people.  Therefore, pigs represent a mixing vessel in which influenza viruses from different species can swap genes. For example, in a setting where people and animals are in close contact, pigs can be infected by influenza viruses found in pigs, poultry or humans \u2013 sometimes at the same time. For at least 80 years, influenza viruses known as \u201cclassical swine H1N1\u201d viruses have circulated in North American pigs. However, in the late 1990s, a series of reassortment events occurred between influenza viruses found in pigs, humans and birds. As a result, swine influenza viruses with genes from humans, North American pigs and birds have existed in many parts of the world for around 10 years prior to 2009 H1N1 flu. Mixing of these \u201ctriple reassortant North American swine influenza viruses\u201d with Eurasian swine viruses likely resulted in the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus.\n\nWas the 2009 H1N1 flu virus created in a laboratory?\nThis is very unlikely. Each of the gene segments within the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus have been found in pigs for more than 10 years prior to the beginning of the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak.2  Pigs have long been considered a possible mixing vessel for influenza viruses that originate within pigs, birds and humans. In addition, a 2009 Nature study showed that reassortment between influenza viruses found in North American and Eurasia pigs had already occurred at least once naturally in the 5 years prior to the identification of 2009 H1N1 flu. Also, the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus does not have adaptations consistent with viruses grown in laboratories. For more information, see reasons 1, 2 and 3 above.\n\nHow often does reassortment of influenza viruses occur?\nWe know that reassortment occurs frequently in nature. Fortunately, reassortment rarely results in a virus with pandemic potential, though it has done so at least twice in the 20th century. The influenza viruses that caused the 1957 and 1968 pandemics contained a mixture of gene segments from human and avian influenza viruses.  What is clear from genetic analysis of the viruses that caused these past pandemics is that reassortment (gene swapping) occurred to produce novel influenza viruses that caused the pandemics.  In both of these cases, the new viruses that emerged showed major differences from the parent viruses.  However, not all viruses emerge directly from reassortment events. For example, the origins of the 1918 virus are not precisely known, but experts think it is likely that the 1918 virus may have resulted from a bird influenza virus directly infecting humans and pigs at about the same time without reassortment.\n\nWhat can be done to identify influenza viruses circulating in animals that have pandemic potential?\nThe emergence of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus in humans highlights the need for better surveillance of influenza viruses in pigs and other animals.  The mixing of influenza genes in pigs can result in the emergence of viruses with pandemic potential in humans. Improved surveillance of influenza in pigs and other animals may help to detect the emergence of influenza viruses with the potential to cause illness and spread among people, possibly resulting in a pandemic.  Early detection of such viruses can alert public health officials and aid in pandemic preparedness through the development of appropriate diagnostic tests and influenza vaccine candidate viruses, if necessary.",

This document provides interim guidance and will be updated as needed\n\nThis document provides updated interim guidance on the use of facemasks and respirators for decreasing the exposure to 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus. This guidance replaces other CDC guidance on mask and/or respirator use that may be included in other CDC documents in regards to the outbreak of 2009 H1N1 virus. No change has been made to guidance on the use of facemasks and respirators for health care settings. This document includes guidance on facemask and respirator use for a wider range of settings than was included in previous documents and includes recommendations for those who are at increased risk of severe illness from infection with the 2009 H1N1 virus compared with those who are at lower risk of severe illness from influenza infection. For more information about human infection with 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus, visit the CDC H1N1 Flu website. Other CDC 2009 H1N1 guidance will be updated with the information contained in this document as soon as possible.\n\nDetailed background information and recommendations regarding the use of facemasks and respirators in non-occupational community settings can be found on PandemicFlu.gov in the document Interim Public Health Guidance for the Use of Facemasks and Respirators in Non-Occupational Community Settings during an Influenza PandemicExternal Web Site Icon. Information on the use of facemasks and respirators in health care settings is available. Information on the effectiveness of facemasks and respirators for decreasing the risk of influenza infection in community settings is extremely limited. Thus, it is difficult to assess their potential effectiveness in decreasing the risk of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus transmission in these settings. In the absence of clear scientific data, the interim recommendations below have been developed on the basis of public health judgment, the historical use of facemasks and respirators in other settings for preventing transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses, and on current information on the spread and severity of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus.\n\nIn areas with confirmed human cases of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus infection, the risk for infection can be reduced through a combination of actions. No single action will provide complete protection, but an approach combining the following steps can help decrease the likelihood of transmission. These recommended actions are:\n\nWash hands frequently with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub*\nCover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth\nPeople who are sick with an influenza-like illness (ILI) (fever plus at least cough or sore throat and possibly other symptoms like runny nose, body aches, headaches, chills, fatigue, vomiting and diarrhea) should stay home and keep away from others as much as possible, including avoiding travel, for at least 24 hours after fever is gone except to get medical care or for other necessities. (Fever should be gone without the use of fever-reducing medicine). \nAvoid close contact (i.e. being within about 6 feet) with persons with ILI.\nIn addition, influenza antiviral medications are an important tool for the treatment and prevention of influenza, including 2009 H1N1. Also see Guidance on the use of antiviral medications.\n\nFacemasks and Respirators\nRecommendations for the uses of facemasks and/or respirators are listed in Table 1 below for different settings where a person may be exposed to 2009 H1N1 virus. These recommendations also differ based on whether the person exposed to 2009 H1N1 is in a group at increased risk for severe illness from influenza infection. More information on preventing influenza transmission in health care settings can be found in the Interim Guidance for Infection Control for Care of Patients with Confirmed or Suspected 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Infection in a Healthcare Setting.\n\nIn community and home settings, the use of facemasks and respirators generally are not recommended.  However, for certain circumstances as described in Table 1, a facemask or respirator may be considered, specifically for persons at increased risk of severe illness from influenza.\n\nUse of N95 respirators or facemasks generally is not recommended for workers in non-healthcare occupational settings for general work activities.  For specific work activities that involve contact with people who have ILI, such as escorting a person with ILI, interviewing a person with ILI, providing assistance to an individual with ILI, the following are recommended:\n\nworkers should try to maintain a distance of 6 feet or more from the person with ILI;\nworkers should keep their interactions with ill persons as brief as possible;\nthe ill person should be asked to follow good cough etiquette and hand hygiene and to wear a facemask, if able, and one is available;\nworkers at increased risk of severe illness from influenza infection (see footnote 3 of table 1) should avoid people with ILI (possibly by temporary reassignment); and,\nwhere workers cannot avoid close contact with persons with ILI, some workers may choose to wear a facemask or N95 respirator on a voluntary basis.\nIn the occupational healthcare setting, respiratory protection is recommended.  Because infection control precautions, including respiratory protection, are imperfect, workers who are at increased risk of severe illness from influenza, and who are caring for a patient with known, probable, or suspected 2009 H1N1 or ILI, may consider temporary reassignment to avoid exposure.\n\nAdditional recommendations for use of facemasks by people who have ILI that may be due to 2009 H1N1 infection are included in Table 2.\n\nThere are important differences between facemasks and respirators. Facemasks do not seal tightly to the face and are used to block large droplets from coming into contact with the wearer\u2019s mouth or nose. Most respirators (e.g. N95) are designed to seal tightly to the wearer\u2019s face and filter out very small particles that can be breathed in by the user. For both facemasks and respirators, however, limited data is available on their effectiveness in preventing transmission of H1N1 (or seasonal influenza) in various settings. However, the use of a facemask or respirator is likely to be of most benefit if used as early as possible when exposed to an ill person and when the facemask or respirator is used consistently. (Ref. 1. MacIntyre CR, et al. EID 2009;15:233-41. 2. Cowling BJ, et al. Non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent household transmission of influenza. The 8th Asia Pacific Congress of Medical Virology, Hong Kong, 26-28 February 2009.)\n\nFacemasks:  Unless otherwise specified, the term \u201dfacemasks\u201d refers to disposable facemasks cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as medical devices. This includes facemasks labeled as surgical, dental, medical procedure, isolation, or laser masks. Such facemasks have several designs. One type is affixed to the head with two ties, conforms to the face with the aid of a flexible adjustment for the nose bridge, and may be flat/pleated or duck-billed in shape. Another type of facemask is pre-molded, adheres to the head with a single elastic band, and has a flexible adjustment for the nose bridge. A third type is flat/pleated and affixes to the head with ear loops. Facemasks cleared by the FDA for use as medical devices have been determined to have specific levels of protection from penetration of blood and body fluids. Facemasks help stop droplets from being spread by the person wearing them. They also keep splashes or sprays from reaching the mouth and nose of the person wearing the facemask. They are not designed to protect against breathing in very small particle aerosols that may contain viruses. Facemasks should be used once and then thrown away in the trash.\n\nRespirators: Unless otherwise specified, \"respirator\" refers to an N95 or higher filtering face piece respirator certified by the CDC/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). A respirator is designed to protect the person wearing the respirator against breathing in very small particle aerosols that may contain viruses. A respirator that fits snugly on the face can filter out virus-containing small particle aerosols that can be generated by an infected person, but compared with a facemask it is harder to breathe through a respirator for long periods of time. Respirators are not recommended for children or people who have facial hair.\n\nWhere respirators are used in a non-occupational setting, fit testing, medical evaluation and training are recommended for optimal effectiveness.\n\nWhen respiratory protection is required in an occupational setting, respirators must be used in the context of a comprehensive respiratory protection program as required under OSHA\u2019s Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134). This includes fit testing, medical evaluation and training of the worker. When required in the occupational setting, tight-fitting respirators cannot be used by people with facial hair that interferes with the face seal.\n\nWhen respirators are used on a voluntary basis in an occupational setting, requirements for voluntary use of respirators in work sites can be found on the OSHA websiteExternal Web Site Icon.\n\nEmployers should continue to evaluate workplace hazards related to the 2009 H1N1 situation in accordance with CDC and OSHA guidance. Mandatory use of respiratory protection may be required when work activities in occupational settings confer risk that is task/function based, and risk analyses conducted by the employer could identify hazardous work activities. For example, performing activities which generate large amounts of aerosols require respiratory protection regardless of the setting in which it is performed (i.e. in a hospital, an outpatient setting, a prison).\n\nFor additional information on facemasks and respirators, see the CDC/NIOSH website, the Food and Drug Administration websiteExternal Web Site Icon, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration websiteExternal Web Site Icon.\n\ntop of page\n\nGroups at Higher Risk for Severe Illness from 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) Infection\nGroups of people at higher risk for severe illness from 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection are thought to be the same as those people at higher risk for severe illness from seasonal influenza. These groups include:\n\nChildren younger than 5 years old\nPersons aged 65 years or older\nChildren and adolescents (younger than 18 years) who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy and who might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection\nPregnant women\nAdults and children who have asthma, chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic, hematological, neurologic, neuromuscular, or metabolic disorders such as diabetes;\nAdults and children who have immunosuppression (including immunosuppression caused by medications or by HIV)\nResidents of nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities. \nTable 1.

Respirator\nThe effectiveness of respirators and facemasks in preventing transmission of 2009 H1N1 (or seasonal influenza) in various settings is not known. Use of a facemask or respirator is likely to be of most benefit if used correctly and consistently when exposed to an ill person.  (Ref. a) MacIntyre CR, et al.  EID 2009;15:233-41. b) Cowling BJ, et al. Non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent household transmission of influenza. The 8th Asia Pacific Congress of Medical Virology, Hong Kong, 26-28 February 2009.)\n\nFor the purpose of this document, respirator refers to N95 or any other NIOSH-certified filtering face piece respirator.\n\nPersons at increased risk of severe illness from influenza (i.e. high-risk persons) include those groups at higher risk for severe illness from seasonal influenza, including:  children younger than 5 years old;  persons aged 65 years or older;  children and adolescents (younger than 18 years) who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy and who might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection;  pregnant women;  adults and children who have pulmonary, including asthma, cardiovascular, hepatic, hematological, neurologic, neuromuscular, or metabolic disorders, such as diabetes; adults and children who have immunosuppression (including immunosuppression caused by medications or by HIV); and, residents of nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities.\n\nThe optimal use of respirators requires fit testing, training and medical clearance. Proper use is recommended to maximize effectiveness. The use of facemasks may be considered as an alternative to respirators, although they are not as effective as respirators in preventing inhalation of small particles, which is one potential route of influenza transmission.  There is limited evidence available to suggest that use of a respirator without fit-testing may still provide better protection than a facemask against inhalation of small particles. Respirators are not recommended for children or persons who have facial hair (see FDA websiteExternal Web Site Icon).\n\nUse of N95 respirators or facemasks generally is not recommended for workers in non-healthcare occupational settings for general work activities.  For specific work activities that involve contact with people who have influenza-like illness (ILI) (fever plus at least either cough or sore throat and possibly other symptoms like runny nose, body aches, headaches, chills, fatigue, vomiting and diarrhea), such as escorting a person with ILI, interviewing a person with ILI, providing assistance to an individual with ILI, the following are recommended: a) workers should try to maintain a distance of 6 feet or more from the person with ILI; b) workers should keep their interactions with the ill person as brief as possible; c) the ill person should be asked to follow good cough etiquette and hand hygiene and to wear a facemask, if able, and one is available; d) workers at increased risk of severe illness from influenza infection (see footnote 3) should avoid people with ILI (possibly by temporary reassignment); and, e) where workers cannot avoid close contact with persons with ILI, some workers may choose to wear a facemask or N95 respirator on a voluntary basis  (See footnote 1). When respirators are used on a voluntary basis in an occupational work setting, requirements for voluntary use of respirators in work sites can be found on the OSHA websiteExternal Web Site Icon.\n\nSee case definitions of confirmed, probable, and suspected 2009 influenza A (H1N1). Also see infection control in the health care setting. When respiratory protection is required in an occupational setting, respirators must be used in the context of a comprehensive respiratory protection program as required under OSHA\u2019s Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134). This includes fit testing, medical evaluation and training of the worker.\n\n\u201cCaring\u201d includes all activities that bring a worker into proximity to a patient with known, probable, or suspected 2009 H1N1 or ILI, including both providing direct medical care and support activities like delivering a meal tray or cleaning a patient\u2019s room.\n\nTable 2.

At that time, there were 118,000 cases in 114 countries, with more than 90% of those infections reported in just four countries. As of Friday, there were more than 28 million cases in 214 countries. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said yesterday that the WHO program aimed at speeding global access to coronavirus tests, treatments and vaccines needs $35 billion to scale up.\nThe United States remains the most impacted country, with almost 6.4 million cases. While nearly 30 US states are reporting downward trends in Covid-19 cases, the US is still seeing about 36,000 new Covid-19 cases a day. That's fewer than in mid-August when the number was almost 80,000 a day, but \"still too high,\" according to Fauci. \"I keep looking at that curve and I get more depressed and more depressed about the fact that we never really get down to the baseline that I'd like,\" he said.\nFauci predicted the US will continue to see coronavirus surges, although he dismissed the idea that this will be a second wave of the pandemic. \"I don't talk about second surges because we're still in the first surge,\" he said. \"We're going to see these surges that we've seen in the southern states, in the Midwest and now, if you look at the map, it's Montana, North and South Dakota, Michigan, Minnesota, Iowa.\"\nYOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED\nQ: My kid hates the idea of nasal swabs. Is there a saliva test for Covid-19?\nA: The SalivaDirect test could soon be a fast and cheap option. \"We simplified the test so that it only costs a couple of dollars for reagents, and we expect that labs will only charge about $10 per sample,\" said Nathan Grubaugh, one of the Yale researchers who developed the test.\nThe SalivaDirect test can produce results in less than three hours, and the accuracy is on par with results from traditional nasal swabbing. The Yale researchers said it might become publicly available in the coming weeks.\nSend your questions here. Are you a health care worker fighting Covid-19?

The nation of 1.3 billion people added 96,551 new cases on Friday.\nWith more than 4.5 million cases, India is the world's second-worst impacted country after the US. But its reported mortality rate -- calculated by the number of deaths per 100 confirmed cases -- is surprisingly low compared to other countries with high infection rates.\nThe Indian government claims the lower death rate is a sign of its success in handling the crisis and has used the figure to support its decision to lift some coronavirus restrictions. But some experts warn that the data is full of gaps, Jessie Yeung and Manveena Suri report. Adults with Covid-19 are much more likely to have visited a restaurant\nPeople who tested positive for Covid-19 were approximately twice as likely to have reported dining at a restaurant in the 14 days before becoming ill than those who tested negative, according to a new study from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe researchers took a close look at how patients responded to questions about wearing masks and various community-based activities, including whether they recently ate at a restaurant, hung out a bar or went to a gym, for instance.\nThey found that 42% of the adults who tested positive reported having close contact with at least one person known to have Covid-19, compared with 14% of those who tested negative. Most of the close contacts, 51%, were family members.\nAstraZeneca says it could still have vaccine approval by end of 2020\nAstraZeneca should still be on track to have a set of data to submit for approval of a Covid-19 vaccine before the end of the year, despite having to pause the trial because of an illness in a volunteer, CEO Pascal Soriot said yesterday.\nThe drug company said Tuesday it had temporarily halted the trial because of the volunteer's unexplained illness. The WHO's Chief Scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan said yesterday that the pause was normal procedure and good clinical practice.\nRegulators will examine the data to determine when and if the trial can proceed.\nA 40-year party could finally be over\nIbiza is perhaps the best-known Balearic island, attracting everyone from celebrities who arrive on superyachts, to planeloads of young British and German tourists looking for a good time. But thanks to a summer characterized by quarantines, shuttered nightclubs and canceled flights, the Balearic Islands -- alongside other European party hotspots across the Mediterranean -- are suffering from an abysmal hangover without even having enjoyed the night before, Francesca Street reports.\nON OUR RADAR\nThe number of vacant Manhattan apartments climbed to a record 15,025 in August.\n\"Saturday Night Live\" is heading back to 30 Rock for the first time since March.\nThe UK sent millions of workers home for the pandemic.

So CNN Business' Kathryn Vasel asked career experts for some solutions to common work-from-home problems and concerns. Here's what she found out:\nYou're worried about your career: Now that almost everyone in your company is working from home, you might have more access to meetings and conversations that only higher-level executives used to attend. Ask to join those meetings. You can learn new information, meet new people and find new opportunities.\nMotivation is lacking: Time can seem pretty meaningless these days. Before you know it, several hours have passed and you haven't been as productive as you should have. Create a schedule that blocks off time for things like work that requires deep thought, creative thinking, meetings and emails.\nYou feel overworked: Remember when you sat at your desk for eight hours straight in the office? Yeah, me neither. Add breaks into your schedule.

            "Text": "(CNN)People who let down their guard and got too close to others over Labor Day weekend should get tested for Covid-19, White House coronavirus task coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said.\n\nMuch of the coronavirus spread by people who don't have symptoms is happening between and within families and in settings such as neighborhood parties, Birx said Thursday at a media briefing at the University of South Carolina.\nPeople who socialized closely with others, especially without a mask, should get tested, Birx said.\n\"Just because we know someone, we think that there's no way that they could have Covid, but I want to tell you, you can't tell,\" said Birx.\n\"We really encourage all of you to continue to get tested when you've had that kind of exposure, so we can stop community spread,\" she added.\n\"Our nature is to want to be with others and socialize,\" Birx told reporters. \"What we're asking people to do is to socialize smart.\"\nGiven that people can't eat and drink while wearing masks, the results of a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study may not be surprising.\nIn the study, adults who tested positive for Covid-19 were about twice as likely to have reported dining at a restaurant in the 14 days before becoming ill than those who tested negative.\n\"Reports of exposures in restaurants have been linked to air circulation. Direction, ventilation, and intensity of airflow might affect virus transmission, even if social distancing measures and mask use are implemented according to current guidance,\" researchers wrote.\n\"Masks cannot be effectively worn while eating and drinking, whereas shopping and numerous other indoor activities do not preclude mask use.\"\nUniversities and colleges in all 50 states report cases\nAs schools begin their fall semester, universities and colleges are struggling to contain coronavirus outbreaks, with cases reported at campuses in all 50 states.\nMore than 40,000 Covid-19 infections have been reported among students, faculty and staff at colleges and universities nationwide. The number represents cases that CNN has reported so far -- with the actual tally likely higher due to a lag from schools that update their data every few days. With social life trickling back to life on campuses, outbreaks have hit places students congregate, such as fraternities and sororities, where some have continued to gather despite remote learning.\nA cluster of Covid-19 cases was linked to a fraternity party at the University of New Hampshire. More than 100 people attended the August 29 event and few wore masks. Eleven people connected to the party have tested positive for the virus, university officials said.\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison is directing all undergraduate students to restrict their movements for the next two weeks in an attempt to reverse the rise in Covid-19 cases.\nIn a memo to students, faculty and staff this week, Chancellor Rebecca Blank called on students to severely limit in-person interactions and stay in their residences except for essential activities. The university directed nine campus fraternities and sororities with off-campus live-in houses to quarantine for at least 14 days.\nIllinois' Bradley University on Tuesday told all of its more than 4,500 students to quarantine in their on-campus or off-campus residences for two weeks, and to attend only online classes during that time, with allowances for meal pickups and other errands.\nThough the school had less than 50 positive cases on campus, those cases led to 500 people being put in quarantine, so the school said it decided to have everybody reset.\nSome of the highest number of cases are at Miami University, University of South Carolina, Ohio State University and East Carolina University, all of which have over 1,000 confirmed cases. The University of Missouri has 862 confirmed cases while Missouri State University has 791, a CNN tally shows.\nWhile most students will likely recover, health experts have expressed concern that young people would spread the virus to the more vulnerable in their communities. Experts stress importance of flu vaccine during coronavirus pandemic\nAs cases accumulate on campuses, experts have warned that the country as a whole could see a resurgence of coronavirus cases this fall on top of flu season. A large concern is that the US could see the \"perfect storm of accelerated Covid-19 activity, as people gather more inside, in particular -- as they become continually fatigued with the mask wearing, the social distancing, and the hand hygiene, and as they are exposed to seasonal influenza,\" Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo said Thursday.\nMarrazzo, director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, made the comment during a briefing by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\n\"If there was ever a naysayer, someone who's never been vaccinated (for flu), now's the time to rise,\" Dr. Leonard Mermel, medical director for the Department of Epidemiology and Infection Control at Rhode Island Hospital, said at the same briefing. \"Get the vaccine and reduce the risk of having these two life-threatening viruses infect you at the same time, or infect one of your loved ones,\" he said.\nFor now, rates of new daily coronavirus infections reported nationwide have been dropping after a summer surge.\nThe seven-day average of new daily reported infections in the US was about 35,300 as of Wednesday, down from a peak average of 67,317 on July 22, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\nThe country's Covid-19 death rate also has dipped. The seven-day average of new daily deaths was 734 Wednesday, after it was above 1,000 from late July to August 20, JUH data show.\nCases aren't falling in every state. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said Wednesday that his state's statistics were \"getting worse by the day,\" and urged residents to do more to combat the spread.\nWest Virginia's seven-day average of new daily cases was 165 on Wednesday, up from around 100 at the end of August and around 50 at the start of July.\n\"This situation right now is really critical,\" Justice said.\nGiroir says he's 'never been told to slow down testing'\nThe coronavirus testing lead for the White House coronavirus task force said Thursday that he has never been told to slow testing, and the country is continuing to increase its testing capacity. \"I have never been told to slow down testing, or to reduce our efforts -- and in fact, we built on testing every single month,\" Adm. Brett Giroir, a physician and the assistant secretary for health at the US Department of Health and Human Services, told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta during a Research! America forum.\nHis comments come a day after experts said the US should be performing as many as 200 million Covid-19 tests every month to have any chance of controlling the pandemic. That report, from the Rockefeller Foundation and the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy, said fewer than 30 million tests are currently reported monthly in the country.\nGiroir said that \"this month, we should have the availability of over 100 million tests, and between 55% and 60% of those -- that's 55 to 60 million -- will be rapid point of care.\"\n\"This really puts us at an inflection point that we can really protect the elderly, we could protect the vulnerable, and we can do those kinds of screening testing for schools and work that we've been talking about for months now we have the tools to do that,\" Giroir told Gupta.\nDoctor expresses fury about 'misinformation'\nA frontline doctor is among those expressing fury over revelations that President Donald Trump downplayed the deadly threat from coronavirus early in the pandemic. In a series of interviews, Trump told investigative reporter Bob Woodward that he downplayed the danger because he didn't want people to panic.\nDr. Craig Spencer, the director of Global Health in ER Medicine at NY-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, expressed his anger at the disclosure.\n\"I'm furious because you want to talk about panic and wanting to reduce panic -- I think of the panic of every single family I called on FaceTime to let them know their family member was dying or had died,\" Spencer told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday. \"And I think about that multiplied by 190,000 times around this country.\"\nIt's \"almost impossible\" for health professionals to keep up with and correct the President's misinformation, he said.",

Experts -- including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director -- have warned the months ahead will be challenging. The US continues to see about 36,000 new cases each day -- which is better than August but still too high, Fauci said.\n\"I keep looking at that curve and I get more depressed and more depressed about the fact that we never really get down to the baseline that I'd like,\" he said.\nFactors could drive Covid-19 numbers up this fall. Colleges have become hotspots. And when students return home -- which health officials have urged against -- they could transmit the virus to more communities.\nAs the weather gets colder, Americans will move indoors more, where the virus spreads more easily.\nThe coming flu season will complicate diagnoses. The strains on the healthcare system will make for one of the \"most difficult times that we experienced in American public health,\" CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield has said.\nWhere we stand now\nThe US has had more than 6.4 million reported infections. At least 192,381 people have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\nThe actual number of infections could be far greater. Many may have had Covid-19 without knowing, as the CDC projects about 40% of people who are infected don't show any symptoms. Others could have been sick but never got tested. A new study says the US greatly undercounted Covid-19 cases at the start of the pandemic -- missing 90% of them -- mostly due to a lack in testing.\nAcross the US, 28 states are reporting downward trends -- including Florida and California -- compared to the previous week, and 14 are steady.\nExperts worry a surge could come weeks after Labor Day celebrations, like cases soared after the Fourth of July.\nAn ensemble forecast from the CDC now projects that between 205,000 and 217,000 people in the US will die by October 3.\nNon-symptomatic children can transmit virus, data show\nEven children with mild or no symptoms can transmit Covid-19, according to contact tracing data from three Utah child care facilities released Friday.\nResearchers said 12 children got Covid-19 in a child care location and transmitted it to at least 12 people outside, including household members.\nThey analyzed contact tracing data from 184 people with links to three child care centers in Salt Lake County from this April to July.\nThey found at least two children who had no symptoms not only had caught the virus but passed it to other people, including one mother who was hospitalized. One 8-month-old child spread the virus to both parents.\nThe researchers say that two of the facility outbreaks began with staff members who had household contacts with the virus.\nOverall, children accounted for 13 of the 31 confirmed Covid-19 case linked to the facility, and all of the children had mild or no symptoms.\nHere's what will help\nThings will begin turning around once a vaccine is widely available, Fauci says. But the approval for one is still likely months away, despite President Trump's claims that a vaccine could be available by Election Day.\nDr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, told CBS this week the likelihood a vaccine will be widely accessible this year is \"extremely low.\" Health officials including Fauci have said the vaccine is likely to be available for use by late this year or early next year. In the meantime, the CDC has advised states to begin preparing to distribute the vaccine.\nBut until the US has a vaccine, there are still ways to help curb the spread of the virus.\nFace coverings remain the most powerful tool to fight transmission.\nIf 95% of Americans wore face masks, more than 120,000 lives could be saved by January 1, experts with the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation project.\nInfected college students shouldn't be sent home\nColleges across the country have made face masks a requirement hoping to keep Covid-19 cases down. But just weeks into the first semester, campuses from all 50 states have reported infections. The University of Texas at Austin announced this week three confirmed clusters on campus which collectively account for about 100 cases. San Diego State University confirmed almost 400 infections among students, after announcing a halt on in-person instruction.\nAnd more than 1,300 Arizona State University students have tested positive since August 1.\nColleges and universities should try to isolate infected students instead of sending them home, Fauci has said. \"You send them back to their community, you will in essence be reseeding with individuals who are capable of transmitting infection, many communities throughout the country,\" he said earlier this week.\n\"So it's much, much better to have the capability to put them in a place where they could comfortably recover.\"",

            "HeadLine": "A new front in coronavirus disinformation: Wall Street research",
            "Text": "New York (CNN)Coronavirus misinformation is infecting the unlikeliest of places: Wall Street research that investors rely on to trade in the financial markets.\n\nIn an early August note to clients, an analyst at a research firm called Fundstrat Global Advisors, which distributes widely-read reports and analysis to investors, cited a series of tweets by an ophthalmologist named James Todaro who painted a rosy picture of the US population's potential for developing herd immunity to coronavirus.\nIn a research note sent to clients on August 11th, Fundstrat co-founder Thomas J. Lee included four tweets Todaro sent the previous day. One of Todaro's tweets cited \"growing evidence that T cell immunity allows populations to reach herd immunity once 10-20% are infected with SARS CoV-2,\" the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.\nTodaro's claim is not supported by credible scientific research. In fact, Shane Crotty, an immunologist at the Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, told CNN Business that Todaro's tweets are \"dangerous\" to public health. The presence of Todaro's tweets in a Wall Street research note suggests the campaign to downplay the virus championed by the president and his supporters is gaining traction. Todaro is one of the people who appeared in a viral video in July promoting hydroxychloroquine that Facebook and YouTube later removed because they said it was promoting misinformation.\nCNN confirmed that Todaro received a medical degree in 2014 from Columbia University's Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, but he does not appear to have practiced medicine beyond the end of his residency at the Kresge Eye Institute in Detroit in 2018, according to his LinkedIn profile and tweets.\nHe last performed eye surgery in 2018 \"before stepping away from ophthalmology to focus exclusively on blockchain and cryptocurrency,\" according to Todaro's profile on the website of Blocktown Capital, a blockchain firm he started.\nCoronavirus misinformation\nWhile coronavirus misinformation is ubiquitous on social media, there's an expectation that Wall Street research is more reliable than the kind of information that winds up in most people's Facebook feeds. Analysts funnel research into a private pipeline that influences whether paying clients feel bullish or bearish about the economy, corporate profits and, more recently, the trajectory of the coronavirus.\n\"There should be a difference between Wall Street research and what's available on the internet. It's just that simple,\" said one hedge fund manager, who insists that clients who pay for information and analysis expect it to be well vetted and researched. This person isn't a Fundstrat client but was reacting to the Todaro tweets that Lee included in his note.\nIn his note, Lee cautioned that Todaro's assertion on T cells was \"not proven,\" and said that \"we are not healthcare experts, so take our commentary with a grain of salt.\" But Lee elevated Todaro's interpretation of science without mentioning Todaro's lack of expertise in immunology or epidemiology.\nLee, Fundstrat's co-founder and head of research, is a 25-year industry veteran who has appeared on CNBC, Fox Business, Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg more than a dozen times this year. He was on CNN Business as recently as last month.\nIn response to repeated and detailed requests for comment, Lee did not address any of the specific claims in his August 11th note, sent by email to clients. Instead, he referred CNN Business to an article that cited Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, saying that it is \"conceivable\" that common cold T cells \"could have some degree of protection.\"\nProviding some degree of protection has little to do with herd immunity, which comes only after many people have either been effected and recovered, or vaccinated. Doctors say trying to achieve herd immunity by allowing coronavirus to simply make its way unimpeded through the population could cost 2 million American lives.\nAn industry veteran\nBefore co-founding Fundstrat in 2014, Lee worked at J.P. Morgan for seven years, according to his Fundstrat bio. He served as the chief US equity strategist within J.P. Morgan's investment bank before leaving.\nOn its \"About Us\" web page, Fundstrat says that it focuses \"on delivering analysis, not opinions, and as an independent research provider, our clients are assured that our work is tailored to provide fresh and innovative intelligence to aid in their investment process.\"\nLee has been praised by some financial observers for correctly predicting the market's strong rebound from its March lows.\nSo when Lee included a string of Todaro's tweets in a note to clients on August 11th, it alarmed another industry insider, Michael Cembalest, chairman of Market and Investment Strategy for J.P. Morgan Asset Management. A person familiar with the bank's research relationships confirmed that Fundstrat is one of J.P. Morgan's many research providers.\nCembalest took issue with the Todaro tweets Lee cited, which suggested that \"some kind of herd immunity is reached\" when \"a community has 10-20 percent infection rate.\"\n\"It was one of the more disturbing pieces of research I've seen in 33 years in this industry,\" said Cembalest, in a note to JP Morgan clients several days later. \"Misinformation and mindless regurgitation of poorly vetted sources are, in my view, part of the reasons why\" the United States is behind other developed countries in controlling the virus, Cembalest wrote in his August 18th note.\nLee's inclusion of Todaro's tweets \"was highly misleading, as the casual reader would infer that they were from an authoritative source and not from someone with no special training in the area and who had left the medical field,\" said Georgetown University associate professor James J. Angel, who specializes in regulation of global financial markets and reviewed Lee's August 11th note at CNN's request.\nWhen misinformation winds up in Wall Street research notes, it influences the way investors think, according to Cembalest. \"It's like defense attorneys who can say something that gets stricken from the record, but it gets retained in the minds of the jurors,\" Cembalest said.\nA controversial tweet\nCembalest was also disturbed by Lee including another Todaro tweet in his August 11th note, which suggested that the \"coronavirus vaccine industry\" had an incentive to push for lockdowns and masks. Lee described the tweet as \"noteworthy, not because it is true,\" but because it \"highlights the complex incentives.\"\nLee added that \"experts dismiss steroids or HCQ [hydroxychloroquine] as treatment regimes, because it could also not be that profitable,\" without providing evidence to support that statement.\nBut in June a panel at the National Institutes of Health recommended the common steroid dexamethasone \u2014 which suppresses inflammation -- in patients with severe and critical Covid-19.\nCembalest told CNN that Lee's August note isn't the first time he believes Lee trafficked in unproven theories without offering legitimate sources. For example, Cembalest provided CNN with an April email exchange between the two men where Lee wrote, \"I think the US states/hospitals are now seeing incentives to report higher cases.\" There's no evidence to support this assertion.\nQuestionable sources\nTodaro's Michigan medical license and license to prescribe controlled substances both lapsed in June 2019, according to that state's Department of Licensing and Regulation. Todaro, when asked about his credentials and Dr. Crotty's criticism, replied that Crotty should \"look at what's happening in the real world.\"\nYet Todaro's lack of recent practice hasn't prevented him from spreading dubious theories about coronavirus on his widely-viewed social media accounts -- or becoming a darling of the right-wing media.\nTodaro co-wrote a widely criticized paper in March touting hydroxychloroquine as an effective treatment for coronavirus, which he posted as a Google Doc. After Tesla founder Elon Musk blasted the paper out to his Twitter followers, it was cited by Breitbart News and The Blaze, and one of Todaro's co-authors went on Tucker Carlson's Fox News show to tout it as a potential cure -- the same day Trump started promoting the drug in his press briefings. More recently, Todaro was a guest on Steve Bannon's podcast.\nOne of the people listed as a co-author of Todaro's paper subsequently asked to be removed from the paper, saying he had nothing to do with writing it. Later, as other studies raised doubts about hydroxychloroquine's effectiveness and safety in treating Covid-19, Todaro's paper was temporarily blocked by Google. Links on Twitter now warn that it could be \"potentially spammy or unsafe.\"\nA viral video\nIn July, Todaro appeared in a viral video of doctors promoting hydroxychloroquine speaking on the steps of the United States Supreme Court. The video -- which was retweeted by Trump, his son Donald Trump, Jr. and other conservative figures -- showed Todaro and other doctors in white gowns with the words \"America's Frontline Doctors\" stitched in blue on their chests as they promoted hydroxychloroquine. Other physicians in the video include Stella Immanuel, a Houston doctor who has claimed that alien DNA is used in some medical treatments.\nIn late July, after that video was taken down, Todaro and several of the other doctors in the video met with Vice President Mike Pence. \"Doctors everywhere should be able to prescribe hydroxychloroquine without repercussions or obstruction,\" Todaro tweeted after the meeting.\nMore recently, Todaro has shifted his focus to the idea that the immune system's response to the common cold could play a role in herd immunity.\nTodaro bases his theory on recently published articles in respected scientific journals citing research that shows about 50 percent of the US population has T cells that can recognize the novel coronavirus even though these individuals never had Covid-19. The body's immune system produces T cells in response to infections, including some coronaviruses that can cause the common cold and that are very similar to SARS CoV-2.\nBut the presence of these T cells doesn't mean that 50 percent of the population is immune to Covid-19, according to Crotty, the immunologist who co-led a study on T cells and antibodies.\n\"Todaro was saying 'don't worry, we're basically there on herd immunity and this is going to be over by October,'\" said Crotty, who called out Todaro on Twitter for misrepresenting T cell research. \"That's not what our data says, and that's not the way the immune system works and this isn't the way herd immunity works. It's just incorrect.\"\nAlthough Lee acknowledged in his note that Todaro's viewpoint was controversial, he didn't mention that Todaro's previous attempts to spread misinformation have been debunked. There's no evidence that Lee has updated his clients to reflect that one of the lead researchers in T cells had denounced Todaro's tweets.\nLee has not responded to CNN's request for confirmation that he has updated Fundstrat's clients on either of these issues.",

Over the following months, additional airports began the process of checking passengers from high-risk countries. For a brief period, the screenings resulted in long lines and overcrowded conditions at US airports.\nThe administration now appears set to end those screenings, a move first reported by Yahoo News. US Customs and Border Protection deferred comment to the Department of Homeland Security, which declined to comment. An administration official told CNN that a draft public affairs guidance memo lays out the rationale for ending airport screening: Of the 675,000 passengers screened at 15 airports, fewer than 15 had been identified as having Covid-19. Airlines for America, an aviation industry group, agreed with the decision to cease screenings, saying in a statement: \"We continue to support spending scarce screening resources where they can best be utilized and no longer believe that it makes sense to continue screening at these 15 airports given the extremely low number of passengers identified by the (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) as potentially having a health issue.\"\nIt's been difficult to measure the effectiveness of the screenings. Data provided to the House Oversight Committee earlier this year revealed few passengers were stopped in initial screenings of international flights from early coronavirus hotspots outside of China.\nThe screenings included questions about medical history, current condition and contact information for local health authorities.",

            "HeadLine": "Yes, you can have Covid-19 and the flu at the same time. Here's what that could do to your body",
            "Text": "(CNN)As doctors worry about a coronavirus-and-flu \"twin-demic\" that could overwhelm the health care system, Americans must contend with another possibility: fighting both viruses at the same time.\n\n\"You can certainly get both the flu and Covid-19 at the same time, which could be catastrophic to your immune system,\" said Dr. Adrian Burrowes, a family medicine physician in Florida.\nIn fact, getting infected with one can make you more vulnerable to getting sick with the other, epidemiologist Dr. Seema Yasmin said.\n\"Once you get infected with the flu and some other respiratory viruses, it weakens your body,\" said Yasmin, director of the Stanford Health Communication Initiative. \"Your defenses go down, and it makes you vulnerable to getting a second infection on top of that.\"\nOn their own, both Covid-19 and the flu can attack the lungs, potentially causing pneumonia, fluid in the lungs or respiratory failure, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\nEach illness can also cause sepsis, cardiac injury and inflammation of the heart, brain or muscle tissues.\nHaving both illness simultaneously \"would increase the risk of longer-term effects of any of those organ systems,\" said Dr. Michael Matthay, a professor of medicine and a critical care specialist at the University of California, San Francisco.\nBut it's too early to know exactly how much worse that double whammy could be, compared to having each virus on its own.\nThat's because Covid-19 didn't spread across the US until near the end of the last flu season, Matthay said. So there's not a lot of data yet on people who get both illnesses at the same time. But Matthay suspects the potential for pneumonia would be greater if the body is infected with both the flu and coronavirus.\n\"The two (viruses) together definitely could be more injurious to the lungs and cause more respiratory failure,\" he said.\nRespiratory failure doesn't necessarily mean your lungs stop working. It means the lungs can't get enough oxygen into the blood.\n\"Acute respiratory failure can be a life-threatening emergency,\" the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute says. \"Respiratory failure may cause damage to your lungs and other organs, so it is important to get treated quickly.\"\nHow can I tell if I have Covid-19 or the flu (or both)?\n\"Symptoms of influenza and Covid-19 are pretty similar, so it's difficult to distinguish the two,\" said Dr. Leonard Mermel, medical director for the Department of Epidemiology and Infection Control at Rhode Island Hospital.\nBoth the flu and Covid-19 can give you a fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, sore throat, body aches and a runny or stuffy nose, the CDC said. \"Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults,\" the CDC said.\nBut unlike the flu, Covid-19 can cause a loss of taste or smell.\nAnd about half of coronavirus transmissions happen between people who don't show any symptoms. (Many of those people are pre-symptomatic and are more contagious before they start showing symptoms.)\nSo the best way to know if you have the novel coronavirus or the flu (or both) is to get tested.\nThe CDC has created a test that will check for both viruses, to be used at CDC-supported public health labs. The agency said it is continuing to manufacture and distribute these tests.\nHow can I avoid this flu-Covid-19 double whammy?\nWear a mask and keep physical distancing. Health officials have stressed the importance of masks and physical distancing if Americans want to control Covid-19 -- and get the economy back on track.\nWith the imminent flu season, such precautions can \"doubly protect us from both of those viruses,\" Yasmin said.\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, which is just ending its winter months and flu season, several countries have reported astonishingly low flu numbers as people wear masks and social distance. In Australia, for example, the number of lab-confirmed flu cases plummeted from 61,000 in August 2019 to 107 cases this August.\nBut in the US, some people are getting lax about mask wearing and social distancing. And that's a big problem, said Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\nShe said there could be a \"perfect storm of accelerated Covid-19 activity, as people gather more -- inside, in particular -- as they become continually fatigued with the mask wearing, the social distancing and the hand hygiene, and as they are exposed to seasonal influenza.\"\nGet a flu vaccine. This may sound obvious. Yet about half of all Americans don't get vaccinated against the flu, including most children who die from the flu.\nEven if you get a flu shot and still catch the flu later, the symptoms are usually less severe than if you got no flu vaccine at all.\nAnd since no Covid-19 vaccine is publicly available yet, the flu shot is the only way you can help inoculate yourself against having both viruses at the same time. Pediatricians say it's important for children 6 months and older to get the flu vaccine, ideally before the end of October. \"Timely influenza vaccination is particularly important\" this flu season, the American Academy of Pediatrics wrote this week.\nGetting a flu shot can also help many more people than just yourself, said immunologist Dr. Susan Bailey, president of the American Medical Association.\n\"Since hospitals and doctors' offices are going to be very busy caring for Covid-19 patients, a flu vaccine can help decrease burdens on the health care system and make sure that those who need medical care are able to get it,\" Bailey said.\nAbout 140,000 to 810,000 Americans get hospitalized with the flu each year, according to the CDC. And the number of Covid-19 hospitalizations are expected to surge more than 150% between now and December 1, according to the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.\n\"Every year, many patients get severe influenza with respiratory failure,\" Matthay said. Among patients who get severe pneumonia from the flu, \"the vast majority of those patients have not had their flu vaccine that year.\"",

            "Text": "(CNN)Drug giant AstraZeneca said Tuesday it had paused global trials of its coronavirus vaccine because of an unexplained illness in one of the volunteers.\n\n\"As part of the ongoing randomized, controlled global trials of the Oxford coronavirus vaccine, our standard review process triggered a pause to vaccination to allow review of safety data,\" the company said in a statement sent to CNN. National Institutes of Health director Dr. Francis Collins told a Senate hearing Wednesday that it's a standard precaution in vaccine trials meant to ensure experimental vaccines don't cause serious reactions among participants.\n\"To have a clinical hold, as has been placed on AstraZeneca, as of yesterday, because of a single serious adverse event, is not at all unprecedented,\" Collins said at a hearing of the Senate Heath, Education, Labor and Pensions committee.\nThe company is testing its vaccine, called the Oxford vaccine because it was developed with Britain's University of Oxford, in the United States as well as the UK, Latin America, Asia, Europe and Africa.\n\"This is a routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials, while it is investigated, ensuring we maintain the integrity of the trials,\" the statement added.\n\"In large trials, illnesses will happen by chance but must be independently reviewed to check this carefully. We are working to expedite the review of the single event to minimize any potential impact on the trial timeline. We are committed to the safety of our participants and the highest standards of conduct in our trials.\" Earlier Tuesday, AstraZeneca joined eight other companies in signing a pledge promising they would not seek premature government approval for any coronavirus vaccine. They promised they would wait until they had adequate data showing any potential vaccine worked safely.\n\"We, the undersigned biopharmaceutical companies, want to make clear our on-going commitment to developing and testing potential vaccines for COVID-19 in accordance with high ethical standards and sound scientific principles,\" the statement read. It was signed by the CEOs of AstraZeneca, BioNTech GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer and Sanofi.\n\"We believe this pledge will help ensure public confidence in the rigorous scientific and regulatory process by which COVID-19 vaccines are evaluated and may ultimately be approved,\" they added. The AstraZeneca vaccine is one of three coronavirus vaccines in late-stage, Phase 3 trials in the US. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) usually monitors trials for adverse events and can order a pause or halt a trial, but AstraZeneca did not say who had stopped the trial.\nCommon adverse events in vaccine trials include fever, headache, soreness at the injection site and muscle pain.\nRegulators and companies alike have been working to ensure people trust in the vaccine authorization process. The US Food and Drug Administration must give either emergency use authorization or full approval to any vaccine before it can be distributed in the US.\n\"This ought to be reassuring to everybody listening,\" Collins said at the hearing.\nPresident Trump has said repeatedly he thinks at least one of the vaccines could be ready before Election Day on November 3. Most groups working on the vaccine say that is extremely unlikely but Biontech CEO and co-founder Ugur Sahin told CNN earlier Tuesday he believes the vaccine his company is developing with Pfizer could be ready for regulatory approval by mid-October. Dr. Tony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said it's technically possible that if a DSMB saw strong evidence a vaccine was working before a trial was completed, it could recommend a halt to the trial so more people could get the vaccine. But Fauci said this was unlikely to happen before December.\nHowever, discussions about early authorizations and reports about White House pressure to speed along a vaccine have worried the public, as well as former FDA officials. Former FDA commissioner Dr. Robert Califf told CNN last week he was concerned even before Covid-19 that Trump would pressure the FDA to make decisions he wanted. \"One of the things that's had me on pins and needles the last four years is literally Trump could do this with any drug or device or vaccine anytime he wants to,\" said Califf, who was commissioner from January 2016 through January 2018.\nFauci and FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn have said they would not cave into political interference.",

He told a Monday news briefing that, \"we're going to have a vaccine very soon. Maybe even before a very special date.\"\nWhile Trump did not specifically mention which date, he has previously suggested that a vaccine could be ready before Election Day. Meanwhile, health experts have said for weeks that the prospect of a shot being ready by then is highly unlikely.\nPharmaceutical companies are also pushing back against the prospect. Nine companies have signed an unusual pledge, released on Tuesday, to uphold \"high ethical standards,\" suggesting they won't seek premature government approval for Covid-19 vaccines.\nThe irony of all of this is many Americans may not even want the jab, partly due to the Trump administration's mixed and misleading messages, that could undermine confidence in the vaccine process. According to a new CBS News/YouGov poll, only 21% of voters nationwide said they would immediately seek out a vaccine if one was made available in 2020, while 65% said they believed a vaccine announced this year would, by definition, be the product of a \"rushed\" process. Only 35% would regard it positively, as a \"scientific achievement.\"\nYOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED\nQ: Can I catch Covid-19 from food or its packaging?\nA: It is highly unlikely that food is a source of coronavirus transmission, according to a team of experts on food contamination.\n\"To date, there has not been any evidence that food, food packaging or food handling is a source or important transmission route for SARS-CoV-2 resulting in Covid-19,\" the International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods said in a statement.\nThose findings mirror earlier reporting from the US Food and Drug Administration that there is no real risk of getting the virus from food or food packaging.\nSend your questions here.

In Brooklyn, authorities shut down a bar over the weekend after deputies found nearly 300 people packed inside. In Nashville, thousands flocked to the bars operating with restrictions, prompting the mayor to close down portions of a road to allow for more social distancing, Christina Maxouris reports.\nThis comes as experts offer a grim prediction on what the next few months could look like, with the pandemic stacking up against flu season and new fronts opening up, including schools and college campuses. \"We're heading into the fall and the winter, when we would expect a respiratory pathogen like a coronavirus to start spreading more aggressively than it would in the summertime,\" Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner said on CBS' Face the Nation. French Open tennis tournament to be played with fans\nThe French Tennis Federation announced Monday that the 2020 French Open will be open to fans when play begins later this month -- despite a rise in cases in the country. The Grand Slam event was originally scheduled for May but was postponed by the pandemic.\nBut world No. 1 Ashleigh Barty said she won't be in Paris to defend her French Open title. The Australian said in a statement that she would not be traveling to Europe in part because of the Covid-19 pandemic as well as factoring in her lack of preparedness to play at Roland Garros.\nSerena Williams has also expressed some reservations. After beating Maria Sakkari at the US Open, Williams said: \"I'm super conservative because I do have some serious health issues, so I try to stay away from public places, because I have been in a really bad position in the hospital a few times. So I don't want to end up in that position again, so I don't know. I'll just do my best to continue to keep -- for me, I try to keep a 12-foot distance instead of 6.\"\nSpain tops half a million infections\nSpain has passed the 500,000 mark after recording a further 2,440 Covid-19 cases on Monday, making it the first western European country to pass that threshold. It now has a total of 525,549 infections, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\nThis comes as the UK reported nearly 3,000 cases for two days in a row, marking the country's highest daily totals since May. Health minister Matt Hancock said he was concerned about the rise, which he said was primarily among \"affluent\" young people. Meanwhile, Denmark is restricting public gatherings in its capital and 17 other municipalities after seeing a \"worrying\" increase in cases, its health ministry said.\nMore soccer stars catch the virus, and others breach the rules\nFrench soccer star Kylian Mbappe tested positive for Covid-19 while on international duty, the French Football Federation announced on Monday. The 21-year-old is the seventh Paris Saint-Germain player to contract coronavirus in recent weeks. Manchester City footballers Riyad Mahrez and Aymeric Laporte have also tested positive, their club announced on the same day.\nMeanwhile, two England players -- Manchester City's Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood of Manchester United -- have been sent home for breaching coronavirus rules while in Iceland.\nThe England team was in Reykjavik following a 1-0 victory over Iceland in the Nations League. Since the win, Icelandic media outlet DV reported that the players were visited by two Icelandic women in their hotel.\nPfizer and BioNTech vaccine could be ready for approval by October, says BioNTech chief\nThe collaboration between Pfizer and BioNTech is confident it can have a vaccine ready for regulatory approval by the middle of October, BioNTech CEO and co-founder Ugur Sahin told CNN.\n\"It has an excellent profile and I consider this vaccine as a vaccine which is near perfect and which has a near perfect profile,\" Sahin said in an exclusive interview with CNN's Frederik Pleitgen. He added \"this provides us with a lot of confidence in combination with understanding of the mode of action. In combination with the safety data coming in from the running trial. Yes, we believe that we have a safe product and we believe that we will be able to show efficacy.\"\nSahin told CNN he believes the approval for emergency use will be granted quickly by regulatory authorities. US drug giant Pfizer and German firm BioNTech say they plan to provide 100 million doses of their vaccine candidate, BNT162, by the end of the year, and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.\nWhile Sahin said approval could happen by mid-October, federal officials have told CNN they believe this is an optimistic timeline.

Recent surveys by UNICEF and WHO have found the pandemic is disrupting child and maternal healthcare services worldwide, including prenatal and post-natal care, vaccinations and check-ups due to fewer resources and a fear of contracting Covid-19.\n\"The global community has come too far towards eliminating preventable child deaths to allow the COVID-19 pandemic to stop us in our tracks,\" UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said in a news release.\n\"When children are denied access to health services because the system is overrun, and when women are afraid to give birth at the hospital for fear of infection, they, too, may become casualties of COVID-19,\" Fore said.\n\"Without urgent investments to re-start disrupted health systems and services, millions of children under five, especially newborns, could die,\" she added.\nOut of 77 countries surveyed by UNICEF over the summer, 68% reported disruptions in childhood checkups and vaccinations. A WHO survey of 105 countries also found 52% reported interruptions in medical services for sick kids and 51% reported disruptions in malnutrition programs. These kinds of services are critical for preventing newborn and child deaths, WHO said, citing a statistic that pregnant women who see midwives are 16% less likely to lose their babies and 24% less likely to experience pre-term birth.\n\"The COVID-19 pandemic has put years of global progress to end preventable child deaths in serious jeopardy,\" Muhammad Ali Pate, the Global Director for Health, Nutrition and Population at the World Bank, said in a statement. \"It is essential to protect life-saving services which have been key to reducing child mortality.\nNewborns were at the highest risk of death, even before the coronavirus pandemic, with a baby dying every 13 seconds in 2019, the UNICEF mortality report said. They could be at a much higher risk of death with coronavirus-related disruptions in essential health services, according to WHO.\nJohns Hopkins University, which has been tracking the pandemic from the start, said modeling showed that disruptions in healthcare due to Covid-19 could cause the deaths of almost 6,000 additional children every day. Even though progress in childhood deaths is being made, the UNICEF mortality report also predicts that if current trends continue, 10 million 5-to-14-year-olds and 52 million children under 5 will still die between 2019 and 2030. \"Almost half of these under-five deaths will be newborns whose deaths could be prevented by providing high quality antenatal (prenatal) care, skilled care at birth, postnatal care for mothers and their babies, and care of small and sick newborns,\" the report said.\n\"Reducing inequalities is essential for ending these preventable childhood deaths and for ensuring that no child is left behind,\" the UNICEF report concluded.",

            "HeadLine": "Considerations for Use of SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Testing in Nursing Homes",
            "Text": "This document provides a summary of considerations for use of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) antigen testing in nursing homes and is intended for nursing home providers and state and local public health departments.\n\nAntigen tests are available as point-of-care (POC) diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2.  They have a rapid turnaround time, which is critical to the identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection and rapid implementation of infection prevention and control strategies. These tests can augment other testing efforts, especially in settings where RT-PCR testing capacity is limited or testing results are delayed (e.g., >48 hours). In general, these POC antigen tests have a lower sensitivity, but similar specificity, for detecting SARS-CoV-2 compared to reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests.\n\nThis document pertains to antigen tests that have been granted a US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Emergency Use Authorization (FDA EUA) to detect SARS-CoV-2. The first two SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests to receive FDA EUA are authorized for testing symptomatic persons within 5 days of symptom onset and there are limited data on antigen test performance in asymptomatic persons. However, given the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic and presymptomatic nursing home residents and healthcare personnel (HCP) with SARS-CoV-2 infection, CDC is providing considerations for the use of antigen tests in asymptomatic persons during this public health emergency. Facilities should be aware of the FDA EUAexternal icon for antigen testsexternal icon and potential implications for the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)external icon certificate of waiver when using antigen tests in asymptomatic individuals and in persons >5 days from symptom onset. When a confirmatory molecular test should be considered\nAs the sensitivity of antigen tests is generally lower than RT-PCR, FDA EUAexternal icon recommends that negative POC antigen tests be considered presumptive. Clinical staff in nursing homes should consider when confirmatory RT-PCR testing might be needed prior to making clinical decisions, cohorting residents, or excluding HCP from work. When interpreting the results of antigen tests, test characteristics and probability of infection should be considered.\n\nTest sensitivity might vary between antigen testing platforms. Facilities should be aware of which platform is being used and the sensitivity of the test for the patient population to be tested. For example, the first two antigen tests that have received FDA EUAsexternal icon range in sensitivity from 84% to 97% when used within 5 days of symptom onset.\nFactors that increase the probability of infection include the presence of symptoms in the person being tested, recent exposure to someone diagnosed with COVID-19, and whether testing is being conducted in a nursing home with an outbreak or within a high-prevalence community. These factors inform the decision of whether confirmatory testing by RT-PCR is indicated following an antigen test.\nIf a confirmatory RT-PCR test is performed within 48 hours, individuals should be assumed infectious until the confirmatory test results are completed. For instance, if a symptomatic resident tests presumptive negative on antigen test and a RT-PCR is performed, the resident should remain in Transmission-Based Precautions until the RT-PCR test results. If an asymptomatic HCP working in a nursing home without an outbreak and in a county with low community prevalence tests antigen positive, they should be excluded from work until a negative RT-PCR test is available.\n\nReporting requirements for SARS-CoV-2 tests\nEvery COVID-19 testing site is required to report to the appropriate state or local public health department every diagnostic and screening test performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 or to diagnose a possible case of COVID-19. POC testing may be performed with a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)external icon certificate of waiver, but reporting of test results to state or local public health departments are mandated by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.\n\nUses of antigen testing in nursing homes\nThis document guides the interpretation of results when antigen tests are used in the following circumstances:\n\nTesting of symptomatic residents and HCP,\nTesting of asymptomatic residents and HCP in facilities as part of an COVID-19 outbreak response, and\nTesting of asymptomatic HCP in facilities without a COVID-19 outbreak as required by CMS recommendations.\nTesting in other circumstances are likely to occur, such as testing asymptomatic residents and HCP who were exposed to persons with COVID-19 outside of the nursing home (e.g., recent hospitalization or outpatient services) or through other screening activities. The principles described here can be used to guide the interpretation of antigen test results in those situations.\n\nAntigen tests should not be utilized to determine the duration of Transmission-Based Precautions nor when HCP can return to work. Test-based strategies are not generally recommended to determine duration of transmission-based precautions, nor to determine when HCP may return to work. If used, test-based strategies should rely only on RT-PCR.\n\nConsiderations for interpreting antigen test results in nursing homes\n Testing of symptomatic residents or HCP\n\nIf an antigen test is positive, no confirmatory test is necessary.\nResidents should be placed in Transmission-Based Precautions or HCP should be excluded from work.\nIf the resident or HCP is the first positive test for SARS-CoV-2 within the facility (i.e., an index case), an outbreak response should be initiated immediately.*\nIf an antigen test is presumptive negative, perform RT-PCR immediately (e.g., within 48 hours).\nSymptomatic residents and HCP should be kept in transmission-based precautions or excluded from work until RT-PCR results return.\nSome antigen platforms have higher sensitivity when testing individuals within 5 days of symptom onset. Clinical discretion should be utilized to determine if individuals who test negative on such platforms should be retested with RT-PCR.\nNote: if an individual has recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection in the past 3 months and develops new symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, alternative diagnoses should be considered prior to retesting for SARS-CoV-2.\nTesting of asymptomatic residents or HCP in nursing homes as part of an outbreak response*\n\nIf an antigen test is positive, no confirmatory test is necessary.\nResidents should be placed in transmission-based precautions, and HCP should be excluded from work.\nIf an antigen test is presumptive negative, residents should be placed in appropriate precautions for facilities with an outbreak. HCP should be allowed to continue to work with continued symptom monitoring.  The facility should continue serial viral testing (antigen or RT-PCR) every 3-7 days until no new cases are identified for a 14-day period.\nNote: asymptomatic individuals who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection in the past 3 months and live or work in a nursing home performing facility-wide testing should not be tested for SARS-CoV-2.\nTesting of asymptomatic HCP in nursing homes without an outbreak per CMS recommendations\n\nCMS recommendsexternal icon initial testing of all HCP as part of the nursing home reopening process and serial testing of HCP at an interval based on local incidence of COVID-19.\n\nIf an antigen test is positive, perform confirmatory RT-PCR test within 48 hours of the antigen test, especially in counties with low prevalence. If confirmatory test is performed, HCP should be excluded from work until confirmatory test results are completed.\nIf the confirmatory test is positive, then exclude the HCP from work and initiate an outbreak response including facility-wide testing of all residents and HCP.\nIf the confirmatory test is negative, discuss results with the local public health department to determine how to interpret the discordant results and next steps. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the local community can help interpret the likelihood of a false positive antigen test. The time between antigen test and RT-PCR test should also be considered. If RT-PCR is performed >48 hours after an antigen test, it is possible that the viral dynamics have changed during the time between antigen and RT-PCR and testing.  Therefore, the antigen test may indicate a true infection even if the RT-PCR is negative.\nIf an antigen test is presumptive negative, allow HCP to continue to work. The HCP should continue to monitor for symptoms, and serial testing should continue per CMS recommendationsexternal icon.\nNote: HCP who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection in the past 3 months and are asymptomatic should not be tested for SARS-CoV-2.\nNotes:\n\n*A COVID-19 outbreak response in a nursing home is triggered when a resident or HCP tests positive for SARS-CoV-2. An index infection in a resident should include SARS-CoV-2 infections that originated in the nursing home and should not include:\n\nResidents who were known to have COVID-19 on admission to the facility and were placed into Transmission-Based Precautions.\nResidents who were placed into Transmission-Based Precautions on admission and developed SARS-CoV-2 infection within the 14-day period after admission.",

            "Text": "The scientists who designed the Research and Development Survey (RANDS) could never have foreseen the current global pandemic. But when COVID-19 struck, they recognized the tool was uniquely ready to meet the needs of the response.\n\nRANDS was developed at CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which is home to our nation\u2019s most comprehensive and longest-running health surveys. But unlike many of NCHS\u2019 other surveys, RANDS wasn\u2019t intended to collect data itself. Rather, it was designed primarily to conduct research about survey methods.\n\nThe team has now begun using RANDS to produce data about access to healthcare, use of telemedicine, and loss of work due to illness from COVID-19.\n\n\u201cFor the first time,\u201d says Jennifer Parker, who leads NCHS\u2019 research and methodology group. \u201cRANDS will be producing data that can be used to better understand a public health problem.\u201d\n\nBetter answers lead to better outcomes\nRANDS can be used to collect information about how people answering survey questions understand them, which lets researchers find ways to improve the quality of statistics they collect.\n\n\u201cThe first step to getting reliable survey data is to make sure you\u2019re asking good questions,\u201d Jennifer says. RANDS can tell researchers \u201cif the questions they\u2019re asking mean the same thing from person to person and from survey to survey.\u201d\n\nBecause the team had spent the past five years on this project, they were able to rapidly shift that knowledge toward the COVID-19 response. RANDS offered an advantage because it could easily be adapted to cover topics that are relevant to the pandemic, Behavioral Scientist Paul Scanlon says.\n\n\u201cWhen our usual surveys were suddenly interrupted by the pandemic, we realized that in RANDS we had created a platform that could quickly fill gaps in the data,\u201d Paul says.\n\nAsking questions about questions\n\u201cA useful feature of RANDS during the pandemic is that it can help us test the validity of new questions,\u201d he adds. \u201cResponding to COVID-19 requires that we ask questions we\u2019ve never asked before. When we introduce new concepts, like quarantine, we need to understand how people think about that. RANDS is a tool, alongside cognitive interviewing, for examining how people understand and respond to questions so we can improve on them.\u201d\n\nAs a behavioral scientist, Paul usually conducts one-on-one interviews to find out how people interpret specific survey questions. \u201cWhen I interview people, there are no right or wrong answers. It\u2019s just, \u2018What do you think a question means?\u2019 \u201cFor example, if a survey question says, \u2018How is your health?\u2019 we want to understand what factors people used to come up with an answer,\u201d he says. \u201cWere they thinking about their diet and exercise habits? Or whether they\u2019re sick or in pain right now? We don\u2019t know unless we ask follow-up questions that dig deeper.\u201d\n\nWithin RANDS are a series of unique questions, known as \u201cweb probes,\u201d designed to get at this kind of information. The probes are closed-ended, multiple choice questions that ask what respondents were thinking about as they answered the other survey questions.\n\n\u201cIf we can use RANDS to understand which questions work best, we can include them later in the year when we go back to conducting our longer-term surveys,\u201d Paul says.\n\nGetting it fast, getting it right\nAnother benefit RANDS brings to the response is the way it is delivered online. In addition to testing individual questions, RANDS has also been testing the uses of web panels recruited by research companies for gathering statistics.\n\n\u201cWeb panels are not something we typically use,\u201d says Katherine Irimata, the team\u2019s mathematical statistician who evaluates new ways to collect data. \u201cFrom a statistical perspective, online surveys present some very specific challenges we need to understand before we can incorporate them into our work.\u201d\n\nFor example, the panels used for RANDS are recruited by outside vendors, and it\u2019s important that they are selected using a reliable statistical framework. Also, response rates are lower for web surveys than NCHS\u2019 usual surveys, and the format itself may have an impact on who responds or how people interpret the questions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a good position to evaluate how these issues affect the results,\u201d says Katherine. \u201cNCHS already has decades of data from the National Health Interview Survey, and we\u2019ve been able to use that to help evaluate the data from RANDS. In turn, we\u2019ve been able to use the RANDS data to inform the questions on our existing surveys.\u201d\n\nShe notes, \u201cBecause we already had the web panels in place, and because RANDS has helped us understand so much more about how these data can be used, we were able to deploy quickly in the pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe innovative science behind RANDS will open doors for better data in the future. Web surveys can reach a lot of people quickly and have the potential to be a flexible, cost-effective addition to NCHS\u2019 arsenal, especially in an emergency response.\n\n\u201cWhen we built RANDS, we knew we could leverage the strength of our national survey data to evaluate, and possibly improve, health estimates from recruited panels,\u201d Jennifer says. \u201cOur idea is that this method can help not only NCHS, but eventually all federal statistical agencies.\u201d\n\nPaul adds, \u201cWe\u2019re just beginning to explore what RANDS can do.\u201d",

            "Text": "Existing heat illness prevention programs and policies can be tailored to the unique challenges of working during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHeat stress is the total amount of heat the body encounters. It may come from a variety of indoor or outdoor sources such as:\n\nHeat from work processes and machinery (e.g., forge)\nEnvironmental temperatures, humidity, and lack of air movement (e.g., no wind or inadequate air circulation)\nInternal metabolic processes (e.g., illnesses that create fever)\nHeat generated by muscles from physical exertion\nRisk Factors for Heat-related Illnesses\n\nMany risk factors can increase a worker\u2019s risk for a heat-related illness. Risk factors may be related to the work environment or characteristics of the individual worker or their current health status.\n\nExamples of heat-related illness risk factors include:\n\nHigh temperature and humidity\nDirect sun exposure\nIndoor radiant heat sources (e.g., machinery)\nLimited air movement\nNot drinking enough fluids to maintain hydration\nPhysical exertion\nPPE and clothing (i.e., these may trap heat close to the body)\nPhysical condition (e.g., obesity) and health problems\nCertain medications\nPregnancy\nLack of acclimatization (i.e., not being used to the heat)\nAdvanced age\nHaving had a previous heat-related illness\nHeat-related Illnesses\n\nHeat stroke, the most severe form of heat-related illness is a life-threatening medical emergency. As part of your heat illness prevention program, ensure that all staff is trained to recognize early signs of heat-related illness and understand the need to get prompt medical treatment to prevent heat stroke deaths.\n\nEarly signs of heat stroke may include:\n\nConfusion\nDifficulty performing routine tasks or answering simple questions (e.g., \u201cWhat is today\u2019s date?\u201d \u201cWhere are we?\u201d)\nSlurred speech\nLate signs of heat stroke may include:\n\nSeizures\nLoss of consciousness\nOrgan failure resulting in death When are employees at additional risk for heat-related illness during the COVID-19 Pandemic?\nImplementing the COVID-19 safety and health recommendations, such as those identified in the Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers, may alter an employee\u2019s working environment. These alterations can affect the risk level for heat-related illness due to:\n\nLoss of the body\u2019s natural adaptation to heat (acclimatization). This can occur if your workplace has closed temporarily or employees have been off work for more than one week.\nLack of a re-acclimatization component of work re-entry plan. This is important to have in place if employees have been out of the work environment for a week or more.\nIncreased heat burden associated with personal protective equipment (PPE) (for healthcare personnel) or cloth face coverings or masks. These can:\nReduce the body\u2019s normal ways of getting rid of heat by sweating and other means.\nIncrease effort required to breathe (through face covering or mask, or respirator (for healthcare personnel).\nElevate perception of anxiety brought on during wear.\nIncreased physical activity if employees have to do more than their usual job tasks due to social distancing requirements.\nIncreased time in a hot environment if employees are assigned longer shifts to catch up on work slowed down by shutdowns or other pandemic-related setbacks.\nHow can employers modify their heat illness prevention programs to protect workers from exposures to both heat stress and the virus causing COVID-19?\nPre-screen employees\nReassess employees\u2019 medical conditions to determine if they are still safe to work in an environment with additional heat stress risk from\nCOVID-19 related engineering controls,\nPPE (for healthcare personnel),\nCloth face covering or mask use, and\nSocial distancing practices.\nRe-acclimatization\nPlace employees returning after an absence of one or more weeks on a re-entry work schedule that will slowly reintroduce them to working in a hot environment. Employees can often re-acclimatize in 2 to 3 days upon return to work. NOTE: Workers new to the job may take up to 14 days to fully acclimatize.\nBuddy system\nAssign buddies and remind them to assess each other for symptoms of heat-related illness. Verbal check-ins are important because social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings or masks, or respirators (for healthcare personnel) make it harder to see signs and symptoms.\nIf the work process allows for it, maintain social distancing during any check-ins.\nCloth face coverings or masks and PPE (e.g., for healthcare personnel)\nProvide workers with cloth face coverings or masks and any required PPE that provide proper protection but minimize heat stress. Some considerations include:\nCloth face coverings or masks that are lightweight and light in color.\nProtective garments (if worn) made of breathable materials that are also lightweight and light in color.\nDamp or dirty cloth face coverings or masks need to be replaced with clean ones.\nIf use of cloth face coverings or masks may increase the risk of heat-related illness, consult with an occupational safety and health professional to determine the appropriate cloth face covering or mask for the setting. Outdoor workers may prioritize use of cloth face coverings or masks when in close contact with other people (e.g., during group travel or shift meetings) and remove them when social distancing is possible. CDC provides information on adaptations and alternatives that should be considered when cloth face coverings or masks may not be feasible.\nConsider allowing workers to remove cloth face coverings or masks outdoors if work positions or seating arrangements provide more than 6 feet between employees.\nIf storing the cloth face covering or mask while at work, employees should place the used cloth face covering or mask into a dry, breathable container or paper bag labeled with the employee\u2019s name.\nWork/rest schedules\nConsider altering the current work/rest schedule to account for the additional heat stress.\nDecrease the amount of work and increase the length and frequency of rest breaks. Frequent and longer rest breaks may be needed so that workers have adequate time to remove cloth face coverings or masks, practice proper hand washing, and rehydrate while maintaining social distancing requirements.\nSchedules will also need to be adjusted with increasing temperatures and humidity.\nEnsure managers who oversee work/rest schedules and manage cooling stations are trained to recognize heat-related illnesses and actively monitor employees for these conditions.\nIf possible, modify schedules so that the majority of work hours or the most physically demanding tasks occur overnight or during cooler parts of the day.\nDaily work completion targets\nReassess daily production targets if social distancing requirements or increased rest schedules add time to an employee\u2019s tasks. Consider decreasing the number of tasks to be completed on each shift.\nMake sure the facility is well ventilatedexternal icon.\nWork with facilities management to adjust the ventilation to deliver the maximum amount of fresh air to occupied spaces while maintaining the humidity at 40-60%. If possible, increase the filter efficiency of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) units to highest functional level.\nIncrease circulation of outdoor air as much as possible in non-climate-controlled indoor workspaces by opening windows and doors and using fans when environmental conditions and building requirements allow. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk for occupants. This will increase evaporative cooling effects for workers and will help dilute any respiratory droplets produced by workers.\nIf fans such as pedestal fans or hard mounted fans are used at the worksite, take steps to minimize air from fans blowing from one worker directly at another.\nCooling stations\nEnsure that cooling stations provide shading from the sun. Position cooling or misting fans and arrange seating so that air does not blow respiratory droplets from one employee to another seated nearby.\nArrange seating in the cooling station to maintain social distancing during rest breaks. Proper social distancing is very important during breaks as workers will need to remove respirators or cloth face coverings or masks to rehydrate.\nIf providing pre-packaged water bottles or rehydration fluids (such as sports drinks), place individual bottles at each seat before employees enter the cooling station at the start of each rest cycle to avoid congregating around water refill stations.\nAt each worksite, ensure that water is always easily accessible so employees can rehydrate frequently and as needed.\nIf water refill stations are unavoidable:\nUse markers and signs to promote social distancing in the refill line.\nConsider issuing refillable drinking bottles to employees or allowing them to bring their own to be stored inside the cooling station if they cannot or do not plan to carry them while working. Refillable bottles should be clearly marked with the employee\u2019s name and designated work/rest cycle.\nIf using disposable paper cones or cups, store them in an enclosed container near the refill station to reduce the risk of contamination if someone coughs or sneezes.\nAvoid contact between the water dispenser and a drinking cup or bottle when refilling it.\nIf cooling stations are located indoors, consider using no-touch activation methods for water dispensing.\nEmergency first aid plan for heat related illnesses\nImmediately remove worker from hot environment to cooling station.\nRemove PPE (normally worn for job tasks), cloth face covering or mask, and excess clothing from affected employee to facilitate cooling.\nProvide cool liquids to drink, if the employee is alert.\nIf heat stroke is suspected:\nCall 911.\nRemove all PPE from affected employee to facilitate emergent cooling and resuscitation measures.\nWhile waiting for the ambulance to arrive, cool the employee aggressively with any means available such as immersion in cool water or an ice bath or use of misting fans. Note that use of any immersion cooling methods in someone with heat stroke with a depressed mental status should include careful positioning and constant monitoring to prevent submersion and aspiration of cooling fluids.\nOther employees providing first aid or resuscitation should continue wearing their PPE (e.g., healthcare personnel) or cloth face coverings or masks.",

Stagger times to use the break room and enter and exit the building.\nLimit the time that you are close to others, to the extent possible (e.g., shorten appointment times, limit gatherings inside the salon, discourage clients from bringing additional people to appointments).\nWear a cloth mask in public and at work, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Cloth masks may prevent people who don\u2019t know they have the virus from spreading it to others. Cloth masks are intended to protect other people\u2014not the wearer. The spread of COVID-19 can be reduced when cloth masks are used along with other preventive measures, including social distancing. A universal face covering policy can be effective in preventing the transmission of the virus in close-contact interactions, including within a salon.\n\nBe careful when putting on and taking off cloth masks:\nDon\u2019t touch the cloth mask while wearing it.\nDon\u2019t touch your face, mouth, nose, or eyes while taking off the cloth mask.\nWash your hands before putting on and after taking off the cloth mask.\nWash the cloth mask after each use.\nConsider carrying a spare cloth mask. If the cloth mask becomes wet, visibly soiled, or contaminated at work, it should be removed and stored to be laundered later.\nCloth masks should not be worn if their use creates a new risk (for example, interferes with driving or vision, or contributes to heat-related illness) that exceeds their COVID-19 related benefits of slowing the spread of the virus. Cloth masks should also not be worn by children under the age of 2, anyone who has trouble breathing or is unable to remove the mask without assistance. CDC provides information on adaptations and alternatives that should be considered when cloth masks may not be feasible (e.g., people who are deaf or hard of hearing, have intellectual or developmental disabilities, or sensory sensitivities).\nIf you are concerned about the use of cloth masks at your workplace, discuss your concerns with your employer.\nEncourage clients over the age of 2 to wear cloth masks.\nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.\n\nContinue to follow applicable state regulations for health and public safety in addition to these recommendations.\nClean and disinfect the following items between each client:\nStyling chairs, hair washing sinks, massage tables, credit card devices, keypads, and other items that clients routinely touch.\nConsider using reusable chair covers. They should be laundered or cleaned and disinfected after each client.\nAll non-porous multi-use tools, such as shears, clippers, nippers, brushes, combs, etc.\nClean and disinfect the following areas or items on a routine basis or at least daily:\nCountertops, doorknobs, toilets (including handles), tables, light switches, phones, faucets, bathroom sinks, keyboards, etc.\nUse single use tools and supplies (e.g., salon capes) where possible.\nLaunder reusable fabric supplies after each use.\nFollow the directions on the cleaning and disinfecting products\u2019 labels, paying particular attention to proper dilution and contact times.\nWash your hands with soap and water afterwards.\nWash your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You don\u2019t need to wear gloves if you wash your hands regularly (unless they are already required for your job).\n\nUse an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol if soap and water aren\u2019t available.\nWash your hands at these key times:\nBefore, during, and after preparing food\nBefore eating food\nAfter using the toilet\nAfter blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing\nAfter putting on, touching, or removing cloth masks\nBefore and after work and work breaks\nBefore and after each client\nAfter cleaning and disinfecting\nDo not touch your face, mouth, nose, or eyes.\n\nCover your coughs and sneezes.\n\nUse tissues to cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze.\nThrow used tissues in the trash.\nWash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\n\nHow to Cope with Stress\nMental health is an important part of worker safety and health. The COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges in the ways many people work and connect with others, which may raise feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression.\n\nInformation and resources about mental health, knowing signs of stress, taking steps to manage stress, and knowing where to go if you need help are available here.\n\nHow Your Employer Can Protect You\nYour employer or the salon owner should develop a COVID-19 response plan and share it with you.

            "Text": "Jakarta, Indonesia - Medical experts have linked a surge in coronavirus cases on Bali to the inaccurate, low-cost rapid antibody test kits that are being used to screen domestic visitors to the Indonesian resort island.\n\nForeign tourists were banned from entering Indonesia on April 2, and while a plan to reopen Bali to international travellers this week has been dropped, domestic air travel resumed on July 31.\n\nSince then, the island has been welcoming an average of 3,000 domestic tourists every day, mostly from the neighbouring island of Java, the country's most densely populated province, and also the worst-hit by the pandemic.\n\nThroughout July and the first half of August, the number of new confirmed cases in Bali fell as low as 27 cases per day on August 10, with a seven-day average of 40 new cases per day.\n\nBut two weeks after the resumption of domestic travel, confirmed cases on the island began spiking, with five record-breaking days peaking at 198 new cases on September 4. As of Tuesday, Bali had 6,385 confirmed cases and 116 deaths. Across the country, the total number of cases was 196,989, with 8,130 deaths.\n\nMisinterpreting results\nIn order to enter Bali, visitors are required to present a negative rapid antibody test result that is no more than 14 days old.\n\nThey must also show no outward symptoms of the virus, such as a dry cough or fever, but Dr Dicky Budiman, an epidemiologist who has helped formulate Indonesia's pandemic response for 20 years, says the screening protocol probably allowed more cases to enter Bali.\n\n\"Rapid antibody test kits do not detect current infections. They only detect if a person has been infected within a few weeks or months ago,\" he said.\n\nHe also pointed out that the tests are \"not specific\" to COVID-19. \"If you test positive, you could have caught a different coronavirus from your dog. For this reason, Australia, England and India all stopped using them, because they are not accurate.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization in Indonesia has said the use of antibody tests gives travellers with non-reactive results a \"false sense of security\" as the tests' sensitivity to COVID-19 varies between 34 percent and 80 percent.\n\nThe Association of Indonesia's Clinical Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Specialists puts the accuracy of these tests at lower than 50 percent.\n\nBudiman says the best way to prevent domestic tourists with COVID-19 from spreading the virus in Bali is to change the screening protocol to a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test - the 'gold standard' used to screen Indonesian citizens and permanent residents returning from overseas. It's a view shared by Udayana University Professor Gusti Ngurah Mahardika, Bali's most senior virologist.\n\n\"I have said since February that rapid antibody tests are not suitable to screen people coming to Bali. It is a cheap solution suitable for screening patients in the hospital, and if the patient is reactive they need to have a PCR test to confirm if they're infected,\" he said. A reaction to the test means the person has antibodies to a virus, but if someone does not react to the test it does not mean they do not have the virus.\n\n\"They are interpreting the results the wrong way around,\" Mahardika added. \"Those with nonreactive results should have to have PCR tests on the spot or be quarantined.\"\n\nBad policy\nAhmad Utomo, a Jakarta-based independent molecular biological consultant specialising in the diagnosis of lung infections, agreed that the results of rapid antibody tests were being misinterpreted in Indonesia.\n\n\"If a person is reactive, they are building their antibodies and I would feel safer around them than those whose test results are inactive,\" he said.\n\nUtomo also said that testing for COVID-19 with rapid antibody tests is bad policy.\n\n\"They are generally not used for screening. They are an epidemiological tool used to study the burden of disease in specific areas. I don't know why they insist on them.\"But he is also sceptical about whether the surge in confirmed cases in Bali is related to the tests. He thinks the jump is more a reflection of people failing to follow guidelines designed to curb the virus's spread. Indonesia: Chinese vaccine to be tested as COVID-19 cases rise\n\"Just like East Java where cases are surging, it's probably about the behaviour of the masses,\" he said.\n\n\"People are holding public demonstrations, refusing any kind of tests, refusing to wear masks and not practising physical distancing because they don't believe the disease is real. And it's not entirely their fault.\n\n\"About 80 percent of cases in Indonesia are asymptomatic. Of the remaining 20 percent, only about half are in intensive care and the public do not see them. It's not like people are dropping dead on the street.\"\n\nPutting the economy first\nThe authorities in Indonesia have not explained why - given the concerns about reliability - the rapid antibody tests continue to be used as a travel requirement. The Bali Provincial Government, Bali Disaster Mitigation Agency and health department referred enquiries to the Bali COVID-19 Task Force, which in turn referred enquiries back to the health department.\n\nThe National COVID-19 Task Force and National Disaster Management Agency in Jakarta did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera's queries.\n\nOn Monday, Bali announced that as part of its effort to contain the pandemic, it would start imposing fines of 100,000 rupiah ($6.77) on residents seen out without a face mask. Budiman, the epidemiology expert, believes the government made the decision because \"they already bought millions of rapid antibody tests from China and want to use the stock\".\n\nBut others say the use of the tests is linked to the need to get the economy moving.\n\nWriting in the academic website, The Conversation, University of Melbourne Indonesia experts Tim Mann and Tim Lindsey said the government was concerned that the struggling economy \"could lead to more criticism of its handling of the crisis - and possibly social unrest\". The economic impact has been especially felt in Bali, where estimates show at least half, and perhaps as much as 80 percent of gross domestic product is linked to tourism.\n\nOn September 1, President Joko Widodo acknowledged the Indonesian province with \"the biggest economic contraction is Bali,\" with negative growth of 11 percent.\n\nAllowing domestic tourists to return to Bali is supposed to provide a much-needed economic lifeline for the island.\n\nThe antibody test costs about $10 per person.\n\nBut the PCR tests cost between $83 and $179, making them prohibitively expensive for many of the middle-class Indonesians who make up most of the country's domestic tourism market.\n\n\"If everyone had to take PCR tests, the cost for a family could be $1,000,\" a hotel executive in Bali told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity.",

            "HeadLine": "Race for coronavirus vaccine looms over presidential campaigns",
            "Text": "The prospect of a vaccine to shield Americans from coronavirus infection emerged as a point of contention in the White House race as President Donald Trump accused Democrats of \"disparaging\" for political gain a vaccine he repeatedly has said could be available before the election. \n\n\"It's so dangerous for our country, what they say, but the vaccine will be very safe and very effective,\" the president pledged Monday at a White House news conference. \n\nTrump levelled the accusation a day after Senator Kamala Harris, the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate, said she \"would not trust his word\" on getting the vaccine. \"I would trust the word of public health experts and scientists, but not Donald Trump,\" Harris said. \n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden amplified Harris's comments Monday after he was asked if he would get a vaccine for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Biden said he would take a vaccine, but wants to see what the scientists have to say, too. Biden said Trump has said \"so many things that aren't true, I'm worried if we do have a really good vaccine, people are going to be reluctant to take it. So he's undermining public confidence.\"\n\nStill, the former vice president said, \"If I could get a vaccine tomorrow I'd do it, if it would cost me the election I'd do it. We need a vaccine and we need it now.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth over a coronavirus vaccine played out as three of the candidates fanned out across the country on Labor Day, the traditional start of the two-month sprint to the election. Harris and Vice President Mike Pence campaigned in Wisconsin and Biden went to Pennsylvania. Trump added the news conference to a schedule that originally was blank.\n\n'They'll say anything'\nHarris, a California Democrat, said in a CNN interview broadcast Sunday that she would not trust a coronavirus vaccine if one were ready at the end of the year because \"there's very little that we can trust that ... comes out of Donald Trump's mouth.\" She argued that scientists would be \"muzzled\" because Trump is focused on getting re-elected.\n\nTrump dismissed her comments as \"reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric\" designed to detract from the effort to quickly ready a vaccine for a disease that has killed about 190,000 Americans and infected more than six million others, according to a count by Johns Hopkins University.\n\n\"She's talking about disparaging a vaccine so that people don't think the achievement was a great achievement,\" Trump said, answering reporters' questions as he stood at a lectern placed at the front door of the White House on the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the mansion. \"They'll say anything,\" he said. Trump insisted he has not said a vaccine could be ready before November, although he has said so repeatedly and as recently as Friday.\n\nThe president then proceeded to say what he had just denied ever saying.\n\n\"What I said is by the end of the year, but I think it could even be sooner than that,\" he said about a vaccine. \"It could be during the month of October, actually could be before November.\"\n\nUnder a programme Trump calls \"Operation Warp Speed\", the goal is to have 300 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine in stock by January. He has spent hundreds of billions of dollars on what amounts to a huge gamble since vaccine development usually takes years.\n\nVaccine politics Concerns exist about political influence over the development of a vaccine, and whether one produced through this process will be safe and effective.\n\nDr Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious-disease expert and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, told CNN last week that it is unlikely but \"not impossible\" that a vaccine could win approval in October, instead of November or December.\n\nFauci added that he's \"pretty sure\" a vaccine would not be approved for Americans unless it was both safe and effective. \n\nStephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, has said the agency would not cut corners as it evaluates vaccines, but would aim to expedite its work. He told the Financial Times last week that it might be \"appropriate\" to approve a vaccine before clinical trials were complete if the benefits outweighed the risks. COVID-19 vaccine: Safety concerns as countries rush for cure (2:24)\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, meanwhile, has given assurances that Trump \"will not in any way sacrifice safety\" when it comes to a vaccine. And executives of five top pharmaceutical companies pledged that no COVID-19 vaccines or treatments will be approved, even for emergency use, without proof they are safe and effective. Some concerns were sparked by a letter dated August 27 in which Dr Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, asked governors to help government contractor McKesson Corp make sure vaccine distribution facilities are up and running by November 1. \n\nRedfield did not say a vaccine would be ready by then. \n\nThree COVID-19 vaccines are undergoing final-stage, or phase three, clinical trials in the US. Each study is enrolling about 30,000 people who will get two shots, three weeks apart, and then will be monitored for coronavirus infections and side effects for anywhere from a week to two years.",

            "HeadLine": "Can drugmakers deliver a COVID-19 vaccine before the US election?",
            "Text": "As questions mount over whether the United States will authorise a coronavirus vaccine ahead of the November elections, experts say there is a slim chance that enough evidence will be available to prove one is safe and effective in that timeframe.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has repeatedly said a vaccine is possible before the November 3 election, and accused a \"deep state\" within the nation's top health regulator of trying to slow pivotal clinical trials to hamper his chances at a second term.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration denied that claim, saying its decisions will be guided by data alone. Drugmakers, seeking to bolster public confidence amid political squabbles on Tuesday pledged to uphold scientific safety and efficacy standards in their quest for a vaccine.\n\nVaccine safety was in focus on Wednesday after AstraZeneca PLC said it had put a pause on its coronavirus trial of the vaccine with Oxford to review the safety data of an unexplained illness in the United Kingdom trial. It described the move as routine and said it would restart trials when an independent committee recommended it do so.\n\nOther companies have recently made comments suggesting they could have an answer on whether their vaccines work before November. \"It would really be an amazing vaccine to show that,\" Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the Reuters news agency.\n\n\nFauci said initial trial results are likely to become available in November or December, but late October remains a possibility. \"It is conceivable that if there are enough infections documented early on that you might get that answer earlier,\" he said.\n\nVaccines must demonstrate they are at least 50 percent more effective than a placebo to be considered for approval. To prove that, government officials have said, at least 150 COVID-19 infections must be recorded among trial participants with at least twice as many occurring among the placebo group.\n\nIf a vaccine is especially effective, companies could have their answer sooner. Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc, whose US vaccine trials have enrolled thousands of people and are the most advanced, say they may have proof after just a few dozen subjects become infected.\n\nIndependent panels of experts called data and safety monitoring boards (DSMB) will review trial data at pre-specified points. These boards can recommend companies stop the trials if the evidence is overwhelmingly positive or negative.\n\nFor Pfizer, the first interim look occurs when 32 trial volunteers get infected.\n\nExperts interviewed by Reuters cautioned that information gleaned from a limited number of subjects could miss important safety issues that letting the trial fully play out might reveal.\n\n'Absolutely insufficient' Pfizer's trial calls for four interim analyses by the DSMB, the first after just 32 recorded infections. \"We may have enough data to be able to share the first analysis by October,\" said Pfizer spokeswoman Jerica Pitts. Moderna's first interim analysis will come after 53 trial subjects become infected, the company told investors last month.\n\nBasing a decision on 53 cases, is \"an absolutely insufficient number,\" said Dr Gregory Poland, a vaccine researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester who has served on FDA vaccine advisory panels. \"You would know very little about safety.\"\n\nTo halt the trials due to positive results, vaccines would likely have to exceed the 50 percent efficacy threshold.\n\nPfizer has not disclosed what standard will be used for stopping its trial early. William Gruber, head of vaccine clinical research and development for Pfizer, said: \"The standard would be evidence of very high efficacy.\"  A senior official with the US effort to accelerate COVID-19 vaccine development said companies have created appropriate trials to hold interim analyses that could detect especially effective vaccines earlier.\n\nSpeedy enrollment Although both drugmakers began vaccinating people in their respective 30,000-subject trials on July 28, Pfizer is in position to generate results earlier in part because it is administering the second shot of its two-dose vaccine a week earlier than Moderna. Moderna also slowed enrollment to ensure greater participation of at-risk minorities in its study.\n\nPfizer's trial also begins collecting data on infections that occur a week after it administers its second shot. Moderna has a two-week lag between the second shot and when it will begin collecting infection data in earnest.\n\nBoth trials are on pace to be fully enrolled soon.\n\nDr Henry Miller, a senior fellow at the Pacific Research Institute think-tank and former director of the FDA's office of biotechnology, said an emergency use authorization based on a small number of infections would not deliver an adequate answer on the safety of a vaccine intended for use by millions of healthy people. Some side effects could take four to six months to occur, he said.\n\nDr Gregory Glenn, research chief for Novavax Inc, which is also developing a coronavirus vaccine, said the October timeline remains possible. But he believes Americans will likely be waiting longer.\n\n\"I just think humility is a good thing right now,\" he said. \"The FDA set out some pretty strict criteria for success. So that's going to take a pretty good vaccine to do that.\"",

            "Text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness (see list of symptoms) caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2.\n\nHere is what we currently know:\n\nThe main way the virus spreads is from person to person through respiratory droplets when people cough, sneeze, or talk.\nYou may also be able to get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.\nThe virus may be spread by people who are not experiencing symptoms.\nCOVID-19 can sometimes cause serious complications. People at increased risk for severe illness include:\n\nOlder adults\nPeople of any age who have underlying medical conditions\nAs an offshore oil and gas employer, your workforce might come into contact with the virus when:\n\nIn close contact (within less than 6 feet) at the worksite with other people, which can include rig workers, engineers, technicians, managers, maintenance, galley staff, and housekeeping staff.\nTouching or handling frequently touched surfaces and equipment, and then touching their mouth, nose, or eyes. How You Can Protect Your Staff and Others and Slow the Spread\nEvaluate your workplace to identify scenarios where workers cannot maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet from each other and visitors. Use appropriate combinations of controls following the hierarchy of controls to address these situations to limit the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. A committee of workers and management may be most effective at recognizing all scenarios.\n\nWhile protecting workers, it is important to note that control recommendations or interventions to reduce risk of COVID-19 must be compatible with any safety programs and personal protective equipment (PPE) normally required for the job task. Approaches to consider may include the following: \n\nCreate and implement a COVID-19 Workplace Health and Safety Plan\n\nReview the CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers and the Resuming Business Toolkit for guidelines and recommendations that all employers can use to protect their employees.\n\nIdentify an on-site workplace coordinator who will be responsible for COVID-19 assessment and control.\nWhen developing plans, include all employees in the workplace, for example: staff, utility employees, relief employees, janitorial staff, maintenance, supervisory staff, rig workers, engineers, technicians, managers, maintenance, galley staff, and housekeeping staff.\nIdentify areas that may lead to close contact among employees, including work areas, break rooms, mess and galley areas, locker rooms, living quarters, and transportation vessels, such as helicopters.\nIf contractors enter the workspace, develop plans to communicate with them regarding modification to work or service processes.\nNotify all workers that any COVID-19 concerns should be directed to the identified coordinator.\nConsider standing up a virtual incident command system capable of providing telemedicine consultation, assisting with the management of suspected COVID-19 cases, and coordinating the evacuation of suspected cases to an appropriate onshore medical facility for testing or treatment.\nMaintain a daily log of approved visitors. This log should include the date and time the visitor entered and exited the offshore facility as well as their contact information. Regular crew are not considered visitors.\nDetermine if some tasks can be done remotely to reduce the number of employees on the offshore facility.\nConsider reducing personnel on board (POB) to essential personnel only while ensuring workers get enough rest and recovery.\nImplement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices.\nDevelop policies that encourage sick employees to stay at home without fear of reprisals, and ensure employees are aware of these policies.\nIf contractors are employed in the workplace, develop plans to communicate with the contracting company regarding modifications to work processes.\nConsider conducting daily in-person or virtual health checks (e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening) of employees on scheduled workdays and visitors before arrival.\nScreening options could include having employees self-screen before arriving at work or having on-site screening by taking employees\u2019 temperatures and assessing other potential symptoms prior to beginning work. (see CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers)\nMake sure employees can maintain at least 6 feet of distance while waiting for screening if done on-site.\nMake employee health screenings as private as possible and maintain the confidentiality of each individual\u2019s medical status and history.\nTake action if an employee or visitor is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19\n\nImmediately separate employees or visitors who report with or develop symptoms at work from other employees and arrange for private transport home. These employees should self-isolate and contact their health care provider immediately.\nEstablish an isolation area on the facility that is separate from other personnel and managed by designated health and safety personnel for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases.\nField managers should coordinate medevac arrangements with clients and other offshore stakeholders to ensure helicopters and boats are available and equipped to safely transport ill personnel, if necessary.\nFacility medical personnel or an onshore advisor should notify appropriate authorities before non-emergency medevac begins.\nPerform enhanced cleaning and disinfection after anyone suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 has been in the workplace. Cleaning staff should clean and disinfect offices, bathrooms, common areas, and shared equipment used by the sick person, focusing especially on frequently touched surfaces or objects. If other workers do not have access to these areas or items, wait 24 hours (or as long as possible) before cleaning and disinfecting.\nEmployees who test positive for COVID-19 should immediately notify their employer of their results.\nSick employees should follow CDC recommended steps to self-isolate or seek care. Employees should not return to work until they meet the criteria to discontinue home isolation, in consultation with healthcare providers. \nDevelop hazard controls using the hierarchy of controls to prevent infection among workers. You may be able to include a combination of controls noted below. \n\nEngineering Controls (Isolate people from the hazards)\nAlter the workspace using engineering controls to prevent exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19.\nModify the alignment of workstations where feasible. For example, redesign workstations so workers are not facing each other.\nWhere possible, establish physical barriers between workers. This includes all areas of the facilities, including work areas, break rooms, the galley, locker rooms, and living quarters.\nInstall cleanable transparent shields or other barriers to physically separate employees where distancing is not an option.\nUse strip curtains, plastic barriers, or similar materials to create impermeable dividers or partitions.\nClose or limit access to common areas where employees are likely to gather and interact, such as break rooms and in entrance/exit areas.\nEncourage social distancing of at least 6 feet between employees in all areas of the facilities.\nConsider making foot traffic single direction in narrow or confined areas, such as aisles and stairwells, to encourage single-file movement at a 6-foot distance.\nUse visual cues such as floor decals, colored tape, and signs to remind workers to maintain distance of at least 6 feet from others, including at their workstation and in break areas.\nPlace handwashing stations or hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol in multiple locations throughout the workplace for workers and visitors.\nUse touch-free stations where possible.\nMake sure restrooms are well stocked with soap and paper towels.\nMake sure the workspace is well ventilatedexternal icon.\nWork with facilities management to adjust the ventilation so that the maximum amount of fresh air is delivered to occupied spaces while maintaining the humidity at 40-60%. If possible, increase filter efficiency of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) units to highest functional level.\nPortable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration units may be considered to remove contaminants in the air of poorly ventilated areas.\nAdditional considerations for improving the building ventilation system can be found in the CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers and COVID-19 Employer Information for Office Buildings.\nAdministrative Controls (Change the way people work)\nProvide training and other administrative policies to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\nAll workers should have a basic understanding of COVID-19, how the disease is spread, what the symptoms of the disease are, and what measures can be taken to prevent or minimize the transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19.\nTrainings should include the importance of social distancing (maintaining a distance of 6 feet or more when possible), wearing cloth face coverings or masks appropriately, covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands, cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces, not sharing personal items or tools/equipment unless absolutely necessary, and not touching their face, mouth, nose, or eyes.\nWorkers should be encouraged to go home or stay home if they feel sick. Ensure that sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance, and that employees are aware of and understand these policies.\nConduct health checks (e.g., screening for temperature and/or other symptoms) for all personnel and visitors before they check-in to board any marine vessels or helicopters (shorebases and heliports) to go offshore.\nConsider maintaining small groups of workers in teams (cohorting) to reduce the number of coworkers each person is exposed to.\nLimit mixing of cohort groups, if possible.\nConsider extending the duration of work shifts, for example from 21 to 28 days, on offshore facilities to reduce turnover and give workers sufficient time to self-quarantine when they are not working.\nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.\nIf surfaces are dirty, clean them using a detergent or soap and water before you disinfect them.\nUse products that are EPA-registeredexternal icon, diluted household bleach solutions, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, appropriate for surface disinfection.\nProvide cleaning materials and conduct targeted and more frequent cleaning of frequently touched surfaces (workstations, tools, equipment, galley tables and chairs, railings, countertops, doorknobs, toilets, tables, light switches, phones, faucets, sinks, keyboards, etc.).\nProvide employees adequate time and access to soap, clean water, and single use paper towels for handwashing.\nRemind employees to wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, they should use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.\nProvide hand sanitizer, tissues and no touch waste baskets at the cash registers and in the restrooms.\nLimit the number of people gathered at one time. (Consult state and local guidance if available.)\nStagger shifts, start times, break times, and mealtimes as feasible.\nConsider limiting employees\u2019 movements between floors to only essential work functions and limit staff entering employees\u2019 living quarters unless it is necessary.\nEliminate shared living quarters to the extent possible. If this is not possible, then workers should practice CDC recommended precautions for preventing the spread of COVID-19, and the employer should conduct targeted daily cleaning of these shared spaces.\nConsult CDC Guidance on Shared and Congregate Housing for special considerations for preventing COVID-19 in shared housing situations.\nRemind employees that people may be able to spread COVID-19 even if they do not show symptoms. Consider all close interactions (within 6 feet) with employees and others as a potential source of exposure.\nPost signs and reminders at entrances and in strategic places providing instruction on social distancing, hand hygiene, use of cloth face coverings or masks, and cough and sneeze etiquette. Signs should be accessible for people with disabilities (e.g., large print), easy to understand, and may include signs for non-English speakers, as needed.\nCommunication and training should be easy to understand, in preferred language(s) spoken or read by the employees and include accurate and timely information.\nEmphasize use of images (infographics) that account for language differences.\nTraining should be reinforced with signs (preferably infographics), placed in strategic locations. CDC has free, simple posters available to download and print, some of which are translated into different languages.\nUse cloth face coverings or masks as appropriate.\nCloth face coverings or masks are intended to protect other people around you\u2014not the wearer. They are not considered to be personal protective equipment.\nEmphasize that care must be taken when putting on and taking off cloth face coverings or masks to ensure that the worker or the cloth face covering or mask does not become contaminated.\nCloth face coverings or masks should be routinely laundered.\nDo not wear cloth face coverings or masks if their use creates a new risk (e.g., interferes with driving or vision, or contributes to heat-related illness) that exceeds their COVID-19 related benefits of slowing the spread of the virus. Cloth face coverings or masks should also not be worn by anyone who has trouble breathing or is unable to remove it without assistance. CDC provides information on adaptations and alternatives that should be considered when cloth face coverings or masks may not be feasible (e.g., people who are deaf or hard of hearing, have intellectual or developmental disabilities, or sensory sensitivities).\nConsider requiring visitors to the workplace (e.g., service personnel) to also wear cloth face coverings or masks.\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE)\nPPE is the last step in the hierarchy of controls because it is more difficult to use effectively than other measures. To be protective and not introduce an additional hazard, the use of PPE requires characterization of the environment, knowledge of the hazard, training, and consistent correct use. This is why special emphasis is given to administrative and engineering controls when addressing occupational hazards, including when applying guidance to slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.\nIn the current COVID-19 pandemic, use of PPE such as surgical masks or N95 respirators is being prioritized for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance, unless they were required for your job before the pandemic. Offshore oil and gas workers should continue to wear all PPE required for their normal jobs.\nHow You Can Help Your Staff and Others Cope with Stress\nMental health is an important component of worker safety and health. The COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges in the ways many people work and interact with others, which may lead to increased feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression.\n\nInformation and resources about mental health, recognizing signs of stress, taking steps to build resilience and manage stress, and knowing where to go if you, your staff, or others need help are available here.",

            "HeadLine": "A coronavirus vaccine by Election Day? Probably not. Here's why",
            "Text": "(CNN)The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is asking states to get ready to distribute a coronavirus vaccine by as early as next month. The CEO of Pfizer says he thinks it's possible his company will have enough data to ask the US Food and Drug Administration for authorization by October.\n\nAnd officials inside the FDA have told CNN that Trump has consistently pressed agencies to speed up their timeline for developing a vaccine so he can have a vaccine victory by Election Day.\nIs it really possible we could have a coronavirus vaccine by November?\nDoctors who are running the clinical trials would know best, and they don't think so. \"Do the simple math,\" said Dr. Larry Corey of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, who is leading the team coordinating the cl nes in the US.\n\"We designed the trial to get to 130, 140 endpoints seven months from starting the trial,\" Corey told CNN. \"The first one started in mid-July.\" \"Endpoints\" are coronavirus infections. What Corey is saying is that the trials are designed to go on until 140 or 150 people catch the coronavirus. The researchers would look to see if people who got the real vaccine were less likely to be among those infected. But if you add seven months to July, you get February. That doesn't mean it's impossible to have an answer before then. If one of the vaccines being tested is highly effective, and there is a high rate of infection among the people volunteering in the trials, it's possible many people who got placebo shots would get infected quickly. \"If you had a highly effective vaccine, maybe you'd find that five months from designing the trial,\" Corey said.\nBut if you add five months to July, you get December.\nThat still doesn't get us to October.\nAnd there are other obstacles. Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the Food and Drug Administration's Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, said most of the Phase 3 trials underway now aim to enroll 30,000 people each. That's because the people who designed the trials think it will take that many volunteers for them to see 140 or 150 infections.\nNone is fully enrolled yet, so it's already September and many, if not most, of the volunteers have yet to receive their first dose. The vaccines in advanced, Phase 3 trials all require two doses, given one month apart. So people who received their first dose in August could not be given a second dose until September. And those receiving vaccines this month won't get their second dose until October.\n\"Then you have to wait two weeks after the second dose to really have full immunity,\" Offit told CNN.\nA highly unlikely -- but not impossible -- timeline\nSo why is the administration talking about results in November, or even October?\n\"It's highly unlikely, but it is theoretically possible without doing anything nefarious,\" said Dr. Ann Falsey, a professor of medicine at the University of Rochester School of Medicine in New York, who is coordinating the clinical trial there for AstraZeneca's candidate coronavirus vaccine.\nFor instance, if the virus is spreading fast, that would make for a lot of data, very fast. \"Unfortunately, there may be a real hotspot and there may be a lot of activity,\" Falsey told CNN. And if one of the vaccines being tested is highly effective, it would quickly become clear. People in the placebo group will get infected at a much higher rate than people who got the real vaccine.\n\"So maybe you get to a definitive answer sooner than you thought you would,\" she said. \"That would be unlikely,\" she added.\nOffit agreed. The trials are not designed to detect symptomless or mild infections, Offit said. \"The clinical endpoint is severe disease,\" he said. That makes it even less likely the trials are going to produce a lot of surprise data ahead of schedule. And the FDA has already told companies a vaccine has to be at least 50% effective to be considered. That means it will have to lower the risk of death or severe disease by 50%.\nEven if volunteers are in a virus hotspot, Offit said, they will have been counseled to be careful. It is an ethical requirement of the trials to caution the volunteers about the risks of becoming infected. \"You are telling people to wear face masks and social distance,\" he said.\n\"You are not telling them to go to a maskless biker's convention in South Dakota. You want them to protect themselves.\"\nThe FDA can't move faster than the data\nNormally, the FDA takes a year to approve a vaccine after all the Phase 3 data is submitted, Offit said. An expedited process would take 10 months.\nIn the case of a pandemic, that process is accelerated, and Operation Warp Speed has been running other needed steps in parallel with the clinical trials, helping companies start manufacturing vaccines even before the trials are over and ordering syringes and other equipment now instead of waiting until the trials are finished, so the FDA could be ready to move much, much sooner. But the only way there would be enough data to move one of the vaccines in the queue for FDA emergency use authorization would be if one or more of the trials got a surprising amount of data very, very quickly.\nPfizer Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Albert Bourla thinks that could happen. He said the Phase 3 clinical trial of his company's Covid-19 vaccine has enrolled about 23,000 participants, and some are already getting the second dose of the vaccine.\nPfizer \"should be able to have enough events to say if the product works or not\" by the end of October, Bourla said Thursday in remarks to to the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations. The people making that decision are the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. That's an independent group of experts -- separate from the company making the vaccine, separate from the doctors running the clinical trials and separate from the federal government -- who get to peek at the data early.\n\"They are there to protect the safety and to define the accuracy of the vaccine,\" Corey said.\nIf they see a clear signal that the vaccine is unsafe, for instance -- if many people have severe reactions, or if people who get the vaccine are in fact more likely to get infected -- they can stop the trial. They can also stop the trial if they see the vaccine really is not protecting people -- if just as many people who get the real vaccine become infected as those getting a placebo. And they can stop the trial if it looks like the vaccine is working better than expected. That's why the CDC is asking states to be ready to distribute a vaccine in October or November, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told CBS This Morning.\n\"God forbid we get great data and it comes out of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board and the FDA finds that it meets their standards, and we aren't ready to distribute,\" Azar said. \"We need to be ready for all contingencies and that's why the CDC is doing this.\"\nCorey said he doubted anyone on the DSMB would feel any pressure to stop a trial and recommend a FDA review because of pressure -- either political pressure or just the pressure of trying to end a pandemic that has killed 185,000 Americans. \"It's not like they don't understand the responsibility. All of them know how to read,\" Corey said.\nFalsey doesn't think so, either.\n\"I don't think that the message is that we are going to look at the data in the middle of the trial and if it looks kind of good, we'll go with it,\" Falsey said. If a vaccine gets fast tracked, it will be because there is definitive evidence, she said.\nOffit agrees. He said he trusts the FDA and the approval \"The irony of this is you may, by the end of the year, have a safe vaccine. But you have an administration that hasn't garnered a lot of trust,\" he said.\n\"Maybe we will have a safe and effective vaccine but people still won't trust it because they don't trust the way the administration has handled science. That would be the ultimate irony.\"",

            "Text": "New York (CNN Business)I was walking through one of the empty newsrooms at CNN's New York City office the other day when I noticed a newspaper front page, like a dinosaur fossil frozen in time.\n\n\"WORLD TURNED UPSIDE DOWN,\" the NYPost front page said. Next to the Post there was another stack of newspapers, equally out of date, carrying the news that the coronavirus has been \"DECLARED A PANDEMIC.\"\nThose front pages were printed six months ago this week. It was around that time when most CNN staffers began to work from home. Newspapers stopped being delivered. Almost everything else changed, too. The front pages are a little bit like a clock that stopped ticking at the moment of the blast. A reminder of when, as the Post put it, the world turned upside down.\nI was grateful for the reminder. I was equally grateful on Tuesday, when, on a visit to my three-year-old's school\u2014my first time there since March\u2014one of the teachers handed me a bag filled with all the clothes and belongings we left there six months ago, when school suddenly turned into a Zoom session. It was another artifact from the pre-coronavirus past. I bet we're going to hear a lot about \"six months ago\" as we approach September 12 and 13\u2014six months since the slow-motion shutdowns sped up and much of American life went on pause. It's helpful to remember what those anxiety-ridden days and weeks were like\u2014to examine what's changed, what hasn't changed, and what should have changed since then.\nTravel back in time\nSix months ago Monday, President Trump contradicted his own health officials and downplayed the virus. Tucker Carlson drove to Mar-a-Lago and tried to talk sense into him about the crisis, but didn't seem to succeed. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar tried to explain away Trump's bogus claim that anyone who needs a test can get a test. Jeanine Pirro aired an interview with Vice President Mike Pence that began with a softball question about governors making \"rude comments\" about lack of testing, as if manners are what mattered most at the time.\nSix months ago Tuesday, I showed a graphic on CNN that depicted a strange new concept called \"flattening the curve.\" News programs were filled with doctors warning about the growing dangers. Yet Trump was reportedly eager to hold more rallies. Peter Baker of The New York Times called coronavirus a \"leadership challenge he was not prepared for.\" NPR \"Weekend Edition\" co-host Lulu Garcia-Navarro asked on Twitter, \"Are we in the opening credits of the movie or halfway through before the nail biting ending?\"\nLooking back, we now know we were just in the opening credits. If you want to flash back in time six months, here's the Reliable Sources newsletter from March 8. It is discomfiting \u2014and maybe darkly amusing\u2014to read that edition now. I was asking questions that would be answered within a matter of days: Would movie premieres be delayed? Would Disney World close? Would TV guests join via video conferencing from home? Of course, of course, of course. The impacts would be beyond belief. And still are.\nTo me, at least, and maybe to you, the country adjusted slowly and then all at once. As Matt Pearce of the Los Angeles Times memorably said in early March, \"We are all coronavirus reporters now.\" And we still are. We can learn a lot by looking back and comparing March's coverage to the present. It is revealing to see which media outlets and political leaders have mostly moved past Covid-19, and which are still taking it very seriously, which leads to this next point...\nSix months ago Wednesday\nThis is what POTUS tweeted on March 9: \"So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!\"\nYes, do think about that.\nOn Tuesday evening Trump held a campaign event in North Carolina, all but pretended like the crisis has passed, and evidently violated the state's mask order, as CNN's Kevin Liptak reported.",

            "Text": "(CNN)When a coronavirus vaccine comes on the market, people will likely need two doses, not just one -- and that could cause real problems.\n\nSome of the potential problems are logistical. Difficulties procuring test kits and protective gear throughout the pandemic point to supply chain issues that could also plague distributing double doses of vaccines for an entire country.\nOther potential concerns are more human. Convincing people to show up to get a vaccine not once, but twice, could be a formidable undertaking.\n\"There's no question that this is going to be the most complicated, largest vaccination program in human history, and that's going to take a level of effort, a level of sophistication, that we've never tried before,\" said Dr. Kelly Moore, a health policy professor at Vanderbilt University.\nA double dose for a one-two punch\nSo far, Operation Warp Speed, the federal government's effort to get a vaccine on the market, has given money to six pharmaceutical companies.\nTwo of those companies, Moderna and Pfizer, are now in Phase 3, large-scale clinical trials. The 30,000 volunteers in each of the trials are getting two doses, with Moderna spacing their shots out 28 days apart and Pfizer spacing theirs out by 21 days. AstraZeneca is expected to start Phase 3 trials this month. Their Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials used two doses given 28 days apart.\nNovavax also has yet to begin Phase 3 trials but used two doses in their earlier trials.\nIn Johnson & Johnson's upcoming Phase 3 trials, some participants will take one dose and others will take two doses. Sanofi hasn't made announcements about whether their vaccine will be in one or two doses.\nIt's not surprising that the coronavirus vaccine will likely need two doses. Many vaccines -- including childhood vaccines for chickenpox and Hepatitis A and an adult vaccine for shingles -- require two doses.\nSome require even more -- children get five doses of the DTaP vaccine, which protects them against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. There's also a precedent for developing mass vaccination programs on short notice. In the spring of 2009, when a new strain of flu emerged, a vaccine program vaccinated 161 million Americans within months, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThat means the upcoming coronavirus vaccine program will be difficult -- but not impossible -- to pull off.\n\"I have faith we can do it, but it is a big ask and we have to work with people to make it work,\" Moore said.\nLogistical issues\nFirst, making 660 million doses for 330 million Americans is a tough feat.\n\"We're looking at\u202fdouble shots. That's twice the amount,\" said\u202fNada Sanders, a professor of supply\u202fchain management at Northeastern University.\u202f \"Doubling is a huge supply chain issue.\"\u202f\nIt's not just producing the vaccines itself.\n\"You have to double everything in the supply chain,\" Sanders said. \"The syringes, can they\u202fdouble up? Can the vials double up? Can the stoppers double up? Can the needles double up?\u202fEverybody has to double up, and then they all have to get it in time at the various entities along the supply chain.\" Sanders says she's worried, given the history of the Covid-19 pandemic in the US thus far has been rife with logistical problems, including delays in getting tests out on the market, and difficulties supplying health care workers with protective gear.\nStarting even before the pandemic, there have been shortages of Shingrix, a vaccine for shingles.\n\"We're talking about such exactness, and we couldn't get PPE right, so I'm concerned,\" Sanders said. \"There are many weaknesses across this supply chain -- many. If we don't address this now, the probability of failure is very high.\"\nHuman issues\nIt looks like it's going to be tough to get a majority of Americans to show up just once for a vaccine, let alone twice.\nAccording to CNN poll conducted this month, 40% of Americans say they won't get the vaccine, even if it's free and easy to get. Even for people who do want the vaccine, it's still a bigger ask to get them to show up twice.\nPeople will have to remember to come in the second time. They might have to take time off work - twice. They may have to wait in long lines -- twice. And possibly experience unpleasant side effects, like fever -- twice.\u202f\nThere are ways to address these hurdles, such as mobile clinics to bring vaccines to people rather than the other way around. \"These are the sorts of things that I think we need to think about, to make sure that we can incentivize people to come back\u202fto make it as easy as possible for them to adhere to a two shot regimen,\" said\u202fDr.\u202fNelson Michael, director of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, who has been assigned to work with Operation Warp",

            "Text": "(CNN)Children can carry coronavirus in their noses and throats for weeks even if they don't show any symptoms, which might explain how the virus can spread silently, researchers in South Korea reported Friday.\n\n\"In this case series study, inapparent infections in children may have been associated with silent COVID-19 transmission in the community,\" the researchers wrote in a new study. \"Interestingly, this study aligns with adult data in which up to 40% of adults may remain asymptomatic in the face of infection,\" Dr. Roberta DeBiasi and Dr. Meghan Delaney, both of Children's National Hospital in Washington, DC, wrote in an accompanying editorial. Neither was involved in the research.\n\"In this study, the authors estimate that 85 infected children (93%) would have been missed using a testing strategy focused on testing of symptomatic patients alone,\" they wrote.\nThe study comes out at a time when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been criticized for changing its guidelines on asymptomatic testing, which the American Academy of Pediatrics called \"a dangerous step backward\" in a statement on Friday.\nIn the CDC's updated guidelines, some people without symptoms may not need to be tested, even if they've been in close contact with someone known to have the virus.\nThis newly released research adds more evidence as to why casting a wide net when it comes to contact tracing is a key strategy to mitigate viral spread.\n\"We know that children often show few or no symptoms of COVID-19. We also know they are not immune to this virus, and they can become very sick. Testing exposed individuals who may not yet show symptoms of COVID-19 is crucial to contact tracing, which helps identify and support other people who are at risk of infection,\" AAP President Dr. Sally Goza said in the statement.\nHard to diagnose\nThe study, published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics on Friday, included data on 91 asymptomatic, presymptomatic and symptomatic children diagnosed with Covid-19 between February 18 and March 31 at 22 centers throughout South Korea.\nAmong those patients, 20 of them -- or 22% -- did not show any obvious symptoms and remained asymptomatic throughout the study.\nAnother 18 children -- or 20% -- were presymptomatic, meaning they didn't look or feel sick at the time but eventually got symptoms later. In total, more than half of the children -- 71 kids or 78% -- did show symptoms, which included fever, cough, diarrhea, abdominal pain and loss of smell or taste, among other symptoms. The duration of the symptoms appeared to vary, ranging from one to 36 days.\n\"This suggests that even mild and moderately affected children remain symptomatic for long periods of time,\" DeBiasi and Delaney wrote in the editorial.\nThe data showed that only 8.5% of those patients with symptoms were diagnosed with Covid-19 at the time their symptoms began. Most -- 66.2% -- of the patients with symptoms had symptoms that were not recognized before they were diagnosed, and 25.4% developed symptoms after they were diagnosed.\n\"This highlights the concept that infected children may be more likely to go unnoticed either with or without symptoms and continue on with their usual activities, which may contribute to viral circulation within their community,\" DeBiasi and Delaney wrote.\nVirus remained in respiratory tract\nThe study found genetic material from the virus was detectable in the children for a mean of 17.6 days overall. Even in the children who had no symptoms, the virus was detectable for 14 days on average. It's also possible that the virus remained in the children even longer, the study said, because the date of initial infection wasn't identified. However, this doesn't necessarily mean the children were spreading virus, experts say.\nThe presence of the virus genetic material in swabs \"need not equate with transmission, particularly in people who do not have important symptoms such as cough and sneeze,\" Calum Semple, professor in child health and outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool who was not involved in the study, said in a written statement on Friday.\nIn addition, \"sensitive molecular detection methods may detect viable, infective virus but also nonviable or fragments of RNA with no capability for transmission,\" DeBiasi and Delaney wrote.\nMore research also is needed to determine whether similar findings would emerge among a larger group of children from other parts of the world. Still, the new study provides information that can be used by public health officials when considering the spread of the virus in schools, according to DeBiasi and Delaney.\n\"A surveillance strategy that tests only symptomatic children will fail to identify children who are silently shedding virus while moving about their community and schools,\" they wrote. \"In regions where use of face masks is not widely accepted or used by the general public, asymptomatic carriers may serve as an important reservoir that may facilitate silent spread through a community.\" he Friday statement from AAP's Goza reinforced the need for systematic, wide-ranging tracking.\n\"Without data and transparency, science and medical professionals are hampered -- and families are harmed -- as we lack information that helps us understand how easily this virus can be transmitted to others and how to stop it,\" she said.",

Thirty-five percent of patients surveyed by the agency said they still weren't back to their usual good health even two to three weeks after testing positive for the disease. The rest said they'd returned to their usual state of health five to 12 days after a positive test. Hedgecock first tested positive in April.

His team is looking to connect the symptoms, with data pointing to the virus not just affecting the lungs but the blood vessels that connect the whole body, the doctor said.\n\"We think that this long-term damage may in part be due to vascular damage, kind of a footprint that the virus leaves even when it's gone from the body,\" Li said.\nWith still so much medical professionals don't know about the virus and its impacts on the body, they can't say how or if patients like Hedgecock will recover completely.\n\"I think what is really humbling to those of us in medical research and clinical care is when we confront something we just don't know enough about,\" Li said. \"But we need to take it seriously, and we need to have the humility to recognize that were just starting to observe and collect the data right now.\"\nThe not knowing is terrifying, Hedgecock said, but she is confident long-haul coronavirus is going to leave a mark on the US.\n\"This is going to be a public health debacle that is going to last for decades to come,\" she said.",

            "HeadLine": "There's a legitimate way to end coronavirus vaccine trials early, Fauci says",
            "Text": "(Kaiser Health News)A COVID-19 vaccine could be available earlier than expected if ongoing clinical trials produce overwhelmingly positive results, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease official, in an interview Tuesday with KHN.\n\nAlthough two ongoing clinical trials of 30,000 volunteers are expected to conclude by the end of the year, Fauci said an independent board has the authority to end the trials weeks early if interim results are overwhelmingly positive or negative.\nThe Data and Safety Monitoring Board could say, \"'The data is so good right now that you can say it's safe and effective,'\" Fauci said. In that case, researchers would have \"a moral obligation\" to end the trial early and make the active vaccine available to everyone in the study, including those who had been given placebos \u2014 and accelerate the process to give the vaccine to millions. Fauci's comments come at a time of growing concern about whether political pressure from the Trump administration could influence federal regulators and scientists overseeing the nation's response to the novel coronavirus pandemic, and erode shaky public confidence in vaccines. Prominent vaccine experts have said they fear Trump is pushing for an early vaccine approval to help win reelection.\nFauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he trusts the independent members of the DSMB \u2014 who are not government employees \u2014 to hold vaccines to high standards without being politically influenced. Members of the board are typically experts in vaccine science and biostatistics who teach at major medical schools. \"If you are making a decision about the vaccine, you'd better be sure you have very good evidence that it is both safe and effective,\" Fauci said. \"I'm not concerned about political pressure.\"\nThe safety board periodically looks at data from a clinical trial to determine if it's ethical to continue enrolling volunteers, who are randomly assigned to receive either an experimental vaccine or a placebo shot. Neither the volunteers nor the health workers who vaccinate them know which shot they're receiving.\nManufacturers are now testing three COVID vaccines in large-scale U.S. trials. The first two studies \u2014 one led by Moderna and the National Institutes of Health and the other led by Pfizer and BioNTech \u2014 began in late July. Each study was designed to enroll 30,000 participants.\nCompany officials have said both trials have enrolled about half that total. AstraZeneca, which has been running large-scale clinical trials in Great Britain, Brazil and South Africa, launched another large-scale vaccine study this week in the U.S., involving 30,000 volunteers. Additional vaccine trials are expected to begin this month. In trials of this size, researchers will know if a vaccine is effective after as few as 150 to 175 infections, said Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a call with reporters Friday.\n\"It may be surprising, but the number of events that need to occur is relatively small,\" Redfield said.\nRight now, only the safety board has access to the trial data, said Paul Mango, deputy chief of staff for policy at the Department of Health and Human Services. As for when trial results will be available, \"we cannot determine if it will be the middle of October or December.\" Safety boards set \"stopping rules\" at the beginning of a study, making their criteria for ending a trial very clear, said Dr. Eric Topol, executive vice president for research at Scripps Research in San Diego and an expert on the use of data in medical research.\nAlthough the safety board can recommend stopping a trial, the ultimate decision to halt a study is made by the scientists running the trial, Topol said.\nA vaccine manufacturer could then apply to the Food and Drug Administration for an emergency use authorization, which can be granted quickly, or continue through the regular drug approval process, which requires more time and evidence. Safety monitors also can stop a trial because of safety concerns, \"if it looks like it's actually harming people in the vaccine arm, due to a lot of adverse events,\" Fauci said.\nFauci said people can trust the process, because all the data that outside monitors used to make their decisions would be made public.\n\"All of that has to be transparent,\" Fauci said. \"The only time you get concerned is if there is any pressure to terminate the trial before you have enough data on safety and efficacy.\" Topol and other scientists have sharply criticized the FDA in recent weeks, accusing Commissioner Stephen Hahn of bowing to political pressure from the Trump administration, which has pushed the agency to approve COVID treatments faster.\nStopping trials early poses a number of risks, such as making a vaccine look more effective than it really is, Topol said.\n\"If you stop something early, you can get an exaggerated benefit that isn't real,\" because less positive evidence only emerges later, Topol said.\nStopping the studies early also could prevent researchers from recruiting more minority volunteers. So far, only about 1 in 5 trial participants are Black or Hispanic. Given that Blacks and Hispanics have been hit harder than other groups by the pandemic, Topol said, it's important that they make up a larger part of vaccine trials.\nEnding vaccine trials early also carries safety risks, said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine developer who serves on an NIH advisory panel on COVID vaccines and treatments. A smaller, shorter trial could fail to detect important vaccine side effects, which could become apparent only after millions of people have been immunized, said Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\nResearchers will continue to follow vaccinated volunteers for a full year to look for long-term side effects, Redfield said. And Fauci acknowledged that cutting a trial short could undermine public confidence in COVID vaccines. One American in three is unwilling to get a COVID vaccine, according to a recent Gallup Poll.",

In perhaps the most striking instance, more than 1,000 people gathered on a White House lawn, few wearing masks and sitting close together, to hear President Donald Trump accept his party's nomination Thursday night.\nAnd in the United Kingdom, the behavior of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has come to exemplify a double standard in the public mind where ordinary people are expected to follow the rules while the elite can apparently break them with impunity. Dominic Cummings refused to apologize for driving the length of England with his wife and child during lockdown, while his wife was sick with suspected coronavirus. Despite the furor, Cummings did not resign and was not sacked.\nCummings refused to apologize for driving the length of England with his wife and child during lockdown, while his wife was sick with suspected coronavirus, and subsequently driving to a beauty spot. Despite the furor, Cummings did not resign and was not sacked. His activities were investigated by the police, but he faced no action. Such examples have a lasting impact on the public's willingness to abide by restrictions, said Susan Michie, a professor of health psychology at University College London (UCL). Michie is part of the behavioral advisory group for the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), which has been spearheading its coronavirus response. She is also part of a separate group of experts called Independent Sage.\n\"We know that trust and perceived fairness are both very important in terms of protecting adherence,\" said Michie. \"We also know from the data that's collected from weekly surveys that trust diminished significantly, as did adherence, after the Dominic Cummings affair. Trust is very difficult to build up again -- it's easy to lose, difficult to build up.\"\nThe decision by Johnson and his Cabinet to defend Cummings' actions only made things worse, Michie said.\nOther high-profile UK figures have also violated the rules. Scotland's chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, resigned in April and was given a formal police warning after twice breaking lockdown restrictions to visit her second home.\nProfessor Neil Ferguson, a leading epidemiologist who advised the UK government on its coronavirus response resigned from his government post in May after he broke lockdown rules by allowing his reported lover to visit his home.\nSuch actions by influential figures \"exacerbate a sense of disenfranchisement because it gives a message that it's one rule for us, as in the privileged, and one rule for them,\" said Linda Bauld, a professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh.\n\"So it's very, very damaging, it's a very unfortunate thing.\"\n'The most foolish thing'\nSports stars and members of the cultural elite have been caught flouting restrictions too.\nAuthor Neil Gaiman prompted outrage -- and a visit from local police -- when he blogged in May about traveling from New Zealand to his home on the remote Scottish island of Skye while travel restrictions were in place. In a later post, he said he hadn't been thinking clearly because of marital issues. \"I want to apologize to everyone on the island for creating such a fuss,\" he wrote. \"I also want to thank and apologize to the local police, who had better things to do than check up on me. I'm sure I've done sillier things in my life, but this is the most foolish thing I've done in quite a while.\"\nEngland cricketer Jofra Archer was excluded from a Test match against the West Indies after he breached the team's bio-secure protocols with an unauthorized visit to his home.\nAnd a number of English Premier League soccer players, as well as Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho, were revealed to have breached lockdown restrictions. England and Manchester City footballer Kyle Walker apologized for reportedly hosting a party with two sex workers, while Everton striker Moise Kean was reprimanded for attending a party.\nSuch examples all have an impact, Michie said, particularly on young men, who are less likely to be sticking by the rules. Michie said she had been urging the UK government -- so far to no avail -- to make greater use of soccer players, singers and actors as role models in its information campaign, in order to reach different groups in society.\n\"We know that the more that people identify with the source, the more likely they are to adhere to it,\" she said.\nPoorest hit hardest by pandemic\nThe inequalities put on display when the rich and powerful flout the rules only add to public discontent.\nCoronavirus has made Britain's society even more unequal than it already was, said Michie, with restrictions on access to outside space and job losses hitting the poorest hardest. \"To then compound it in terms of 'one rule for us and one rule for them' completely undermines the importance of collective responsibility,\" she said. \"Particularly for those in crowded housing, it's very upsetting ... when they then see that people who have a lot in the society want more, while those who have very little are not given more.\"\nProfessor Stephen Reicher, a behavioral scientist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, warned that too much media coverage of those breaking coronavirus rules in the UK -- among the general population more than politicians -- was a risk in itself.\n\"One of the most remarkable things about the pandemic is that the level of compliance has been very high,\" said Reicher, who is also a member of the UK government's scientific advisory panel on behavior and of an advisory group on Covid-19 in Scotland.\n\"If we put too much focus on violations, the danger is it's not just a misrepresentation but can undermine compliance by creating false norms, by saying to us 'if everyone else is going out, if everyone else if breaking the rules, why don't we?'\" he said.\nReicher also cautioned against a trend in blaming partying young people for rising coronavirus infection rates. Figures in fact showed their level of compliance had been high, despite lockdown often being more onerous for them.\nAnother danger lies in imposing strict lockdowns without providing sufficient material support for the poorest and most vulnerable members of society, he said.\n\"If you want people to comply, it's a motivational thing, to create a sense of 'we-ness,' we are all in it together. You have to support people and help people to do what, by and large, they want to do.\"\nWhy leadership counts\nSo what should leaders be doing? It's simple really -- leading by example.\n\"Effective leadership really depends on being seen as part of the group that the leader wants to lead. People need to have trust in that leadership. Anything that separates the leadership from the rest of group really undermines it,\" said Bauld.\n\"If leaders do things that are not leading by example then we lose trust in them and we are less likely to follow the rules.\"\nBauld highlighted politicians in Canada, Germany and most of Southeast Asia as having done well at abiding by their own guidelines.\nMany governments do appear to be succeeding in maintaining trust despite the unprecedented challenges thrown up by the pandemic. A Pew Research Center survey released Thursday revealed that the United States and United Kingdom were the only two countries of the 14 polled where a minority of people said the government had handled Covid-19 well.\nThis will be just as important in the months ahead, as students increasingly return to schools and winter threatens to usher in a second peak in coronavirus infections in the northern hemisphere.\nAll countries are relying on their populations adhering to the rules and changing their behaviors in order to protect the most vulnerable, said Bauld.\n\"If there's any reason not to comply, or you are given an excuse not to comply, then that undermines the whole public health effort.\"",

            "HeadLine": "Putin's vaccine meets opposition from frontline workers in Russia\nZAHRA ULLAH, CNN EXPANSION",
            "Text": "Moscow (CNN)Vladimir Putin announced the approval of Russia's Sputnik-V coronavirus vaccine on August 11 amid much fanfare, saying it works \"quite effectively\" in forming a stable immunity.\n\nHow would he know this? Because the Russian President revealed one of his daughters had already taken it.\nSpeaking on Russian state TV at the time, Putin said his daughter had a slightly higher temperature after each dose of the two-stage coronavirus vaccine, but that \"Now she feels well.\"\nRussian authorities have singled out teachers -- as well as doctors -- as key workers who will get access to the vaccine first, even before crucial phase 3 human trials have finished.\nBut that's not gone down well with some sections of these frontline workers who don't buy Putin's claims of the efficacy of the vaccine and are reluctant to be used as human guinea pigs.\nOn September 1, Russian classrooms reopened for the first time since March amid the Covid-19 pandemic -- the same day the country surpassed 1 million coronavirus cases. Teachers were meant to be among the first to benefit from Russia's new coronavirus vaccine, especially given the close contact with hundreds of children that they are exposed to on a daily basis. But CNN is learning that few -- if any -- have so far taken up the offer to be vaccinated. Developed by the Moscow-based Gamaleya Institute, the Sputnik-V vaccine was named after the surprise 1957 launch of the world's first satellite by the Soviet Union.\nRussia's claim of victory at being the first to approve a coronavirus vaccine in a worldwide pandemic was initially met with widespread concern and unanswered questions over its safety and effectiveness, and not just from outside the country.\nA Russian teachers' union, \"Uchitel,\" started an online petition calling on members to reject the vaccine outright on safety grounds, and expressing concern that vaccination -- currently voluntary -- should not be made mandatory unless clinical trials are complete. Reality can differ from promises\nYuri Varlamov, a teacher in Moscow and a member of the union, said he doesn't want to take the vaccine because he doesn't believe it is safe right now.\n\"Before the end of trials, they cannot make it mandatory. But I know that in some schools and state bodies, people are talking about mandatory status of this vaccine by the end of this year,\" Varlamov said.\nMarina Balouyeva, co-chairman of the \"Uchitel\" union, said a petition against compulsory vaccination for teachers was more of a precaution.\nBalouyeva said she is wary of Sputnik-V for several reasons. \"Firstly, it is generally known that the quality of domestic vaccines is worse than that of foreign ones,\" she said.\n\"Secondly, the vaccine was created at railway speed, which already raises concerns. It was created in haste.\"\nDespite promises from authorities that taking the vaccine will be voluntary, she said she fears things could go differently in reality, as often happens in Russian state institutions. Balouyeva said no complaints have yet been made to her union from teachers saying they are being forced to be vaccinated. However, previous experience indicates there have been such problems with other vaccines, she says.\nFor example, officially, the seasonal flu shot is not mandatory for Russian educational workers -- it is voluntary. But according to Balouyeva some schools require it from their employees without fail.\nWhether there will be sanctions on those unwilling to be vaccinated with Sputnik-V, depends on the headteacher. Most schools have a so-called \"incentive bonus\" -- a fund of money that the administration can distribute as they see fit. Some teachers could be deprived of this payment if they don't get the vaccine.\nBalouyeva is all too familiar with the consequences that follow if you go against the school administration.\nHaving successfully worked for 15 years as an English teacher at a correctional school for children with cerebral palsy in St. Petersburg, Balouyeva says she was fired last year for an \"unexplained absence\" for not working during a school holiday.\nIt happened shortly after she was publicly vocal about teachers' salaries being lower than figures published in official documents.\n\"Teachers are a very disenfranchised category, just like doctors,\" the former teacher said, adding that the temptation to test the vaccine on them is immense. \"It is both cheap and practical -- why not do it, from the point of view of the authorities?\"\nCNN was given access by local authorities to one of Moscow's top public schools, where some measures -- like testing and teachers in facemasks -- have been implemented.\nBut no one CNN spoke to at School 1363 said they had taken the vaccine, although theysay they will \"definitely\" do so soon. Deputy head Maria Zatolokina said: \"I think that every teacher understands how important it is to be safe and to create a safe environment for our students to be healthy. That's why I hope that we are responsible people, and we should [all] be vaccinated.\"\nPolitical pressure\nCritics such as Anastasia Vasilyeva, a Russian doctor turned prominent campaigner and ally of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, says the country's push for a vaccine comes amid political pressure from the Kremlin, which is keen to portray Russia as a global scientific force. Navalny is currently being treated in a Berlin hospital after a suspected poisoning attempt in Siberia last month.\n\"I think it's to show Russia is a big strong country, that Putin is a big strong president,\" Vasilyeva told CNN.\nHer colleague, a surgeon at a hospital in northeast Moscow, shared his concerns about the vaccine with CNN, strictly on the condition of anonymity, due to fear of facing repercussions at work, if he came out publicly against the vaccine. When offered the vaccine in early August, he started consulting with experts.\n\"I am not a vaccine specialist,\" he admits, \"So, I called the doctors who deal with vaccinations, I called immunologists. They said, 'don't do it, by no means, the vaccine is raw.'\"\nIt was a friendly offer, he says, no pressure, no obligations. But no matter how hard the deputy chief physician tried to persuade the surgeon that the vaccine is \"perfectly normal, good, amazing,\" the doctor still was reluctant to try it on himself.\n\"Explain to me: how could it be that such powerful European and international organizations could not do it, but a relatively small Gamaleya Institute could? I cannot understand it,\" the surgeon said.\nHe didn't know when the vaccine would be delivered to his hospital but said very few of his colleagues would have the courage to refuse it. \"Totalitarianism remains [in Russia]. The two most helpless sectors are education and health care. Everything is done forcefully here. Last year I had a flu shot, everyone was told they needed to be vaccinated. And everyone did it, because if you don't, there will be penalties.\"\nBut it isn't just doctors and teachers who voiced concerns Russia may have cut essential corners in development.\nPolls suggest around half of Russian citizens have doubts about the vaccine, the Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said on Friday during a video conference with Putin. He added, however, that two months ago, the figure was almost 90%.\nSobyanin, who revealed he had been vaccinated with Sputnik-V, was speaking just moments after Russia published its peer-reviewed data from phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials in The Lancet medical journal, which suggest the Russian vaccine has a good safety profile and produced no serious adverse side effects.\nScientists not involved in the study said while the results are a positive sign, only larger, Phase 3 trials can confirm whether the vaccine actually prevents illness with Covid-19.\nThe Russian defense minister was also shown getting the shot. It seems Russia's messaging about the vaccine has gone into full overdrive following the publication of its scientific data. It remains to be seen if the tide of public opinion and front-line workers will change over time too.",

The rates of illness continue to rise rapidly within many communities across the nation, and the potential exists for the pandemic to overburden health care resources in some localities,\" Obama said in a statement.\n\n\"Thus, in recognition of the continuing progression of the pandemic, and in further preparation as a nation, we are taking additional steps to facilitate our response.\"\n\nThe president signed the declaration late Friday and announced it Saturday.\n\nCalling the emergency declaration \"an important tool in our kit going forward,\" one administration official called Obama's action a \"proactive measure that's not in response to any new development.\" Having trouble finding vaccine? Share your story\n\nAnother administration official said the move is \"not tied to the current case count\" and \"gives the federal government more power to help states\" by lifting bureaucratic requirements -- both in treating patients and moving equipment to where it's most needed. The officials didn't want their names used because they were not authorized to speak on the record.\n\nObama's action allows Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius \"to temporarily waive or modify certain requirements\" to help health care facilities enact emergency plans to deal with the pandemic.\n\nThose requirements are contained in Medicare, Medicaid and state Children's Health Insurance programs, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act privacy rule.\n\nSince the H1N1 flu pandemic began in April, millions of people in the United States have been infected, at least 20,000 have been hospitalized and more than 1,000 have died, said Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nWatch how to find out if you have H1N1\n\nFrieden said that having 46 states reporting widespread flu transmission is traditionally the hallmark of the peak of flu season. To have the flu season peak at this time of the year is \"extremely unusual.\"\n\nThe CDC said 16.1 million doses of H1N1, or swine flu, vaccine had been made by Friday -- 2 million more than two days earlier. About 11.3 million of those had been distributed throughout the United States, Frieden said.\n\n\"We are nowhere near where we thought we would be,\" Frieden said, acknowledging that manufacturing delays have contributed to less vaccine being available than expected. \"As public health professionals, vaccination is our strongest tool. Not having enough is frustrating to all of us.\"\n\nFrieden said that while the way vaccine is manufactured is \"tried and true,\" it's not well-suited for ramping up production during a pandemic because it takes at least six months. The vaccine is produced by growing weakened virus in eggs.",

            "Text": "(CNN) -- The H1N1 virus has now become the dominant influenza virus around the globe, with high levels and an increase of activity in many regions, the World Health Organization said Thursday.\n\nIn a weekly update, the WHO's point person on the H1N1 virus, Dr. Keiji Fukuda, also warned the public not to treat the virus like just another flu.\n\nLike seasonal flu, H1N1 is more active in the winter than in the summer, and a majority of infected people get better on their own, Fukuda said. H1N1 also is as transmissible and infectious as seasonal flu, he said.\n\nBut unusually for influenza, Fukuda said, H1N1 continues at high levels over the summer months, and many of the serious illnesses and deaths are concentrated in people younger than 65.\n\nSeven months into the pandemic, the virus commonly known as swine flu remains at high levels and continues to increase in North America, Fukuda said. Mexico, for example, has seen more cases from September to November than they saw in the preceding months from April, when the virus emerged, he said.\n\nThe virus is also becoming more active in Europe and Central and Western Asia, Fukuda said.\n\nHealth officials this week reported an outbreak of cases in Ukraine, which now has more than 250,000 cases of influenza-like illness, with 235 patients requiring intensive care, the WHO said.\n\nActivity is picking up in East Asia, Fukuda said. Mongolia reported \"a number\" of cases over the past week, he said. \"East Asia is one of the parts of the world where seasonal influenza viruses have remained in reasonably high circulation,\" Fukuda said. \"But even in that part of the world, the pandemic virus is becoming dominant.\"\n\nMore cases are being reported from a number of Caribbean countries such as Cuba and Haiti, he said.\n\nIn Central America and the Southern Hemisphere, however, activity levels have dropped as those regions enter the summer season, Fukuda said.\n\n\"There are several regions in the world -- North America, Europe, Northern and Central Asia -- where we are clearly seeing pandemic influenza activity increase,\" he said, but \"there is no one single place in the world where we are focused on.\"\n\nDisease activity has been difficult to predict, Fukuda said.\n\n\"We really are not going to know what the future is going to bring, and so the main focus of our effort here is ... what steps are needed to make sure countries are as prepared as possible to deal with disease levels,\" he said.\n\nH1N1 poses different challenges in different countries, but it does seem to be affecting indigenous groups more heavily than nonindigenous groups, he said.\n\nIn Australia, for example, \"aboriginal groups are disproportionately represented in people who end up in hospitals from diseases related to the pandemic,\" Fukuda said.\n\nThe WHO still doesn't know whether the effect on indigenous groups is because of the pandemic itself or because of underlying factors.\n\nBecause most people infected with swine flu tend to recover on their own and don't suffer major problems afterwards, some people are tempted to dismiss the infection and think it's not serious. But Fukuda said that's a dangerous mind-set.\n\n\"At WHO, we remain quite concerned about the patterns we are seeing, particularly because a sizable number of people develop complications [that lead to death],\" he said. \"We do see that the serious complications are concentrated in the younger age groups rather than the older age groups.\"\n\nWhile the complications are most often seen in people who have chronic, underlying health conditions and in pregnant women, they also can develop in people \"who are currently healthy and young.\"\n\nBut contrary to some reports, Fukuda said, the WHO has not seen big mutations in the virus since it first emerged. He said viruses being isolated now are \"generally similar\" to those isolated over the past several months, indicating they haven't changed much.\n\nThe WHO also has no evidence of widespread resistance to antiviral medication, Fukuda said. There have been sporadic instances of resistance to oseltamivir -- the generic name for Tamiflu, one of the main drugs used against influenza -- but such cases are still \"isolated and infrequent,\" he said.\n\n\"Antivirals are quite useful against these infections,\" he said.\n\nFukuda praised as \"innovative\" the decision by Norway to distribute antiviral medication over the counter for a limited period of time. The move can help take stress off the primary health system and allow patients to get the medicine more quickly, he said.\n\nOther useful protections against H1N1 are vaccines, which the WHO recommends against pandemic infections, Fukuda said.\n\n\"These vaccines now have been used in a significant number of countries ... and based on this experience, in which millions of people have now received vaccine, we in fact see that these vaccines are very safe,\" he said.\n\nThe only side effects are swelling and pain at the injection site, but \"these are occurring at rates that are expected and usually seen with seasonal influenza vaccine,\" Fukuda said.\n\n\"WHO, along with other public health authorities, believes that these vaccines are very useful against pandemic infections and [we] do support their use,\" he said.",

But Dr. Anne Schuchat, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the estimate gives a \"more accurate picture\" of the scale of the pandemic.\n\nThe figure was based on a detailed analysis of data from several dozen districts around the country, she said. The method used to calculate the mortality figures is similar to that used to produce estimates of ordinary seasonal flu deaths, which are believed to number about 36,000 a year.\n\nAn estimated 22 million people in the United States have contracted the virus, commonly known as swine flu, resulting in about 98,000 hospitalizations through October 17, Schuchat said.\n\nAmong children under 18, about 8 million are believed to have been sickened, 36,000 have been hospitalized and 540 have died, a much higher number than the 129 laboratory-confirmed child deaths the CDC reported November 6.\n\nAbout 12 million adults up to age 64 had been reported ill, with 53,000 hospitalizations in that age group and 2,900 deaths. People over age 65 accounted for 2 million illnesses, 9,000 hospitalizations and 440 deaths, Schuchat said.\n\nThe prevalence of flu cases is higher than at any time since the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, she said, but the death rate is \"nowhere near the severity of the 1918 pandemic.\"\n\nSchuchat said 41.6 million doses of H1N1 vaccine are now available, up from 38 million last week, but \"not as much as we'd hoped to have by today.\" She told reporters last week that about 8 million new doses were expected this week.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has ordered 75 million doses of swine flu vaccine for delivery by year's end, and the CDC had predicted that 40 million doses would be available by the end of October.\n\nProduction delays have hampered agency plans, and the lag has led to criticism of the program. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Tuesday found Americans are starting to lose confidence in the government's ability to prevent a nationwide epidemic, though a narrow majority continue to say that the government and private industry will eventually produce enough of the vaccine to inoculate everyone who wants it.",

The report urges speedier production of the H1N1 vaccine and the availability of some doses by September.\n\nThe H1N1 virus, commonly known as swine flu virus, could infect between 30 percent and 50 percent of the American population during the fall and winter and lead to as many as 1.8 million U.S. hospital admissions, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology reported.\n\nThe report says 30,000 to 90,000 deaths are projected as part of a \"plausible scenario\" involving large outbreaks at schools, inadequate antiviral supplies and the virus peaking before vaccinations have time to be effective.\n\nUp to 40,000 U.S. deaths are linked to seasonal flu each year, with most of the fatalities occurring among people over 65. With seasonal flu and H1N1, this fall is expected to bring more influenza deaths and place \"enormous stress\" on intensive care units nationwide, which normally operate near capacity, the report says.\n\nAn H1N1 resurgence may happen as early as September, at the beginning of the school year, and infections may peak in mid-October, according to the report. However, the H1N1 vaccine isn't expected to be available until mid-October, and even then it will take several weeks for vaccinated individuals to develop immunity, the report says.

That decision would be hers, she said, and she emphasized that any vaccination program would be strictly voluntary.\n\nPregnant women, health care workers and parents or guardians of infants under 6 months of age are among the most vulnerable segments of the population, Sebelius has said.\n\nAdults under the age of 65 with an underlying health condition -- such as asthma -- are also considered to be more at risk from the H1N1 virus.\n\nH1N1 preparation guidelines for the nation's businesses and school systems were released three weeks ago. The plans are available at the Web site www.flu.gov.\n\nadvertisement\nThe H1N1 vaccine would require two shots, the second three weeks after the first.

In Egypt, the government ordered that all pigs be slaughtered -- although eating pork does not spread the virus.\n\nIn June, the World Health Organization raised the alert to its highest level, stating that the H1N1 virus had spread to enough countries to be considered a global pandemic.

Evidence also showed many of the seriously ill patients had underlying medical conditions.\n\nSince the pandemic began, 50 million in the United States have been infected. The CDC estimates about 200,000 hospitalizations and about 10,000 deaths from H1N1.\n\nA vaccine created this year, which public health authorities say is the best way to protect against H1N1, was made available to the public this fall.\n\nHealth care reform\n\nObama made health care reform a top priority on his domestic agenda and urged Congress to pass such a bill, sparking months of political wrangling.\n\nThe health care reform bill, if it passes into law, would be the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid. It would extend insurance coverage to an estimated 30 million additional Americans. Among other things, the House and Senate bills -- which still need to be reconciled -- require individuals to buy health insurance and limit insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions.\n\nAs the cost of health care skyrockets in America, supporters say reform would slow this economic burden. But critics voice concerns about the reform's impact on the existing health care system and its cost. Those anxieties flamed protests and contentious town hall meetings around the country.\n\nIn November, the House passed a $1 trillion health care reform bill that includes a public option, a government-funded, government-run health care plan. The $871 billion bill that the Senate passed does not include the public option.\n\nLiberal members of the Democratic Party said the Senate bill has been too watered down. Meanwhile, Republicans slammed both versions of the bill, saying it will raise taxes while doing little to slow spiraling health care costs; they have labeled it \"a monstrosity.\"\n\nA conference committee will convene to iron out the differences between the two versions in January.\n\nCancer screenings/mammograms\n\nThe medical establishment raised questions about certain cancer screening tests that for years people were told were a necessity.\n\nIn November, a government task force recommended that women in their 40s not get routine annual mammograms. It advised women between 40 and 50 to discuss with their doctor the benefits and harms of having a mammogram, since these tests could result in false positives, anxiety and unnecessary biopsies.\n\nThe change in the task force's guidelines triggered confusion, outrage and accusations of health care rationing. Cancer survivors and patient advocate groups said that routine mammograms save lives. A spokeswoman for the task force later said the guidelines had been communicated poorly to the public.\n\nFor men, a decade-long study found that prostate cancer screenings led to more diagnoses but did not reduce the number of deaths.\n\nSince the early 1990s, controversy around annual prostate screening has persisted in the medical community. Some doctors and medical organizations are skeptical of the screening, citing lack of scientific evidence that it saves lives and the risk of common treatment side effects, including impotence and incontinence. Doctors say that more research is required and that there's no definitive answer on prostate screenings yet.\n\nStem cell policy reversal\n\nObama signed an executive order this year repealing a Bush-era policy that limited federal dollars for human stem cell research, permitting the National Institutes of Health to conduct and fund studies on controversial embryonic stem cells.\n\nSome scientists believe embryonic stem cells could help treat many diseases and disabilities, because of their potential to develop into many different cell types in the body.\n\nWhile some advocates praised the executive order as a a giant step forward for medical research, conservatives groups objected, contending that the destruction of human embryos ends human life.\n\nPeanut butter scare\n\nSalmonella-tainted peanut butter paste -- found in crackers, cookies, ice cream and snack items -- sickened more than 600 people and killed nine in the United States. The outbreak, which came to light in January, was traced back to a processing plant in Blakely, Georgia, owned by Peanut Corp. of America. A second PCA-owned plant in Plainview, Texas, was later raided and shut down by state health officials for health violations.\n\nThe outbreak led to one of the largest food recalls in U.S. history, involving more than 1,000 products. A Food and Drug Administration report said Peanut Corp. of America shipped a tainted product it knew had tested positive for salmonella. The company filed for bankruptcy in February.\n\nThe outbreak renewed criticism about the lack of food safety oversight in the country.",

Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano briefs reporters at the White House Sunday.\nmore photos \u00bb\n\nKeiji Fukuda, the assistant director-general of the World Health Organization, called the outbreak \"serious\" on Sunday. Researchers are still trying to determine how easily the virus is transmitted person to person and it's too early to predict whether there will be a mild or serious pandemic, said Fukuda.\n\nDr. Alejandro Macias, an epidemiologist and adviser to the federal Ministry of Health, told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol that the official death toll was at 86. Macias said five more deaths in Mexico City had been reported to federal authorities by local authorities in the city.\n\nEarlier, Mexican President Felipe Calderon said 81 deaths were suspected to be from the outbreak and 374 people remained hospitalized. Another 929 people have been examined and sent home, he said.\n\n\"These people have shown up at some medical institution in the country with respiratory symptoms that required to be studied and diagnosed,\" he said.\n\nMexico City closed all of its schools and universities until further notice because of the virus, and troops passed out filter masks outside the National Cathedral on Sunday morning. No masses were scheduled at the cathedral, but dozens of worshippers put on masks and went inside the church to pray on their own.\n\nPublic Health Emergency\nAccording to the World Health Organization, a public health emergency is an occurence or imminent threat of illness or health conditions caused by bioterrorism, epidemic or pandemic disease, or highly fatal infectious agents or toxins that pose serious risk to a significant number of people.\n\nAt a White House news conference Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the emergency declaration is standard procedure -- citing that one was declared for the inauguration and for recent flooding.\nMexican Finance Minister Augustin Carstens said Sunday that the World Bank was lending Mexico $205 million to deal with the outbreak. \"We are getting an immediate loan of $25 million for the requisition of medicines, medical equipment and epidemiological equipment and in addition, $180 million to build up strategic operational and institutional capacities to deal with this issue,\" he said.\n\nRussia announced it is banning meat imports from Mexico and the southern United States due to the outbreak of swine flu, the Interfax news agency reported. Passengers arriving in Russia from Mexico and the United States also will be screened for swine flu, the news agency reported, by having their temperatures taken upon arrival.\n\nCanada confirmed six cases of mild illnesses on Sunday, and the United States reported 20. Meanwhile, Spain, Israel and New Zealand were investigating possible but unconfirmed cases.\n\nIn Washington, the head of the Centers for Disease Control said 20 cases had been confirmed in five U.S. states by noon Sunday. The largest number of cases was in New York, where the CDC confirmed cases in eight students at a preparatory school in that city, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Sunday.\n\nAnother seven cases have been confirmed in California, two each in Kansas and Texas and one in Ohio, said Dr. Richard Besser, the CDC's acting director. Only one person has had to be hospitalized, but Besser said authorities are likely to see \"a broader spectrum of disease\" in the days ahead.\n\n\"Given the reports out of Mexico, I would expect that over time we're going to see more severe disease in this country,\" he said.\n\nCanada's chief public health officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones said the symptoms seen there -- headaches, fevers, coughs and muscle aches -- were mild by the standards of serious flu cases. But he added, \"It's still pretty miserable.\"\n\nThe U.S. government declared a public health emergency -- a step Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said \"sounds more severe than really it is.\"\n\n\"This is standard operating procedure and allows us to free up federal state and local agencies and their resources for prevention and mitigation,\" she said.\n\nThe outbreak \"is of great concern to the White House,\" said White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, but, he added, \"It's certainly not a time to panic.\"\n\n\"If you're sick, stay home, get treatment, go see a doctor,\" Gibbs told reporters. \"The government is taking all the steps it needs to and must do to take the precautions to deal with whatever size and scope we may be facing,\" he said.

WHO official Gregory Hartl said the strain of the virus seen in Mexico is worrisome because it has mutated from older strains. iReport.com: Do you think we should be worried about swine flu?\n\n\"Any time that there is a virus which changes ... it means perhaps the immunities the human body has built up to dealing with influenza might not be adjusted well enough to dealing with this new virus,\" he said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Air Transport Association, which represents the U.S. airline industry, said the group is taking the matter seriously.\n\nHealth Library\nMayoClinic.com: Influenza (flu)\nAirport employees and flight crews are on the lookout for any passengers who show signs of illness, and procedures are in place for determining whether ill passengers may fly, Andrus said.\n\nAt Los Angeles International Airport, custodians have been instructed to pay additional attention to sanitizing door knobs, handrails and faucets in airport restrooms, according to a statement from Los Angeles World Airports.\n\n\"In addition, public education signs with general tips on preventing the spread of illnesses -- that are posted throughout the airport during regular flu season -- are being re-posted,\" the statement said.\n\nThe H1N1 strain of swine flu is usually associated with pigs. When the flu spreads person to person, instead of from animals to humans, it can continue to mutate, making it a tougher strain that is harder to treat or fight off. Symptoms of swine flu include fever, lethargy, lack of appetite, coughing, runny nose, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, the CDC said.

The group remains quarantined at home, and Health Minister Tony Ryall said 10 students tested positive for influenza A -- the general category of strains that includes the H1N1 swine flu.\n\nIn Spain, six people, all of whom had recently returned from Mexico, were being isolated in hospitals, the country's health ministry reported. And in Israel, doctors are running tests on a man who recently returned from Mexico with light flu symptoms.\n\nIn London, a hospital spokesman said a British Airways crew member developed flu-like symptoms during a flight from Mexico City and was tested for swine flu, but the results came back negative.

Video Watch efforts in Mexico to prevent spread of the virus \u00bb\n\nNeither Britain nor the United States have issued any travel warnings or quarantines. But South Korea said it will test airline passengers arriving from the United States, and Japan will convene a Cabinet meeting Monday to come up with measures to block the entry of the virus into the country.\n\nKatherine Andrus, an attorney for the U.S. Air Transport Association, told CNN that the airline trade association was in regular contact with the CDC.\n\nadvertisement\nAndrus said airlines are following their own procedures to watch for ill passengers and crews have standard procedures for dealing with ill passengers. Any onboard communicable disease incidents must be reported to the CDC, she said.\n\n\"This is a time for appropriate precautions but not panic,\" Andrus said.",

            "Text": "BETHESDA, Maryland (CNN) -- Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told government leaders at a swine flu preparedness summit Thursday that a vaccine to fight the H1N1 virus should be ready for distribution in mid-October. HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius tells a summit Thursday that the impact of the H1N1 virus may worsen in the fall.\n\nBut Sebelius also advised 500 government, health and education leaders to plan for the worst-case scenario of the virus reappearing with renewed strength this fall.\n\n\"What we need to assume is that it will come back in a much more severe form,\" she said at the conference at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, outside Washington.\n\nCommonly called swine flu, the virus is also known as influenza A(H1N1). The World Health Organization declared the virus a global pandemic last month.\n\nSebelius said that extensive planning to combat the spread of the virus always could be scaled back later but that officials could not delay starting work on those preparations.\n\n\"We can step back from our planning. What we can't do is wait until October,\" she said.\n\nThe fight against H1N1 will be federally funded, the secretary said. She said the government will announce $350 million in preparedness grants on Friday, with $260 million for state health departments and $90 million for hospitals preparing for a possible surge of patients. President Obama requested the summit, and he spoke to the group via video link from Italy, where he is attending the Group of Eight meeting of industrialized nations.\n\n\"We want to make sure we aren't promoting panic, but we are promoting vigilance and preparation,\" Obama said.\n\nObama urged state and local officials, including school districts, to prepare for a vaccination campaign in the fall and to anticipate that the virus could significantly affect schools.\n\nHealth care workers hope to evaluate a candidate vaccine against H1N1 in August, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who also spoke at the meeting.\n\nSebelius said medical experts are testing virus strains, preparing the production lines and beginning clinical trials.\n\nShe said the initial target group for the vaccine will be pregnant women, children ages 5 to 17, health care workers, the elderly and anyone with chronic health conditions such as asthma.\n\nA new Web site has been set up for H1N1, http://www.flu.gov/, which has information on the virus and helpful tips.\n\nA school nurse was one of three education workers invited to talk about their experiences in the spring during the wave of swine flu cases.\n\nMary Pappas of St. Francis Prep High School in Fresh Meadows, New York, said she was called on to take charge when students began showing up in her office with fevers.\n\nPappas said that she told the kids to pull out their cell phones and call their parents to come get them. That Thursday, she sent 102 students home; on Friday, another 80 sick students left school.\n\nAt one point, she said, there were so many sick teens that she asked a security guard to take their temperatures, write the number on a Post-it note and attach it to their chests.\n\nThe private school was closed during the following week.\n\nAccording to the New York City Health Department, at least 69 cases of the H1N1 virus were confirmed at the school, and the number likely increased after the agency stopped counting.\n\nA health department survey showed that one-third of the students, or 659 teens, reported flulike symptoms during April.\n\nBelinda Lee Pustka, a school superintendent in Schertz, Texas, a suburb of San Antonio, said parks and churches closed when the swine flu hit.\n\nParents wanted to know the impact of the virus on their family and community, said Pustka, who oversees the Schertz-Cibolo-Universal City Independent School District.\n\nGood communication was the key, she said. The district held daily news conferences and opened a Twitter account that some people used to ask questions during briefings.\n\n\"It was a very positive experience, but it was a very hard experience for the community,\" Pustka added.\n\nSwine flu continues to circulate in the United States and more than 120 other countries -- especially in the Southern Hemisphere, where flu season is under way. The virus could hit the U.S. as children return to school, which is only weeks away, Sebelius told CNN earlier Thursday.\n\nThursday's symposium offers an opportunity to look ahead and begin to put things in place, Sebelius said on CNN's \"American Morning.\"\n\nThere are more than 33,900 confirmed and probable cases of the H1N1 virus in the United States, with 170 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 98,000 cases have been documented worldwide, with 440 deaths, according to the WHO.\n\nThe virus has bucked traditional flu outbreak patterns. Influenza is typically more active during winter and then slows when the weather turns hot.\n\n\"Now, in the UK, as in many of the North American countries -- Canada, Mexico and the United States -- there has been quite widespread activity, or a lot of activity of this pandemic influenza virus. And right now, it is at a typical point of the year where the activity should be pretty low, but the activity is quite high because it is a pandemic situation for these countries,\" Keiji Fukuda, WHO assistant director-general, said this week.\n\nRegular seasonal flu kills about 36,000 Americans annually.

Kindergarten students, some wearing masks, attend school in a residential estate in Hong Kong on Thursday.\n\nIncreasing the alert to Phase 6 does not mean that the disease is deadlier or more dangerous than before, just that it has spread to more countries, the WHO said.\n\n\"This is an important and challenging day for all of us,\" WHO Director General Margaret Chan said in a briefing with reporters. \"We are moving into the early days of the first flu pandemic of the 21st century.\"\n\nThe last previous pandemic occurred in 1968.\n\nAs of Thursday, the virus had spread to 74 countries, the health agency said. There were 28,774 confirmed cases and 144 deaths.\n\nThe United States had 13,217 cases and 27 deaths, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said June 5 in its weekly update.

See where H1N1 flu cases are in the U.S. \u00bb\n\nThe U.S. death toll is expected be higher when the CDC releases its latest figures Friday, said Anne Schuchat, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. New England -- particularly Massachusetts -- and the New York and New Jersey areas have been hit the hardest, Schuchat said Thursday at a CDC news conference.\n\nThe Phase 6 pandemic designation had been widely expected for weeks.\n\n\"Further spread is considered inevitable,\" Chan said at a news conference at WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. \"The scientific criteria for an influenza pandemic have been met.\"\n\nThe announcement came after a meeting of the WHO's Emergency Committee, which has debated since April whether the spread of a novel H1N1 flu virus was fast and widespread enough to warrant a Phase 6 designation.\n\nPhase 6, Chan said, is meant as a signal to countries to recalibrate their strategies to minimize the harm from swine flu. In countries where the virus and the response to it are already widespread, it is not likely to mean significant changes, but Chan urged countries that have not seen cases, or seen only limited cases, to get ready.\n\n\"The virus is not stoppable,\" she said. \"I would advise them to maintain vigilance, enhance surveillance and be prepared for the arrival of the novel H1N1 in their country.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Homeland Security said those agencies have been acting for weeks as if Phase 6 were already in effect and no additional measures would be put into effect.\n\nThe United States declared a public health emergency April 26.\n\n\"WHO continues to recommend no restriction on travel and on border closures,\" Chan said.\n\nDiscussions about shifting to Phase 6 have been under way for weeks. Chan indicated that a major factor in the decision was surveillance from countries in the Southern Hemisphere, where flu season is under way. In Chile and Australia, two countries with many flu cases, she said H1N1 appears to be the dominant strain, \"crowding out\" the seasonal influenza virus.\n\nChan said she would recommend that vaccine manufacturers proceed with mass production of an inoculation against the new swine flu strain as soon as they finish production of seasonal vaccine, which she estimated would be complete in about two weeks.\n\nHHS spokesman Bill Hall said Thursday that no decision has been made on full-scale production because there is no need yet to make that decision.\n\nIt is a step-by-step process that is moving forward. \"We're doing as much as we can now,\" he said.\n\nThe agency awarded a contract several weeks ago to five manufacturers to develop an H1N1 antigen. The companies are producing pilot lots. Clinical testing will take place over the summer, Hall said.\n\nAt the end of the summer, HHS will decide whether to go into production.\n\n\"There's no specific date on the calendar,\" Hall said.\n\nIf officials decide to produce a vaccine, the first doses would be ready early in the fall. Hall noted that even full-scale production doesn't mean there will be an immunization campaign. Federal officials may have a vaccine and decide not to use it, he said.\n\nAlso Thursday, authorities in Hong Kong ordered the closure of all elementary schools, kindergartens and day care centers in the city after 12 students were found to be infected with the virus.\n\nAuthorities have not determined the source of the infection, said Hong Kong's Chief Executive Donald Tsang. This makes it the first cluster of swine flu cases in the city without a link to someone who had traveled overseas.\n\nThe schools and day care centers were told to close for 14 days as investigators tried to identify the source of the infection, said Tsang, the chief executive.\n\nThe health department will decide after two weeks whether to continue the shutdown.\n\nadvertisement\nAlso on Thursday, Israel's health ministry announced that the number of people diagnosed with swine flu there was 68.\n\nHealth officials use the virus' clinical name -- H1N1 -- to reflect that it's actually a combination of several different types of flu and to reduce confusion about whether eating pork can spread the virus. It cannot. CNN's David S. Martin, Roya Shadravan in Hong Kong, and Michal Zippori in Jerusalem contributed to this report.",

            "Text": "(CNN)Here's a look at the H1N1 influenza virus, also known as swine flu. There was a pandemic outbreak across the globe which lasted from 2009 to 2010. Swine Flu\nSwine flu is a respiratory disease caused by type A influenza virus in pigs. Swine flu outbreaks are common in pig herds, but generally the disease causes few deaths in pigs.\nSwine flu is transmitted between pigs through close contact and contact with contaminated objects. Flu spreads when someone touches an object coughed or sneezed on by an infected person and then touches his/her mouth or nose. However, swine flu cannot be passed from properly handled pork products to humans.\nSwine flu outbreaks in pigs can occur at any time, but mostly occur during the late fall and winter months.\nIt is a constantly mutating virus. Pigs are susceptible to viruses from birds, humans and other swine. When different influenza viruses strike pigs, the genes can mutate and new viruses can develop.\nIn pigs, there are currently three common influenza A virus subtypes in the United States: H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2.\nSwine Flu in Humans\nSwine flu occurs in people that are in contact with infected pigs. When this occurs, it is called a \"variant influenza virus.\"\nSymptoms are similar to that of regular human influenza and can include fever, lethargy, lack of appetite, coughing, runny nose, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.\nAntiviral drugs that treat variant flu infections in humans are oseltamivir (Tamiflu), zanamivir (Relenza) and peramivir (Rapivab).\nTimeline\n1930 - The swine flu virus (an influenza type A H1N1 virus) is first isolated from a pig.\n1976 - Swine flu (Hsw1N1) breaks out among soldiers at Fort Dix in New Jersey.

However, the program is suspended after people who received shots develop a rare illness called Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.\nSeptember 1988 - A woman dies of the H1N1 flu virus days after visiting a county fair pig exhibition where there was widespread influenza-like illness among the swine.\nDecember 2005-February 2009 - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports 12 cases of swine flu among humans.\nApril 2009 - Swine influenza A (H1N1) virus is detected in a 10-year-old boy.

            "Text": "(CNN) -- Last spring, U.S. doctors' offices were barraged with phone calls and worried patients packed into hospitals. Schools closed. Face masks and Tamiflu were suddenly in short supply. The country verged on an H1N1 panic.\n\nThe new flu virus, first widely reported in Mexico, was infecting the young and healthy, rather than those usually most at risk, the elderly and infirm. Beginning in April 2009, H1N1 flu fanned across the globe. The World Health Organization declared it a global pandemic in June.\n\nHand sanitizer was suddenly seen everywhere, and, heeding the often-repeated advice of top U.S. health officials, many people began coughing into their shoulders or elbows rather than covering their mouths with their hands.\n\n\"My patients were so anxious,\" recalled Dr. Danielle Ofri, an internist at Bellevue Hospital in New York. \"They were so agitated. They wanted to know about that swine flu vaccine and when they're going to get it.\n\n\"It was another variation of the flu. Yet for our patients, it seemed so different, so unusual, so scary -- that the emotions took off well out of proportion of the disease.\"\n\nThe toll, while devastating to the families of those who died of H1N1, has not matched early projections of as many as 90,000 flu-related fatalities in the U.S.\n\nH1N1 may have killed as many as 17,000 Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In an average year, about 36,000 people die from seasonal flu-related causes, according to the CDC.\n\nToday, the visible signs of fear have ebbed. Many vaccination clinics report low turnout and have cut back their hours, according to local news reports. A recent health poll by the Harvard School of Public Health reported that nearly half of those surveyed believed the outbreak was over.\n\nOn Tuesday, a committee of the World Health Organization is scheduled to convene to review the H1N1 situation and possibly begin the process of officially downgrading the pandemic.\n\nHowever, Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the special adviser on pandemic influenza to the director-general of the WHO, warned the change does not mean H1N1 is no longer a concern.\n\n\"The ending of a pandemic is not an on-and-off phenomenon,\" he said at a press briefing last week. \"We really expected it to be more of a tailing-off phenomenon.\"\n\nAlthough it seems that H1N1 has receded from the public consciousness, Fukuda said, \"It is expected that it will continue to be a significant virus, circulating around the world as we head into the winter or the coming winter in 2010 and 2011.\"\n\nLast week, the WHO recommended that the pandemic H1N1 influenza strain be included in the flu vaccine for the coming fall and winter. A Food and Drug Administration committee took similar steps Monday, which means there will not be a separate H1N1 vaccine this fall.\n\nPaging Dr. Gupta blog: 2009 H1N1 flu strain will be in next season flu vaccine\n\nAlthough some people may think that including H1N1 in the regular seasonal vaccine is a sign that it's a reduced threat, Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, said the risks should not be discounted.\n\n\"I don't think there is any reason to minimize what's yet ahead, just because it's in the seasonal flu vaccine.\n\n\"This virus does do damage differently than seasonal flu,\" Osterholm said. \"We're talking about a disease that causes severe disease and deaths in a much younger population where you don't expect to see that.\"\n\nPublic health agencies have been criticized for sounding alarmist about H1N1. But Ira Longini, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Washington School of Public Health and Community Medicine, said not much was known in the spring of 2009 when the virus began sickening and killing people.\n\n\"It is difficult when you're dealing with a potentially extremely dangerous virus,\" said Longini. \"You err on the side of caution. It could've been really bad -- it wasn't. It's much better than not reacting and having a public health disaster.\"\n\nInitially, H1N1 elicited an extraordinary response, described as an emotional epidemiology by Bellevue's Ofri, who is also an associate professor at the New York University School of Medicine and author of \"Medicine in Translation.\"\n\n\"The diseases themselves have their own epidemiology, related to biological environmental factors,\" she said. \"Our perception of illness runs its own independent course from the actual epidemiology of an illness. H1N1 is a perfect example.\"\n\nOne reason that the pandemic struck a chord was that it fit an \"outbreak narrative.\" These types of diseases often originate from developing countries and spread throughout the world.\n\n\"It feels like the world is being overtaken,\" she said. \"Ebola, HIV, SARS were examples of how the pattern of disease development fit this narrative arc and struck our emotion.\"\n\nNowadays, she said, her patients barely mention swine flu.\n\n\"Once this was out of headlines, once the drama of the narrative arc is gone, it's no longer this unknown, evil, dark illness,\" she said. \"Now it's kind of mundane, prosaic and so it doesn't make an interesting movie any longer. So it doesn't concern people anymore.\"\n\nThat's reflected in comments from Christopher Gower, an iReport contributor who lives in Henderson, Kentucky.\n\n\"I think it was overblown, \" he said of H1N1. \"They scared the public pretty bad.\"\n\nGower didn't get the vaccine, because he distrusts drug companies and fears side effects. He considered H1N1 just like a seasonal flu.\n\nWatch Gower's iReport submission.\n\nBut for Egberto Willies, H1N1 posed an imminent danger for his family.\n\nHis wife has lupus, an autoimmune disorder.\n\n\"It was extremely frightening,\" said Willies, who lives in Kingwood, Texas. \"I usually don't get scared but this hit home because you could see the reality of young people dying from getting something that looked like a cold. When it came to my wife, it was affecting people who are immunosuppressed. She was flying blind.\"\n\nWatch Willies' iReport submission His wife was able to get the vaccine early.\n\nAnd advances in public health enabled fast, effective response, said Longini, the biostatistician.\n\n\"Through surveillance and modern microbiology and disease control methods, we've learned, we're able to react quite quickly,\" he said. \"We know a lot, we're able to deal with threats if we're organized quite well.\"",

            "Text": "(CNN) -- As the number of swine flu cases rises around the world, so is a gradual backlash -- with some saying the threat the virus poses is overblown. Workers in South Korea, where one case of swine flu is confirmed, disinfect a terminal Sunday at Incheon airport.\n\nBy Monday, 985 cases of the virus, known as influenza A (H1N1), had been confirmed in 20 countries, the World Health Organization said. The number of fatalities was at 26, including one in the United States.\n\n\"There is too much hysteria in the country and so far, there hasn't been that great a danger,\" said Congressman Ron Paul, a Republican from Texas. \"It's overblown, grossly so.\"\n\nPaul, who was a freshman congressman during a swine flu outbreak in 1976, said Congress voted to inoculate the whole country at the time.\n\nTwenty-five people died from the inoculation while one person was killed by the flu, Paul said, adding that he voted against inoculation. Video Watch Ron Paul talk about 1976 swine flu \u00bb\n\nThe United States' only death this year from the virus was a 22-month-old boy in Texas who was visiting from Mexico. The other 25 deaths happened in Mexico.\n\n\"I wish people would back off a little bit,\" Paul said. Others shared Paul's sentiment, saying the fear of the flu has gotten out of hand.\n\n\"We have people without symptoms going into the emergency rooms asking to be screened for swine flu at the expense of people with real illness,\" said Cathy Gichema, a nurse in Pikesville, Maryland.\n\n\"Schools are being shut for probable causes -- sending these kids congregating to the malls. How is that helping?\" Gichema said.\n\nDr. Mark Bell, principal of Emergent Medical Associates, which operates 18 emergency departments in Southern California, said the level of fear is unprecedented.\n\n\"I haven't seen such a panic among communities perhaps ever,\" Bell said. \"Right now, people think if they have a cough or a cold, they're going to die. That's a scary, frightening place to be in. I wish that this hysteria had not occurred and that we had tempered a little bit of our opinions and thoughts and fears in the media.\"\n\nGovernments and health officials, however, say the concern is not unfounded.\n\nThe virus, a hybrid of swine, avian and human flu, can jump from person to person with relative ease. And while most of the cases were reported in Mexico and the United States, some have been confirmed in countries outside North America.\n\nOn Saturday, the virus strain was found in a herd of swine in Alberta, Canada, and the animals may have caught the flu from a farmer who recently returned from a trip to Mexico.\n\nIt could be the first identified case of pigs infected in the recent outbreak.\n\n\"We have determined that the virus H1N1, found in these pigs, is the virus which is being tracked in the human population,\" said Brian Evans of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.\n\nBut Evans and other officials said it is not uncommon for flu viruses to jump from humans to animals, and that it does not pose a risk for consuming pork. The number of pigs infected was not disclosed.\n\nIn his weekly radio address Saturday, President Obama said the concerns over the new virus are justified because lack of immunity makes it potentially risky.\n\n\"Unlike the various strains of animal flu that were in the past, it's a flu that is spreading from human to human. This creates the potential for a pandemic, which is why we are acting quickly and aggressively,\" Obama said.\n\nThe president, who said the virus is a \"cause for concern but not alarm,\" added the government has anti-viral treatment to treat the current strain of H1N1.\n\nIn addition, WHO started distributing 2.4 million doses of a common anti-viral drug to 72 nations. iReport.com: How should H1N1 be handled?\n\n\"I think the world is infinitely better prepared than it was 90 years ago,\" said WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl, referring to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic that killed as many as 20 million people.\n\nIn Mexico, the epicenter of the outbreak, masks have become a common fixture. Nearly half the cases in Mexico involve patients 19 and younger, the health ministry said.\n\n\"I can hold for maybe another week or two and that's it,\" said Guillermo Jimenez, a waiter who hasn't worked in a week since the government ordered about 35,000 public venues to shut down. \"We don't have any money. We have mouths to feed. I don't know what I'm going to do now.\"\n\nStill, some say the hype over H1N1 has led to undue hysteria.\n\n\"I'm sure the deaths in Mexico have something do with the infrastructure,\" said Anthony Markovich, a graduate student in Marina del Ray, California. \"I know our health care system has its flaws, but it is more advanced.\"\n\nThe world should focus on diseases that have more fatalities, according to Markovich.\n\n\"This is a joke compared to other things going on,\" he said. \"Malaria is killing thousands of people daily, the economy is not getting any better, it is time to move on.\"\n\nadvertisement\nPakistan resident Faisal Kapadia agreed.\n\n\"When you put it in context, 700 cases in the world is nothing,\" said Kapadia, a commodities trader in Karachi. \"I understand it is a horrible new disease and governments should find a cure for it, but the media has created too much paranoia.\"",

Dr. Margaret Chan, the U.N. agency's director-general, said the decision to raise the alert on the 6-point scale indicated that all countries should \"immediately\" activate pandemic preparedness plans.\n\n\"This change to a higher phase of alert is a signal to governments, to ministries of health and other ministries, to the pharm industry and the business community that certain actions now should be taken with increased urgency and at an accelerated pace,\" Chan said.\n\nThe announcement came as the number of confirmed cases increased rapidly across the world.\n\nThe WHO and national governments have confirmed 148 cases in nine countries. Most of those cases are in the United States, where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 91 cases.\n\nThe figures include seven deaths in Mexico and one in the United States. More than 2,700 other patients worldwide are believed to be suffering from the virus that government officials call by its technical name, 2009 H1N1.\n\nThe first cases of the virus were detected in Mexico, where health officials suspect swine flu in more than 150 other deaths and roughly 2,500 illnesses.

            "Text": "(CNN) -- With mostly mild cases of swine flu in the United States, swine flu fears are lessening. But viruses have a way of re-appearing. While nobody has a crystal ball, here are some thoughts about what the 2009 H1N1 virus might do in the months to come. 1. Is the swine flu outbreak in the United States winding down?\n\nNot yet. Health officials expect to see more cases.\n\nHowever, there are two reasons to think the 2009 H1N1 outbreak will wind down in the coming weeks. First, cases of influenza tend to dwindle when the weather gets warmer. Second, the 2009 H1N1 virus outbreak in Mexico has reached its peak, and numbers there are going down. It is expected that same pattern could happen in the United States. For the latest information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, click here.  Look at a map of swine flu cases \u00bb\n\n2. So does this mean 2009 H1N1 will be gone for good?\n\nNo. Andrew Pekosz, associate professor of immunology and microbiology at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, says it's important to keep in mind that the 2009 H1N1 virus is new, which means no one has immunity to it. He points out that the three outbreaks in the last century that were caused by new viruses -- in 1918, 1957 and 1968 -- started with a mild wave followed by more severe waves months later. Scientists dig for lessons from past pandemics\n\n3. If swine flu comes back, when would it return?\n\n\"H1N1 flu could die down soon and return later again this fall when the flu season enters back in full swing,\" says Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano. \"This is always a concern with a new strain of a flu virus.\" Video Watch more answers to your swine flu questions \u00bb\n\nNapolitano adds that public health officials will be keeping a close eye on the Southern Hemisphere, where flu season starts soon. \"We'll be working very closely with the international community to understand what happens to this virus over the next few months as flu season begins in the Southern Hemisphere,\" she says. \"That will tell us a lot about whether the virus is changing, whether it's becoming more severe and what measures we might want to take in the fall.\" For the latest comments from Napolitano, click here. 4. In the fall, could we have a pandemic like we had in 1918?\n\nAt a press briefing last week, World Health Organization spokesman Gregory Hartl brought up the specter of the 1918 pandemic, which killed more than half a million people in the United States. \"In 1918, that pandemic started out as a very mild case of disease in the spring of 1918. ... Cases of the disease almost completely disappeared over the summer, only to reappear in the autumn of 1918 with the vengeance which we all know,\" he said. \"So even though we might be only seeing mild cases now, we cannot say what will happen in the future.\"  Learn more about the swine flu \u00bb\n\nBut many experts believe it's highly unlikely there would be an outbreak anything like 1918. First of all, scientists have a much better understanding of infectious diseases, and health care has improved greatly since 1918. Secondly, the 2009 H1N1 lacks a gene that is present in highly virulent flu viruses, such as the one in 1918.\n\n\"I don't think this virus has what it takes to become a major problem,\" says Peter Palese, chairman of the department of microbiology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.\n\nJohns Hopkins' Pekosz adds that people remember the horrific 1918 flu season, but often forget that the two other flu outbreaks caused by new viruses, the ones in 1957 and 1968, were far more mild.\n\n5. Will there be a vaccine for swine flu?\n\nScientists are already working on a vaccine for 2009 H1N1. Making a new vaccine takes five to six months, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe first step is for government scientists to grow \"seed stock\" of the virus to send to pharmaceutical companies, who would turn that stock into a vaccine. Pilot lots of the vaccine would then be tested on people. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases alerted its eight vaccine testing centers to be ready to test a 2009 H1N1 vaccine.\n\n6. Will the vaccine be a separate shot, or will it be put in the regular seasonal flu shot?\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control has said either is possible. Pekosz says there are concerns the seasonal flu shot might not work well if it includes the 2009 H1N1 vaccine, and so the decision might be made to make a separate shot.\n\n7. If a vaccine is available in the fall, who will get it?\n\nadvertisement\nPublic health officials have emphasized that even if a vaccine is available by fall, it doesn't mean everyone will be encouraged to get it. \"I imagine that the choice of vaccination strategy will be a subject of intense discussion and study over the next several months,\" says Dr. Ted Cohen, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nCohen adds that if the vaccine is available only in limited quantities, priority might be given to health care workers and to those at high risk of complications from the flu, such as the elderly, the very young and those with certain chronic diseases.",

            "Text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global flu pandemic after holding an emergency meeting.\n\nIt means the swine flu virus is spreading in at least two regions of the world with rising cases being seen in the UK, Australia, Japan and Chile.\n\nWHO chief Dr Margaret Chan said the move did not mean the virus was causing more severe illness or more deaths.\n\nThe swine flu (H1N1) virus first emerged in Mexico in April and has since spread to 74 countries. Official reports say there have been nearly 30,000 cases globally and 141 deaths, with figures rising daily.\n\nHong Kong said it was closing all its nurseries and primary schools for two weeks following 12 school cases.\n\nIt is the first flu pandemic in 40 years - the last in 1968 killed about one million people.\n\nHowever, the current pandemic seems to be moderate and causing mild illness in most people.\n\nMost cases are occurring in young working age adults and a third to a half of complications are presenting in otherwise healthy people.\n\nDr Chan said: \"We have evidence to suggest we are seeing the first pandemic of the 21st Century.\n\n\"Moving to pandemic phase six does not imply we will see increased in deaths or serious cases.\"\n\nShe added it was important to get the right balance between complacency and vigilance and that pandemic strategies would vary between countries depending on their specific situation. And the WHO does not recommend closure of borders or any restrictions on the movement of people, goods or services.\n\nBut the picture could change very quickly.\n\n\"No other pandemic has been detected so early or watched so closely,\" Dr Chan said.\n\nUN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for calm.\n\n\"Let me stress: this is a formal statement about the geographical spread of the disease. It is not in itself a cause for alarm,\" he said.\n\nHe warned that in the developing world the consequences of the virus could be more serious, and that the southern hemisphere was now entering the flu season.\n\nOne factor which has prompted the move to a level six pandemic was that in the southern hemisphere, the virus seems to be crowding out normal seasonal influenza. The move was not prompted by the situation in any one country but the reports that it had spread in several parts of the world, officials said.\n\nThe BBC's Imogen Foulkes, in Geneva, says that while the number of cases has made the declaration inevitable, the WHO will have to manage the global anxiety the declaration of a pandemic will generate.\n\nExperts have warned that poorer nations, especially those in the southern hemisphere now heading into their winter season, face the greatest risk from the flu pandemic.\n\nPandemic planning\n\nThere have been more than 800 cases in the UK with some areas of Scotland being particularly hard hit.\n\nThe government has been stockpiling antivirals such as Tamiflu and has ordered vaccine, some doses of which could be available by October. England's chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson said the WHO declaration of a pandemic would not significantly change the way the UK was dealing with swine flu at the moment.\n\nBut he added there could be some minor changes to who received antivirals.\n\n\"The declaration of a pandemic per se doesn't make a big difference to the way we are handling the outbreaks we have.\n\n\"We are going to continue to investigate every case that occurs and treat their contacts with antivirals even though they may not be ill.\n\n\"The difference is that the Health Protection Agency has learnt a lot about approaching this question of antiviral prophylaxis and they are going to be treating the closer contacts of the cases, rather than the more far-flung contacts, because they feel that that is supported by what they know so far about how the disease is transmitting.\n\nHe added: \"These flu viruses can change their pattern of attack, so when we come into the flu season in the autumn and winter in this country, when we expect a big surge of cases, we need to watch very carefully to see if the character of the virus is changing.\" Scottish health secretary Nicola Sturgeon said a move to level six means that countries need to be ready to implement pandemic plans immediately but the UK was already operating at a \"heightened state of readiness\".\n\nBut it could affect the speed at which the UK gets pandemic vaccine supplies but that had been factored into pandemic planning.\n\nFlu expert Professor John Oxford said people should not panic as the outbreak was milder than others seen in the past century.\n\n\"It is global and fulfilling the requirements of a pandemic but I don't think anyone should worry because nothing drastic has happened between yesterday and today.\"",

            "Text": "With the UK confirming two cases of swine flu and the World Health Organization raising its alert level from three to four, how serious a threat does the disease pose to us all?\n\nWHO says the virus, which has killed an estimated 150 people in Mexico, is showing a \"sustained ability\" to pass from human to human and is able to cause community-level outbreaks.\n\nThe UK's leading experts on flu give their views on what the future threat might be. Clearly we are on track for a pandemic in the coming months.\n\nThe good news is that we were all worried about so-called bird flu H5N1 which was a much more dangerous virus. Here, we are not in the same ball park. But we can't at the moment answer the question is it comparable to 1918 Spanish flu which killed a lot of people - or is it much more like Hong Kong flu.\n\nWe are coming out of the normal time of year when we have flu circulating in the UK so we don't really know what size of epidemic there may be in the next couple of months.\n\nIt is almost certain that even if it does fade away in the next few weeks which it might we will get a sizable epidemic in the autumn.\n\nWe might expect up to 30-40% of the population to become ill in the next six months if this truly turns into a pandemic.\n\nWe could get substantial numbers infected in the next few weeks. If I was to be a betting man I would say it would be a slightly longer period of time just because we are heading into the summer months. SIR LIAM DONALDSON, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER FOR ENGLAND\nA new strain of flu is something to which we do not have natural immunity, and we have not been vaccinated against, because there is not a vaccine, so it does mean that many more people are vulnerable and so it spreads more easily and affects more people.\n\nBut we don't know enough about this virus yet. It is being studied by the top laboratories in the world.\n\nWhen we know more about it we will be able to give better predictions about who is at greater risk, and who is at risk of developing serious complications.\n\nAt this point the picture coming out of Mexico is rather confused, and we can't make any firm statements about what is likely to happen, but we have to prepare for all eventualities.\n\nPROFESSOR JOHN OXFORD, VIROLOGY EXPERT AT BARTS AND THE LONDON\nIf the avian flu H5N1 virus had spread from human to human like this then I would be extremely worried. It would be top of my Richter scale.\n\nBut this swine flu worries me less because as a population we have a basic immunity to H1N1. Outside of Mexico there have been no deaths, so it doesn't seem so aggressive.\n\nAnd not only are we coming up to the summer, which makes it less likely for these viruses to spread as well, but Britain has enough antiviral drugs for half of the population.\n\nSo we should not panic in any way. This does not look as though it is going to be a virus that sweeps the world and causes huge mortality.\n\nDR ALAN MACNALLY, MOLECULAR BIOLOGY EXPERT AT NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIVERSITY\nI still think we are a day or so away from knowing what the threat is. WHO has gone to stage four, so we know there will be an epidemic stemming from direct contact with these cases in Mexico. We will see more cases.\n\nBut we will have to wait to see how it spreads to know if there will be a pandemic that sweeps nations.\n\nThe key thing is how lethal a virus is it. Outside of Mexico it has not caused any deaths, which is good news. And we are prepared for it.\n\nWe should have a complete picture in the next five to seven days to answer these questions.\n\nKEITH PLUMB, FELLOW OF THE INSTITUTION OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERS\nThere is no evidence of pandemic in Europe at this point in time but should the threat increase, the UK has a wealth of scientific and engineering expertise which can be deployed to ramp up the countermeasures necessary to protect the population at large.\n\nLet's keep things in perspective. This is not 1918; and with over 30 million doses of antiviral treatments, effective against H1N1 available in the UK right now we are well placed to combat any outbreak.\n\nWe should also bear in mind that there are two flu-vaccine manufacturers in the UK (Novartis and Medimmune) and whilst there may be capacity issues, both companies are technically capable of producing appropriate vaccines.\n\nPROFESSOR HUGH PENNINGTON, LEADING BACTERIOLOGIST\nIt's a new virus - we've never before seen this combination of swine virus and human virus genes.\n\nIt's very difficult to make any predictions when it's not like any flu virus before.\n\nIf there are no more cases in the next couple of weeks then we can maybe say with reasonable confidence that we're out of the woods.\n\nBut the flu virus is a pretty awkward customer and you have to be very circumspect.\n\nI don't think the public health authorities will be giving the all-clear for some time yet.\n\nPROFESSOR ANGUS NICOLL, EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR DISEASE PREVENTION AND CONTROL\nWe have a very confusing picture coming out of Mexico.\n\nWe are not aware of how many people there are with mild infections out of Mexico. It may be that those few deaths represent just the tip of an iceberg which is a lot more much milder infections.\n\nTherefore we feel that one should not be looking at Mexico and saying that is the pattern we will necessarily be following in Europe.\n\nWe do know from previous influenza viruses and previous pandemics that what you see at the start is not necessarily what you see six months, a year or two years later. Sometimes you get a second or third wave which is more vicious than the first.\n\nAs a region, Europe - and particularly the European Union - is better prepared than any other part of the world.\n\nUnfortunately you can never prepare well enough. We are beyond the stage of being able to contain the virus, we can only mitigate it and there is still more work to be done - and a cool summer would give us time to do some additional work.",

More than 1,000 US deaths have been linked to the virus.\n\nHealth officials say the infections are already comparable to peak season flu levels.\n\nVaccine warning\n\nUS officials said the president's declaration was similar to ones issued before hurricanes make landfall. It allows authorities to bypass certain federal requirements in order to deal more effectively with emergencies.\n\nThe aim of the directive is to remove bureaucratic hurdles, allowing sick patients to receive treatment more quickly and giving health-care providers more flexibility in providing it.\n\nPaperwork on patients can be reduced and additional health centres set up outside hospitals to care for the sick.\n\nIn his proclamation statement, Mr Obama says the 2009 H1N1 pandemic \"continues to evolve\".\n\n\"The rates of illness continue to rise rapidly within many communities across the nation, and the potential exists for the pandemic to overburden health care resources in some localities.\"\n\nHe said the US had already taken \"proactive steps\" by implementing public health measures and developing an effective swine flu vaccine.\n\nHowever, the government has admitted there are delays in the delivery of vaccines.\n\nIt had hoped to roll out 120 million doses by mid-October.\n\nIt now hopes for about 50 million by mid-November and 150 million in December.\n\nDr Thomas Frieden, of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said on Friday: \"We are nowhere near where we thought we'd be by now.\"\n\nGiven the shortfall, New York State on Friday stayed a directive ordering health care staff to be inoculated or risk losing their jobs.\n\nThe CDC says widespread influenza activity in 46 states is \"unprecedented during seasonal flu\".\n\nIt said the hospitalisation rates for laboratory-confirmed swine flu were still climbing.\n\nAlthough figures are hard to verify, it is thought H1N1 has hospitalised about 20,000 people in the US.\n\nVisits to the doctor for influenza-like illnesses were also much higher than expected for the time of year, the CDC said.\n\nThe seasonal flu peak is usually between late November and early March.\n\nChildren and young adults have been among the hardest hit by H1N1. Almost 100 of the deaths have been children.",

            "HeadLine": "WHO faces questions over swine flu policy",
            "Text": "As the 193 member states of the World Health Organization meet in Geneva, questions over the body's handling of the H1N1 swine flu pandemic are high on the agenda.\n\nSome medical experts doubt whether this was really a pandemic at all.\n\nFor several years before swine flu first surfaced in Mexico in April 2009, WHO officials had been warning that a global influenza pandemic was simply a matter of time.\n\nAfter major pandemics in 1918, 1957 and 1968, many flu experts believed another one was imminent. Though the recent H5N1 bird flu virus had not developed the ability to spread easily among humans, it raised concerns that a new virus might do so.\n\n\"We have seen 40 to 50 million people die in a year in previous pandemics,\" explained Keiji Fukuda, who is the WHO's assistant director general, and its special adviser on pandemic influenza.\n\n\"These are huge numbers. Our job is to get people prepared, it's a huge challenge.\"\n\nSo, even before swine flu emerged, the WHO supported member states in drawing up pandemic plans, including buying antiviral drugs, preparing mass vaccination campaigns, and developing procedures for banning public gatherings and closing schools.\n\nBy the time swine flu broke out, many countries had already introduced the plans, and some industrialised nations had even signed pre-contracts with the pharmaceutical companies to buy vaccines.\n\n'Mild flu'\nBut even as the pandemic plans were put into action, doubts had begun to surface. Dr Wolfgang Wodarg, a German doctor and former member of parliament, had been watching the spread of swine flu in Mexico City, and was puzzled at the reaction of the WHO. \"What we experienced in Mexico City was a very mild flu,\" he explained, \"which did not kill more than usual - which killed even less people than usual.\n\n\"This was suddenly, a fast-spreading mild flu, a pandemic. But this is not the definition of a pandemic I learned, which has to be severe, with a much higher than usual death rate.\"\n\nOthers also had questions. Tom Jefferson, a researcher for the international Cochrane Centre, the world's leading independent assessor of medical interventions and medical research, claims that the WHO changed the definition of what a pandemic actually was just weeks before it declared one on 11 June last year.\n\n\"On 1 May the WHO's global pandemic website had the old definition of an influenza pandemic, which included very large numbers of cases, complications and deaths,\" he said.\n\n\"By 4 May that definition had disappeared and what remained was simply a new virus which spreads rapidly and infects very many people.\"\n\nDr Jefferson also believes that the WHO advice put emphasis on the use of vaccines and antivirals, ahead of effective and inexpensive measures like hand-washing.\n\n'Potential pressure'\nThe WHO has struggled to offer clear answers on the question of its definition of a pandemic, partly because of its policy of keeping the identity and the deliberations of its pandemic emergency advisory committee secret.\n\nThe only known member of the committee is its chairman, Australian flu specialist John MacKenzie. WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said names of those on the sitting committee had not been made public because of the potential \"for bringing undue pressure on them when they are making decisions which have societal and economic impacts\".\n\nThe lack of transparency in its decision making process, together with the WHO's advice to countries to begin widespread vaccination against swine flu, has led some observers to suspect undue influence from the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nLooking at the balance sheets of the pharmaceutical companies it is clear that many did make a healthy profit out of swine flu. Vaccine producer Novartis, for example, posted an 8% jump in profit in 2009.\n\nThe company's annual report cites swine flu vaccine sales as a major reason for the increase - though such a profit is, of course, not proof of any undue influence by the firm.\n\nEuropean enquiry\nThese medical products have cost national health budgets billions. France, for example, spent over 600m euros ($739m, \u00a3515m) on 94 million doses of vaccine, most of which have not been used.\n\n\"Who benefited from what happened?\" asked British Labour Member of Parliament Paul Flynn. \"Really the only people to benefit were the pharmaceutical companies. I'm not saying I'm drawing any firm conclusions, but there are legitimate questions here.\" Mr Flynn and a number of other European politicians have launched an official inquiry into the pandemic at the Council of Europe. A key question will be whether the pharmaceutical companies, which had invested around $4bn in developing the swine flu vaccine, had supporters inside the emergency committee, who then put pressure on the WHO to declare a pandemic.\n\nBut Andrin Oswald, head of vaccine production at Novartis, says he does not think the company's influence is \"too great\".\n\nHe says company officials interact in a \"natural process\" with the WHO, which supplies the firm with the virus for the vaccine.\n\n\"I don't think that is influencing, that is working together to ensure that we do something that is reasonable for public health.\"\n\nHe adds that any pressure over swine flu came from governments desperate to buy the vaccine, rather than from producers keen to sell it.\n\n\"We received phone calls from government ministers,\" he recalled, \"telling us to ship them more vaccine, and quicker. Some even threatened us that if we did not do so it might affect our future business in that particular country.\"\n\nPandemic planning\nGovernments, of course, were under pressure to buy the vaccine because the WHO had declared swine flu to be a full \"Phase 6\" pandemic.\n\nHere again, the WHO's decision is questioned, from a somewhat surprising source - Dr Klaus Stoehr, who until three years ago was in charge of the WHO's pandemic preparedness, and the man who drew up the influenza plans. \"The pandemic planning I was involved with was always based on a severe public health event,\" he explained. \"Moving to Phase 6 meant that we wanted governments\u2026 to kick in their plans whether they thought it was urgent or not.\"\n\n\"I personally think that moving to Phase 6 that early was, in hindsight, not needed.\"\n\nDr Stoehr believes that, over the course of last summer, after a Phase 6 pandemic was declared, the WHO failed to read the signs about swine flu coming from the southern hemisphere winter.\n\n\"In July and August the Australia and New Zealand national influenza centres were indicating the southern hemisphere outbreak was mild,\" he said.\n\n\"Virologists, myself included, thought well, it's not so likely that this virus will become more severe.\"\n\n\"At the end of August the WHO website was still calling the virus severe. I personally would have thought there could have been more assessments, and more advice to governments.\"\n\nThe WHO has now launched its own review of its handling of the pandemic, a review the organisation claims is independent.\n\n\"The World Health Organization has done wonderful work over the years in eliminating diseases,\" insisted British MP Paul Flynn. \"It's a body we all greatly respect, and we need it.\"\n\n\"The great danger now is that the trust in the organisation has been undermined, and that will help no-one.\"\n\nTo hear Imogen Foulkes' report on the WHO and swine flu for the BBC World Service's Assignment programme, click here",

The official guidance for England is to wear a reusable, washable one where possible.\n\nIt also states that used disposable face coverings - often containing the plastic polypropylene - should be put in \"black bag\" waste bins \"or a litter bin if you're outside\".\n\nIt adds that people should \"not put them in a recycling bin as they cannot be recycled through conventional recycling facilities\" and \"take them home... if there is no litter bin - do not drop them as litter\". But with the public being told to cover their faces, environmental groups say hundreds of thousands, even millions, of single-use masks are being dumped outdoors, blighting towns and the countryside.\n\nAs part of its Great British Beach Clean, running from 18 to 25 September, the Marine Conservation Society is asking volunteers to record how many they pick up.\n\nLaura Foster, the organisation's head of clean seas, said: \"Just look at rivers such as the Thames and you'll see them floating by.\n\n\"When they're whole, wildlife's going to get tangled in it or the plastic's going to be ingested.

Wearing face coverings is a vital part of that, but it shouldn't cost the earth.\n\n\"It's clear that single-use face masks are creating an enormous amount of waste. Outside of essential clinical settings, there are plenty of environmentally friendly, reusable alternatives that people can choose to use.\" Amelia Womack, deputy leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, said the surge in disposable mask use came \"at a time when we are clearly drowning in plastic\".\n\nShe called for \"stronger government guidance\", with the public potentially being asked to wear coverings \"for years\" if the pandemic continues.\n\nThe media should be discouraged from showing masks in \"normal\", non-clinical, situations, Ms Womack added, also arguing that the government should impose a ban on its own websites, leaflets and films doing so.\n\nA government spokesperson said: \"Our priority is rightly to protect public health, but government and the NHS are actively looking at how PPE can be reused in safe ways, including decontamination.\"\n\nThey added: \"We have published guidance on how to wear and make a cloth face covering and how to safely dispose of PPE.\n\n\"Over the next couple of months, we are considering how we can inform the UK's longer-term PPE use strategy into the future, including taking into account environmental concerns.\"",

These platforms have much greater penetration per head of population.\nIndia's public broadcaster, Doordarshan, has been broadcasting daily educational content through its television channels and radio services.\nBangladesh's government broadcaster, Sangsad television, also airs recorded classes on its channels.\n\"These were among the most successful approaches... in terms of reaching the largest proportion of children,\" Jean Gough, Unicef's South Asia director told the BBC.\nIs the true scale of coronavirus in South Asia hidden?\nNepal adopted a similar approach, but fewer than half of households have access to cable television.\nOpening schools 'risks infection'\nIn Sri Lanka, where schools have now reopened, no social distancing is being maintained and only some have made it mandatory to wear a mask, according to Joseph Stalin, general secretary of the Ceylon Teachers' Union.\nBasic safety measures are difficult to implement \"as no special funding has been allocated\", he told the BBC's Sinhala service.\nThe All Pakistan Private Schools Federation has opposed the reopening of schools in September saying they need government funding to help carry out testing and to implement coronavirus safety guidelines.\nIn India, there are similar concerns about the prospect of schools starting classes again.\n\"With the reopening of schools, parents, transportation, teachers other service providers will also start functioning and will increase public movement,\" Priti Mahara, of Child Rights and You, told the BBC. The long period of closure has also led to serious financial shortfalls for those private schools relying on tuition fees.\nIn Bangladesh, more than a hundred private schools have been put up for sale.\n\"I have already borrowed money to pay salaries and rent,\" Taqbir Ahmed, owner of one such school in Dhaka told BBC Bengali.\nSeveral charities in the region have tried to help the most vulnerable and marginalised schools.\nDr Rukmini Banerji, of the Pratham Education Foundation in India, says: \"Efforts have been made by state governments and schools to connect with children who have at least one mobile phone in the household.\"\nIn some cases, students have dropped off the educational roll as the authorities have been unable to establish contact with them.\nThis could cause the school dropout rate in these countries to rise \"exponentially\", says Unicef's Jean Gough, if effective communication isn't put in place.\n\"Projections based on previous school shutdowns due to Ebola and other emergencies suggest that there can be very significant losses in terms of learning,\" Ms Gough told the BBC.\nAdditional research by Waliur Rahman Miraj, Muhammad Shahnewaj and Saroj Pathirana",

            "Text": "People across England have told BBC News they are struggling to access coronavirus tests.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said last week that no-one should have to travel more than 75 miles for a test, after the BBC revealed some were being sent hundreds of miles away.\n\nBut dozens have now reported being unable to book a swab at all.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said testing capacity was targeted at the hardest-hit areas.\n\nA significant rise in demand for testing led the government to reduce the number of appointments available in areas of lower prevalence, to prioritise areas with outbreaks.\n\nThis in turn led to people applying for tests being directed to centres sometimes hundreds of miles away.\n\nR number above 1 as coronavirus cases rise\nWhat are the challenges of mass testing?\nConcerns over PM's mass virus testing plans\nBut last Thursday Mr Hancock pledged to put in \"immediate\" solutions to make sure people did not have to travel more than 75 miles, effective from last Friday.\n\nSince then, postcodes entered into the government's booking system return a message suggesting there are no testing centres or home kits available - even if you are an essential worker with symptoms. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said he understood it would be \"naturally worrying\" for people with symptoms who could not secure a test in a \"timely way\".\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the testing system was under \"pressure\" because of the spike in the infection rate of the virus.\n\nMr Gove said: \"We are increasing the number of tests. It is the case that the capacity every day is for 370,000 - we do want to do more.\"\n\nHe added that No 10 is working to boost capacity through investment in new testing centres and so-called lighthouse labs.\n\n'Complete nightmare'\n\nMelissa, a GP in north-west England, applied for a test for her seven-year-old son on Tuesday after he developed a new continuous cough and changes to his sense of taste.\n\nAfter being offered a test in Sunderland, about 130 miles away, she applied via her local NHS's staff portal - designed to prioritise health staff.\n\nBut this system directed her first to Telford, almost 100 miles away, and then to London, a distance of more than 200 miles.\n\nNo home kits were available.\n\n\"It was a complete nightmare,\" she said. \"I had to cancel face-to-face appointments with patients, including baby clinics.\"\n\nGovernment apologises over Covid tests shortage\nHow do I get a coronavirus test?\nShe added that this had become a common theme in NHS Facebook groups of which she was a member.\n\n\"The whole system is going to fall over.\n\n\"It doesn't feel like the infrastructure is there to support NHS staff going into winter.\"\n\nThis sentiment was echoed by a psychiatrist in an area currently subject to government intervention because of its high rate of coronavirus.\n\nShe found that no tests were available after developing all of the textbook coronavirus symptoms, including a cough and a fever.\n\n'Glitch in the system'\nFrances, in Suffolk, tried to apply for a test when her daughter developed a high temperature. She didn't think it was coronavirus but \"the rules are the rules\".\n\nShe had understood that anyone with a temperature should apply for a test, and was not able to send either of her children to school until she did.\n\n\"Their teachers need to be kept safe, their classmates need to be kept safe, we need to do the right thing,\" she said.\n\nFrances, like Melissa, was also not able to get a home kit, and when she tried to get an appointment at a drive-through centre was told no test sites were found.\n\n\"It almost looks like a glitch in the system,\" she said. Jamie in Chesterfield spent seven hours trying to contact someone using the 119 number after no slots were appearing on the online booking system.\n\nHis school-age child had developed a new cough.\n\n\"It's the right thing to do according to the guidelines,\" he said.\n\nEventually he managed to get a test 50 miles away.\n\nMeanwhile in Wales, the leader of Rhondda Cynon Taff council, which is struggling to avoid a local lockdown, said he was \"furious\" about the limited testing capacity.\n\nAndrew Morgan said a \"huge effort\" had to be made after learning that mobile testing units in Wales were to be limited to only 60 tests.\n\nIt comes as a number of different data sources show cases are rising and the epidemic is growing for the first time since before lockdown.\n\nOn Saturday, the number of new daily confirmed UK cases of the virus rose to 3,497 - the second day running it has been above 3,000.\n\nThe virus is still at much lower levels across the UK than at the peak in April, but a study of thousands of people in England found cases doubling every seven to eight days, with a marked rise in infections in the north and among young people.\n\nAlthough cases are rising, the number of patients in hospital remains largely flat at 863.",

Then there are the weekend gatherings including house parties. While they are only doing what young people are expected to do - unfortunately for this generation there are ramifications.\n\nOn the whole, younger people can cope with Covid-19. They may survive the symptoms but medics know when passed onto older and more vulnerable people, the outcome can be very different.\n\nFreshers' week looming\nCovid-19 loves those who socialise and considering that freshers' week for universities is looming, the virus could be about to have a field day.\n\nPeople heading back to University, according to officials, is their biggest concern.\n\nWhile it's a headache for every country, compared to the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is different as there are a substantial number of students who study in cities but return home to communities at the weekend.\n\nWhile universities have plans in place to mitigate the spread of the virus on campus, those plans could be left at the door when students return home to their own communities.\n\nThere will be those who will travel home together in packed cars and who won't wear face coverings.\n\nPlans will be made to catch up with friends and older relations. These are all normal activities but these are not normal times. Professor Ian Young appealed to students to act responsibly. If sharing a car those on board should wear masks and maintain social distancing.\n\nThat could mean only two people travelling together unless they are already living together.\n\nThe only way we can navigate our way out of this pandemic is by finding a vaccine.\n\nBut until we reach that point the regulations are there for a reason.\n\nBy following them we can continue to open up society as opposed to closing down.",

            "Text": "Public health officials have warned of \"worrying signs\" of infection among the elderly, as an official measure indicated the UK's epidemic is growing again.\n\nThe R number was raised to between 1 and 1.2 for the first time since March.\n\nAny number above one indicates the number of infections is increasing.\n\nThe number of new daily confirmed UK cases of the virus rose to 3,539 on Friday - an increase of more than 600 on the previous day.\n\nThe virus is still at much lower levels across the UK than at the peak in April, but a study of thousands of people in England found cases doubling every seven to eight days.\n\nIt found a marked rise in infections in the north and among young people.\n\nYvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said although younger people made up the greatest share of new cases, \"we're now starting to see worrying signs of infections occurring in the elderly, who are at far higher risk of getting seriously ill\".\n\nA PHE report says there has been \"a particularly steep increase\" in positive test results in the over-85s and, in the north-west of England, a rise in people from that age group being admitted to hospital. However, though cases are rising, the number of patients in hospital remains largely flat at 863.\n\nOf those, 78 are on ventilators, according to the latest government figures.\n\nWhat are the new rules for meeting my friends?\nBehind the rise in Covid cases in five charts\nHow do I get a coronavirus test?\nMs Doyle warned people to follow social distancing rules, wash their hands regularly and wear a face covering in enclosed spaces.\n\nMeanwhile, Birmingham will become the latest area to bring in new restrictions after a spike in cases.\n\nTougher restrictions now cover more than 1.75m people in the west of Scotland and, from Monday, face masks must be worn in shops in Wales.\n\nHowever, lockdown restrictions will be eased further in Leicester on Tuesday to bring rules for businesses in the city more in line with the majority of England, the Department of Health said.\n\nThe city has been subject to tighter Covid-19 restrictions since 29 June after a rise in cases.\n\nAcross the UK, new laws on how many people can socialise are being introduced from Monday in an attempt to hold back the rise in infections.\n\nThe \"rule of six\" will restrict indoor and outdoor gatherings in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Police warned there was a \"real risk\" some people would treat this weekend as a \"party weekend\" before the new restrictions come in.\n\nJohn Apter, national chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said that would be \"incredibly irresponsible\" at a time of increasing cases and officers would \"make no apology\" for fining people where appropriate.\n\nThe rise in the R (reproduction) number - which describes how many others each infected person passes the virus on to - is one of several measures indicating the virus is spreading more widely in the UK.\n\nIf the R number is higher than one - as now - the numbers infected are growing, with higher numbers indicating that cases are multiplying more quickly.\n\nThree other large studies have also indicated a widespread resurgence of coronavirus across the UK population. The UK is entering a new stage of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSince lockdown, we have been deciding how to react to falling cases. But now the R number has gone above the crucial level of 1 for the first time since March and is backed up by reams of data showing cases are growing again.\n\nThis is not just contained to hotspots like Bolton - one government adviser told me the rise was widespread across the country.\n\nThey said today was a \"wake-up call\" for the nation. There are already some signs that the number of people being admitted to hospital is starting to rise.\n\nBut this is not a repeat of the build-up to lockdown. Cases are at a much lower level and they are growing more slowly.\n\nPre-lockdown, the R number was around three and cases were doubling every three to four days. It is around half that now.\n\nCoronavirus is going to be a major challenge until we have a vaccine.\n\nSo the defining question as we head into a potentially difficult winter is how to balance keeping the virus in check with getting on with our lives. The REACT study of more than 150,000 volunteers in England, one of the three new sources of data on community levels, found \"accelerating transmission\" at the end of August and start of September.\n\nIt said levels of infection were rising across England but particularly in the north east, north west and Yorkshire.\n\nMerseyside 'becomes an area of concern'\nTyneside and Wearside areas added to Covid list\nLockdown restrictions extended to Lanarkshire\nAnd there were increases in positive cases in all age groups up to the age of 65, with highest rates of growth in 18-24 year olds.\n\nProf Paul Elliott, director of the study at Imperial College London, said the data clearly showed \"a concerning trend in coronavirus infections\" where cases are growing quickly across England and \"no longer concentrated in key workers\".\n\nHe said there was evidence of \"an epidemic in the community\" which was not the result of more people being tested. The second set of data, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates there were 39,700 new cases of the virus in England during the first week in September - 11,000 more than the previous week.\n\nThe ONS bases its figures on thousands of swab tests carried out in households, whether people have symptoms or not.\n\nIt estimated no increase in cases for the same week in Wales, but First Minister Mark Drakeford has announced people must now wear face masks in shops in response to rising case numbers in recent days.\n\nKatherine Kent, from the ONS infection survey, said the results suggested \"an increase in Covid-19 infections in England during recent weeks, with higher infection rates among 17-34 year olds\". Nicola Sturgeon has warned that the average number of cases in Scotland has been \"more than trebling every three weeks\" with some areas of particular concern, including Lanarkshire and Greater Glasgow and Clyde.\n\nAnd the third set of figures, from the Covid symptom study app, which tracks the health of nearly four million people in the UK, also suggests a growth in new cases since the end of August - the first time since mid-June there has been a significant rise in numbers.\n\nProf James Naismith, from the University of Oxford, said younger people would also have been affected to the same extent in January if testing had been available.\n\n\"We know that medical treatment and scientific advances have improved significantly, thus even with infection rates as bad as March and April, there will be many fewer deaths.\n\n\"The more people wash their hands and practise social distancing - especially by and around the vulnerable - the lower the number of deaths and illness we will see,\" he said.",

            "HeadLine": "Coronavirus: Who would get the vaccine first?",
            "Text": "If or when scientists succeed in making a coronavirus vaccine, there won't be enough to go around.\n\nResearch labs and pharmaceutical companies are rewriting the rulebook on the time it takes to develop, test and manufacture an effective vaccine.\n\nUnprecedented steps are being taken to ensure roll-out of the vaccine is global. But there are concerns that the race to get one will be won by the richest countries, at the expense of the most vulnerable.\n\nSo who will get it first, how much will it cost and, in a global crisis, how do we make sure nobody gets left behind?\n\nVaccines to fight infectious diseases usually take years to develop, test and deliver. Even then, their success is not guaranteed.\n\nTo date, only one human infectious disease has been totally eradicated - smallpox - and that took 200 years.\n\nThe rest - from polio to tetanus, measles, mumps and TB - we live with, or without, thanks to vaccinations.\n\nHow soon can we expect a coronavirus vaccine? Trials involving thousands of people are already under way to see which vaccine can protect against Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by coronavirus. A process that usually takes five to 10 years, from research to delivery, is being pared down to months. In the meantime, manufacturing is being scaled up - with investors and manufacturers risking billions of dollars to be ready to produce an effective vaccine.\n\nRussia says trials of its Sputnik-V vaccine have shown signs of an immune response in patients and mass vaccination will start in October. China says it has developed a successful vaccine that is being made available to its military personnel. But concerns have been raised about the speed at which both vaccines have been produced.\n\nNeither are on the World Health Organization's list of vaccines that have reached phase three clinical trials - the stage that involves more widespread testing in humans.\n\nSome of these leading candidates hope to get their vaccine approved by the end of the year - although the WHO has said it does not expect to see widespread vaccinations against Covid-19 until the middle of 2021. British drug manufacturer AstraZeneca, which has the licence for the Oxford University vaccine, is ramping up its global manufacturing capacity and has agreed to supply 100 million doses to the UK alone and possibly two billion globally - should it prove successful. Clinical trials were paused this week after a participant had a suspected adverse reaction in the UK.\n\nPfizer and BioNTech, who say they have invested more than $1bn in their Covid-19 programme developing an mRNA vaccine, expect to be ready to seek some form of regulatory approval as early as October this year.\n\nIf approved, that would mean manufacturing up to 100 million doses by the end of 2020 and potentially more than 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021.\n\nThere are around 20 other pharmaceutical companies with clinical trials under way.\n\nNot all of them will succeed - normally only about 10% of vaccine trials are successful. The hope is that the global focus, new alliances, and common purpose will raise the odds this time.\n\nBut even if one of these vaccines is successful, the immediate shortfall is clear.\n\nOxford vaccine trial paused as participant falls ill\nHow close to developing a vaccine are we?\nPreventing vaccine nationalism\nGovernments are hedging their bets to secure potential vaccines, making deals for millions of doses with a range of candidates before anything has been officially certified or approved.\n\nThe UK government, for example, has signed deals for undisclosed sums for six potential coronavirus vaccines that may or may not prove successful. The US hopes to get 300 million doses by January from its investment programme to fast-track a successful vaccine. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has even advised states to be prepared for a vaccine roll-out as early as 1 November.\n\nBut not all countries are in a position to do likewise.\n\nOrganisations such the Medecins Sans Frontieres, often on the frontline delivering vaccines, say locking in advanced deals with pharmaceutical companies creates \"a dangerous trend of vaccine nationalism by richer nations\".\n\nThis in turn reduces global stocks available to the vulnerable in poorer countries.\n\nIn the past, the price of life-saving vaccines has left countries struggling to fully immunise children against diseases such as meningitis, for example.\n\nDr Mari\u00e2ngela Sim\u00e3o, the WHO's assistant director-general responsible for access to medicines and health products, says we need to ensure vaccine nationalism is held in check.\n\n\"The challenge will be to ensure equitable access - that all countries have access, not just those who can pay more.\"\n\nIs there a global vaccine task force?\nThe WHO is working with the epidemic response group, Cepi, and the Vaccine Alliance of governments and organisations, known as Gavi, to try to level the playing field.\n\nAt least 80 rich nations and economies, so far, have signed up to the global vaccine plan known as Covax, which aims to raise $2bn (\u00a31.52bn) by the end of 2020 to help buy and fairly distribute a drug worldwide. The US, which wants to leave the WHO, is not one of them. By pooling resources in Covax, participants hope to guarantee 92 lower income countries, in Africa, Asia and Latin America, also get \"rapid, fair and equitable access\" to Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nThe facility is helping to fund a range of vaccine research and development work, and supporting manufacturers in scaling up production, where needed.\n\nHaving a wide portfolio of vaccine trials signed up to their programme, they are hoping at least one will be successful so they can deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines by the end of 2021.\n\n\"With COVID-19 vaccines we want things to be different,\" says Gavi's CEO Dr Seth Berkley. \"If only the wealthiest countries in the world are protected, then international trade, commerce and society as a whole will continue to be hit hard as the pandemic continues to rage across the globe.\"\n\nHow much will it cost?\nWhile billions of dollars are being invested in vaccine development, millions more are being pledged to buy and supply the vaccine.\n\nPrices per dose depend on the type of vaccine, the manufacturer and the number of doses ordered. Pharmaceutical company Moderna, for example, is reportedly selling access to its potential vaccine at between $32 and $37 a dose (\u00a324 to \u00a328).\n\nAstraZeneca, on the other hand has said it will supply its vaccine \"at cost\" - or a few dollars per dose - during the pandemic.\n\nThe Serum Institute of India (SSI), the world's largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, is being backed by $150m from Gavi and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to make and deliver up to 100 million doses of the successful Covid-19 vaccines for India and low- and middle-income countries. They say the ceiling price will be $3 (\u00a32.28) a dose.\n\nBut patients receiving the vaccine are unlikely to be charged in most cases.\n\nIn the UK, mass distribution will be via the NHS health service. Student doctors and nurses, dentists and vets could be trained to back up existing NHS staff in administering the jab en masse. Consultation is currently under way.\n\nOther countries, such as Australia, have said they will offer free doses to their population.\n\nPeople receiving vaccines via humanitarian organisations - a vital cog in the global distribution wheel - will not be charged.\n\nIn the US, while the shot might be free, healthcare professionals could charge for administering the jab - leaving uninsured Americans possibly facing a vaccine bill.\n\nSo who gets it first?\nAlthough the pharmaceutical companies will be making the vaccine, they won't be the ones who decide who gets vaccinated first. \"Each organisation or country will have to determine who it immunises first and how it does that,\" Sir Mene Pangalos - AstraZeneca's Executive Vice President told the BBC.\n\nAs the initial supply will be limited, reducing deaths and protecting health care systems are likely to be prioritised.\n\nThe Gavi plan is that countries signed up to Covax, high or low income alike, will receive enough doses for 3% of their population - which would be enough to cover health and social care workers.\n\nAs more vaccine is produced, allocation is increased to cover 20% of the population - this time prioritising over 65s and other vulnerable groups.\n\nAfter everybody has received 20%, the vaccine would be distributed according to other criteria, such as country vulnerability and immediate threat of Covid-19. Countries have until 18 September to commit to the programme and make their upfront payments by 9 October. Negotiations are still under way for many other elements of the allocation process.\n\n\"The only certainty is that there won't be enough - the rest is still up in the air,\" says Dr Simao.\n\nGavi insists richer participants can request enough doses to vaccinate between 10-50% of their population, but no country will receive enough doses to vaccinate more than 20% until all countries in the group have been offered this amount.\n\nDr Berkley says a small buffer of about 5% of the total number of available doses will be kept aside, \"to build a stockpile to help with acute outbreaks and to support humanitarian organisations, for example to vaccinate refugees who may not otherwise have access\".\n\nHow do you distribute a global vaccine? A lot depends on which vaccine is successful.\n\nThe ideal vaccine has a lot to live up to. It needs to be affordable. It needs to generate strong, long-lasting immunity. It needs a simple refrigerated distribution system and manufacturers must be able to scale-up production rapidly.\n\nThe WHO, UNICEF and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MFS / Doctors Without Borders), already have effective vaccination programmes in place around the world with the so called \"cold chain\" facilities - cooler trucks and solar fridges to keep vaccines at the right temperature as they travel from factory to field.\n\nWorld vaccine delivery 'will need 8,000 jumbo jets'\nBut adding a new vaccine to the mix could pose huge logistical problems for those already facing a difficult environment.\n\nVaccines usually need to be kept refrigerated - usually between 2C and 8C.\n\nThat's not too much of a challenge in most developed countries, but can be an \"immense task\" where infrastructure is weak and electricity supply and refrigeration unstable.\n\n\"Maintaining vaccines under cold chain is already one of the biggest challenges' countries face and this will be exacerbated with the introduction of a new vaccine,\" MSF medical adviser Barbara Saitta told the BBC.\n\n\"You will need to add more cold chain equipment, make sure you always have fuel (to run freezer and refrigerators in absence of electricity) and repair/replace them when they break and transport them wherever you need them.\" AstraZeneca has suggested their vaccine would need the regular cold chain between 2C and 8C.\n\nBut it looks like some candidate vaccines will need ultra-cold chain - storage at -60C or colder before being diluted and distributed.\n\n\"To keep the Ebola vaccine at -60\u00b0C or colder we had to use a special cold chain equipment to store and transport them, plus we had to train staff to use all this new equipment,\" said Barbara Saitta.\n\nThere is also the question of the target population. Vaccination programmes usually target children, so agencies will have to plan how to reach people that normally are not part of the immunization program.\n\nAs the world waits for the scientists to do their bit, many more challenges await. And vaccines are not the only weapon against coronavirus.\n\n\"Vaccines are not the only solution,\" Says Dr Simao, of the WHO. \"You need to have diagnostics. You need to have a way to decrease mortality, so you need therapeutics, and you need a vaccine.\n\n\"Besides that, you need everything else - social distancing, avoiding crowded places and so on.\"",

            "Text": "Bah humbug! Is Christmas really going to be cancelled?\n\nThat was the question on Wednesday, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson set out a new \"rule of six\" in England, restricting gatherings to a maximum of six people from Monday.\n\nScotland later announced it was following suit. Wales and Northern Ireland have also tightened restrictions.\n\nWhat are the rules in each of the nations?\nThe new rules in Scotland\nWhat powers do police have?\nMr Johnson said it was \"too early to say\" if big parties could be held over Christmas. And when asked whether families would be able to celebrate together during the winter break, Health Secretary Matt Hancock replied: \"Not necessarily.\"\n\nSo if the latest restrictions stay in place, how could Christmas be different this year? 1. The big day - and the big dinner\nUnder the new guidance, there will be a limit of six people from multiple households at social gatherings in England, and six people from two households in Scotland. There are some exceptions, but a family of five, for example, could be left with an awkward decision: do we invite grandma or granddad?\n\nEither way, the rules mean there will be fewer places at the table for the all-important Christmas dinner - though there might be more turkey to go around. But then it's a guessing game for turkey farmers. Nick and Maria Davis, from Usk Vale Poultry in south Wales, normally raise 70,000 turkeys for Christmas, but have cut back by about 20% for 2020 due to the uncertainty.\n\n\"The run-up to Christmas is going to be a nightmare,\" said Nick, adding: \"It's no fun for a turkey farmer at the best of times but this year we really are on tenterhooks - it's a lucky turkey producer that gets this Christmas right rather than a clever one.\"\n\n2. The Christmas 'do'\nAnnual office Christmas parties, Boxing Day turkey curry buffets, and pre-Christmas dinners with friends will also be subject to the \"rule of six\" - both in private homes and hospitality venues.\n\nVenues following the government's Covid-secure guidelines will be allowed to host more than six people in total, but no one should visit in a group of greater than six.\n\nSo, it will be strict guest lists only for Christmas 2020 parties. Of course, not everyone will be disappointed by the thought they may be excluded from the work Christmas bash...\n\nAnother pre-Christmas staple, for parents of young children at least, is the school nativity play. They could be on the calendar in England, provided the events can be put on in line with the government's rules for performing arts.\n\n3. Christmas Eve in the pub\nThe annual Christmas Eve trip to the pub to catch up with old friends and family also hangs in the balance.\n\nIndustry experts have warned of decreased trading levels in pubs after the latest restrictions, so it seems unlikely large crowds will be spilling out of the local pub, like they usually do during the party season. Pubs will continue to implement guidelines \"to guarantee their customers can safely enjoy the unique and warm atmosphere that only a pub can offer\", said Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association.\n\nBut \"inevitably the announcement [on Wednesday] will cool public confidence to go and visit the pub, which will hit trading levels\".\n\n4. Midnight Mass\nElsewhere, places of worship may remain open - but with a limit of six people attending per group, according to the new guidelines for England. There are also exceptions for places of worship in Scotland.\n\nThat means midnight Mass, Christmas Day Mass and Christingle services should be able to go ahead, but without the congregation singing.\n\nAt the service, the current rules say people should avoid social interaction with anyone outside the group they are with, even if they see other people they know.\n\n\"I welcome confirmation from the prime minister that places of worship can still hold more than six people in total,\" the bishop of London, Sarah Mullally, said.\n\n\"We will continue to work with the government on specific areas relating to our churches and church-based activities.\"\n\n5. Pantomimes\nSadly, it might be more a case of \"oh no, he isn't\", when it comes to the Christmas panto this year.\n\nOngoing uncertainty over when theatres can fully reopen to audiences has already prompted many venues and production companies to cancel their 2020 shows. People are allowed to attend indoor and outdoor performances in England, but theatres are still subject to social distancing guidelines. Theatres have yet to reopen in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nRichard Hughes, chief executive of the Awen Cultural Trust, which runs venues in Wales including the Grand Pavilion in Porthcawl, has said while it was a \"sad time\" for theatre, \"we understand why this has got to happen\".\n\n\"Going forward it is the uncertainty that is difficult to deal with. There is still no light at the end of the tunnel as to when theatres might return, let alone return without social distancing.\"\n\n6. Shopping\nCoronavirus restrictions will change the way we do our Christmas shopping. In short, there is sure to be more clicking and less charging around shops this year.\n\n\"It's going to be a very digital Christmas,\" said Natalie Berg, retail analyst at NBK Retail. She said how, when and what people buy this year would be \"fundamentally different\".\n\nRetailers like Amazon would continue to \"scoop up\" trade this Christmas, she said. Their biggest challenge would be ensuring they have enough capacity to fulfil the \"tsunami\" of online orders.\n\nIn terms of shopping in store, the general expectation was that footfall would be down year on year, she said. But when shoppers do go out they are \"definitely spending\".\n\n\"Consumer demands haven't disappeared, they've just shifted. Skipping the turkey but splashing out on Christmas decorations for the home would be a very 2020 thing to do.\" 7. New Year's Eve\nAnd, after all that Christmas cheer, what about New Year's Eve?\n\nWell, some events have already been impacted by the restrictions. Tickets for Edinburgh's Hogmanay Street Party were withdrawn from sale in July, with organisers saying the event could not go ahead in the usual way.\n\nBut parties at homes and venues could still be enjoyed - but only in groups of six, should the restrictions still be in place in England and Scotland.",

            "Text": "People in the UK must not treat this weekend as a \"party\" before the new \"rule of six\" coronavirus restrictions come into force on Monday, a police union has warned.\n\nThe Police Federation said there was a \"real risk\" that the public would \"take advantage of the current situation\".\n\nThe new rules limit gatherings to six people indoors and outdoors in England.\n\nIt comes as one scientist warned the UK was \"on the edge of losing control\" of the virus.\n\nEngland's new rule of six applies to all ages, although there are some exemptions, such as gatherings for work. Those who fail to follow the new rules can be fined by police - \u00a3100 for a first offence, doubling on each further offence up to \u00a33,200.\n\nIn Scotland, socialising will be limited to a maximum of six people inside and outside - but unlike England they must be from two households, and children under 12 are exempt.\n\nIn Wales, also from Monday, it will be illegal for more than six people from an extended household to meet indoors - but up to 30 can still meet outdoors. In Northern Ireland last month, meanwhile, the number of people who could gather indoors in a private home was reduced from 10 people from four households to six people from two households.\n\n'Incredibly irresponsible'\nWith the introduction of the new rules in England and Wales delayed until Monday, John Apter, the chairman of the Police Federation for England and Wales, said: \"There is a real risk some members of the public will take advantage of the current situation and treat this weekend as a party weekend ahead of the tighter restrictions being introduced on Monday.\n\n\"Using the current situation as an opportunity and excuse to party would be incredibly irresponsible and put pressure not only on policing, but potentially on the ambulance service and NHS.\"\n\nWhat are the new rules for meeting my friends?\nHow many cases are there in your area?\nWhich areas are under local lockdown?\nTim Robson, the North East's representative on the National Pubwatch scheme, said he expected police officers would strictly monitor bars over the weekend to ensure they are operating safely.\n\n\"There is an anticipation that everyone is going to have a big last binge, but people are starting to get fearful and a lot of licensed premises have already been clamped down on by the police,\" he said.\n\nMr Robson, a former police officer, said it would be up to licensees to manage their premises and break up large groups from gathering together unsafely. On Saturday, the government announced there were a further 3,497 coronavirus cases in the UK.\n\nIn Scotland, daily coronavirus cases have hit a four-month high, with a total of 221 people testing positive for the virus in the past 24 hours - the highest daily figure since May 8.\n\nThe virus is still at much lower levels across the UK than at the peak in April, but a study of thousands of people in England found cases are doubling every seven to eight days.\n\nProf Sir Mark Walport, a member of the government's Sage scientific advisory group, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"One would have to say that we're on the edge of losing control.\n\n\"You've only got to look across the Channel to see what is happening in France and what's happening in Spain.\"\n\nIt comes as the final clinical trials for a vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, are set to resume. They were put on hold last weekend after a participant became unwell.\n\nThe AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine - in which 18,000 people from around the world are taking part - is seen as a strong contender among dozens being developed globally. Meanwhile, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the rule of six was \"well-understood\" as a public health message and had the public's support.\n\n\"As ever, the important thing is balance - eating out, seeing friends - that is fine, provided we do so in a way that is socially responsible, that's what the rule of six is about,\" he told the BBC.\n\nHe added that there needed to be \"a degree of self-discipline and restriction\" in order to deal with the challenges posed by the rising number of coronavirus cases across England - and the escalating R number, which measures the rate at which the virus is transmitted.\n\nHowever, Mr Gove also conceded fines could be necessary to enforce regulations.\n\n\"I don't want to see fines being levied, but even more I do not want to see people behaving in a way that puts the most vulnerable at risk,\" he said.\n\nBehind the rise in Covid cases in five charts\nHow close to developing a vaccine are we? The R number has been raised to between 1 and 1.2 for the first time since March. Any number above one indicates the number of infections is increasing.\n\nAnd in addition to a general rise in cases in the community, the government's latest coronavirus surveillance report shows a sharp rise in people over the age of 85 testing positive.\n\nAsked about Prof Walport's statement that the UK was \"losing control\", Mr Gove said it was \"a warning to us all\".\n\n\"There's a range of scientific opinion but one thing on which practically every scientist is agreed is that we have seen an uptick in infection and therefore it is appropriate we take public health measures.\" t comes after people across England told BBC News they are struggling to access coronavirus tests.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said last week that no-one should have to travel more than 75 miles for a test, after the BBC revealed some were being sent hundreds of miles away.\n\nBut some have now reported being unable to book a swab at all.\n\nThe Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) said testing capacity was targeted at the hardest-hit areas",

Coronavirus testing system 'falling over'\nPeople across England say they are still struggling to get coronavirus tests, despite Health Secretary Matt Hancock saying no-one should travel more than 75 miles to access one. Postcodes entered into the government's booking system return a message suggesting there are no testing centres of home kits available - even for essential workers who have symptoms.

Dentists 'firefighting' to deal with backlog\nDentists are \"firefighting\" to deal with a \"huge backlog\" and will not catch up until 2021, the Welsh general practitioners committee chairman has said. Untreated fillings could make teeth irreparable with signs of mouth cancer not being picked up, Tom Bysouth added. 3.

How does the pandemic affect pregnancy, scans and birth?\n\n4. Lockdown again: 'It can't get any worse'\nJust two months after pubs and restaurants in England were allowed to reopen, local lockdowns have forced many to close their doors once again.

            "Text": "Imagine being in your classroom, aged seven, with your teacher being beamed in from her home by video-link.\n\nAt Heathfield Primary in Darlington that's exactly what's happening.\n\nMrs Craghill is teaching her class of seven- and eight-year-olds by video-link. Someone in her household tested positive for the virus, so she is having to self-isolate - but her lessons continue.\n\nWhat must schools do if children get coronavirus\nCoronavirus: Saliva test study will track school cases\nDarlington, unlike some other towns in north-east England, has a relatively low transmission rate of coronavirus - but even here, schools are having to be resourceful and vigilant to ensure children can at last pick up their education after months of disruption.\n\nSnap research by the BBC late last week showed hundreds of pupils were having to self isolate when small numbers of their classmates, in schools across England, showed symptoms of the virus.\n\nThis is of course a tiny proportion out of the millions of pupils in England's 27,000 schools - but it just shows how vigilant school communities have to be in order to contain the virus. For Mrs Craghill, this is not the way she wanted to start the school year, but at least the video-link ensures she can have some contact with pupils who have been out of school for so long. \"It's been really beneficial for myself and the children to be able to have some connection each day and just to connect with maths and English and to see their faces really and for them to see me.\"\n\n'Face-to-face'\nAt Heathfield, children are having recovery classes and lessons in mindfulness to help them adjust after missing months of schooling\n\n\"So I liked being back at school to be with my friends and have education, like really good education, like face to face,\" Lucas told the BBC.\n\n\"I like being back at school with a team of friends and because if I'm struggling the teacher can help me because I couldn't do that at home,\" a classmate added. Lingfield Educational Trust, which runs this primary and six others in north-east England, says schools are a safe place.\n\nBut its chief executive Nick Blackburn says it's been a \"challenging\" first week back,\n\n\"In this school, 20 pupils have been sent home whilst we're waiting for a test result,\" Mr Blackburn told the BBC.\n\nAnother primary, run by the same trust in nearby Middlesbrough, has had to close the reception class and the nursery class.\n\n\"We're going to see this, unfortunately, again and again.\" Mr Blackburn added. He said Middlesbrough, if not Darlington, is in a part of the country where infection rates are higher than some other areas.\n\nCleaning costs\nSocial distancing and hygiene are now important parts of the school day, putting pressure on time and budgets.\n\nPaying out for more cleaning materials, is one issue, according to Heathfield head teacher, Helen Tarokh.\n\n\"But also there's some staffing costs as well,\" she added.\n\n\"Health and safety has just taken over my life as a head teacher at the moment, which is nobody's fault - that's the situation that we're in, but it's frustrating because we want to be getting on with our usual day job of making sure that we do teaching and learning really well.\" If there is a suspected or confirmed case of coronavirus, schools have to get in touch with their local public health teams.\n\nParent Clare Langford has two children at the school. At the moment, her son is going in - but her daughter's class has been sent home to self-isolate.\n\n\"She's asymptomatic which is great,\" says Claire. \"You know, I'm very happy about that - but should she get symptoms, my concern is that because my elder son is still in school, obviously if my daughter gets symptoms and does get Covid, that my son will get it and he will have moved it to Year 6.\n\nThe vast majority of children across the UK are now back in lessons - but staff and pupils are all learning to deal with disruption - the new reality of being back at school as the pandemic continues.",

            "HeadLine": "Coronavirus doctor's diary: Will universities be able to avoid spreading the virus?",
            "Text": "A great migration is under way. Children have returned to school and students are beginning to leave for university. Will the UK be able to avoid the outbreaks experienced at some US universities, asks Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary.\n\nIn the hospital we continue to see small numbers of patients with Covid-19. We walk a tightrope of preparing for the autumn surge while trying to get all our normal clinical care waiting lists back to pre-pandemic levels. The lull in acute cases provides a tense truce. In the empty visitors' car parks discarded facemasks are the new tumbleweed.\n\nMeanwhile in the city the fever is rising. Every day the coronavirus needle flickers upwards; it's tempting to tap the dial in the hope that is just a malfunction. By Friday the incidence rate has crept up towards 80 per 100,000 and the case positivity rate towards 8%, from less than 50 per 100,000 and 5% just two weeks ago.\n\nAnd this is happening in the middle of the largest population movement seen since the start of the pandemic in March. Last week eight million children and young people returned cautiously to school - it will be a couple of weeks before we have an accurate picture of how many outbreaks are occurring in the classroom. Universities will be next over the trenches. Next week about two million students will start back at university - young people with some of the highest rates of Covid-19, and they will come from all over the country to congregate in large numbers in university cities and campuses. They will both give and take SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIn the US, where students went back after their summer vacation last month, this has caused serious problems. The New York Times has counted tens of thousands of new cases at colleges and universities in the last few weeks. So how has the University of Bradford been preparing for the start of term?\n\nVice Chancellor Prof Shirley Congdon tells me about 60% or 70% of the curriculum will be taught online, the rest will be face-to-face. Where students need to assemble, for laboratory work for example, an attempt will be made to keep them in small bubbles - though as the vice chancellor points out, different students choose different modules, so bubbles will inevitably overlap.\n\nFreshers' week is going to look very different this year, and not just because of the masks, thermometers and guidance pamphlets that each new student will receive in a welcome pack.\n\n\"The Students' Union is working with us to do activities where we can have groups where 20 or 30 students maximum experience a campus activity. And then that will be repeated again at a different time of the day or week,\" Shirley Congdon says.\n\nBut when it comes to socialising, she accepts that students are going to do their own thing.\n\n\"We don't want to enforce a police state, nor could we,\" she says. \"So what we're trying to do with students and our staff is really create a big community that understands the importance of following social distancing, making sure that we all understand the risks.\"\n\nThe university is ready for test and trace, following guidance from Public Health England. It would be great if the university could carry out tests itself, Shirley Congdon says, \"but that's not been offered to us yet\". Prof John Wright, a doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research, and a veteran of cholera, HIV and Ebola epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. He is writing this diary for BBC News and recording from the hospital wards for BBC Radio.\n\nListen to the next episode of The NHS Front Line on BBC Sounds or the BBC World Service\nOr read the previous online diary entry: The 'moonshine weddings' breaking Bradford's lockdown\nAs many of the positive cases now being detected are among young people with mild or no symptoms, the eyes of the nation are glaring down at them as they revel in the joy and freedom of youth.\n\nIt seems unfair to blame them, though, when we are giving out such mixed messages. Go to the pub, eat out to help out, go to university. But keep your distance, don't mingle, stay home when you can.\n\nMark Mon-Williams, a professor of psychology at the University of Leeds and the Bradford Institute of Health Research, makes the point that it's unrealistic to expect young people not to socialise, and that this is a time when it's important for their personal development to meet new people.\n\n\"So I think we really should think seriously about how we can support young people to have those social interactions, while maintaining the overall safety of the population,\" he says.\n\nIn his view, viral transmission on campus, under the new teaching regimes that have been introduced at British universities, is likely to be less of a problem than in student accommodation. In the US, according to an editorial in the British Medical Journal, asymptomatic students infected one another \"at lightning speed\" in halls of residence and off-campus housing. A fellow psychologist at Indiana University in the US tells Prof Mon-Williams that all teaching has now gone online, the campus is deserted and that some fraternities and sororities (male and female societies with their own residential buildings) have infection rates of 80%.\n\nLike most other northern universities, the University of Bradford stands proudly at the heart of the city, surrounded by inner city wards. It is in these wards that we are seeing by far the highest levels of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, and in these wards where most of the student accommodation lies waiting - bare walls waiting to be decorated with student posters, silent corridors waiting to be filled with laughter and late-night conversations that will put the world to rights.\n\nEthan Chapman, 19, who is returning to Bradford from his home in Lancaster for the second year of a course in Paramedic Science, says it's difficult to predict how the pandemic will affect his course and his social life. \"In relation to parties, the school leavers will miss an opportunity,\" he thinks. \"It's hard to know if people will still party, especially with Bradford being such a hotspot.\"\n\nHe expects students will be urged to stay within the bubbles that they find themselves in, through sharing kitchens and bathrooms in halls, or shared houses. But some people won't enjoy having their social life curtailed in this way, he predicts, and will want to socialise with a wider group.\n\nThough he was pulled off a placement working with qualified paramedics at the start of the pandemic, he is expecting to be equipped with a fitted mask and other PPE, and for placements this year to go ahead.\n\nAn added challenge in Bradford is that many students - about half of the total - live at home, with the consequent risk that they will carry the virus to older and more vulnerable family members. In Britain, in the academic year 2017-18, just over 80% of full-time students left home to study - roughly half living in purpose-built halls and the rest in private rented accommodation\n\nIn 2015/6 the University of Bradford was one of 10 British universities where more than 50% of students lived at home\n\nOn average in Europe, 36% of students live in their parental home\n\nThere are also students such as Marium Zumeer, whom I wrote about in May after her recovery from Covid-19, who has a place at Leeds Beckett university, and will continue living at home in Bradford if she decides to accept it. Her sister, Hana. is already at the same university.\n\nMarium knows only too well how serious this illness can be, having been very ill herself, and having lost her grandfather, Mohammed, in the pandemic. She wears a mask, she carries hand sanitiser, and whenever she returns home she changes her clothes.\n\n\"University is about meeting new people, socialising and making friends and joining groups, though when meeting new people you don't know if they've got the virus. It will worry me a bit,\" she says.\n\n\"I chose a university that's close to home because I prefer staying at home, that's just a personal choice, but for those who are living at home they have to be more mature about staying safe.\"",

Across different countries and within most countries, results show that those who are most systemically disadvantaged have been hit the hardest.\"\n\nAn unequal world\nThe pandemic has had a more severe impact on people in poorer countries and has exacerbated existing inequalities, the poll found.\n\nThere was a notable divide between countries among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and non-member countries. The OECD is an international group of 37 countries that are among the world's most prosperous economies. The poll shows that 69% of people in non-OECD countries had their income affected due to the pandemic, compared to 45% of those living in OECD countries.\n\nOverall, the research found that people in Latin America, Asia and Africa were more likely to say the virus had had a considerable impact on them than those living in Europe and North America.\n\nPeople in Kenya (91%), Thailand (81%), Nigeria (80%), South Africa (77%), Indonesia (76%), and Vietnam (74%) were most likely to have been affected financially. People on low incomes in those countries were most likely to say they now had even less money.\n\nBut counter-intuitively, people with high incomes in Australia, Canada, Japan, Russia, and the UK were more likely to have been impacted financially by the pandemic than those earning the least.\n\nA generational divide\nThe pandemic has opened up a gulf between young and old, according to the poll.\n\nYounger generations say they have experienced a tougher time than older generations. This might be because there have been fewer opportunities to work, socialise and seek education during the pandemic. Some 55% of respondents from Gen Z (people born between the mid-1990s and early 2010s) and 56% of Millennials (people born between the early 1980s and mid-1990s) feel the pandemic has greatly affected their lives.\n\nIn contrast, only 49% of those from Gen X (people born from 1965 to 1980) and 39% of Baby Boomers (people born from 1946 to 1964) said they felt the same.\n\n'It's unfair to blame young people for virus rise'\nYoung hit hardest by lockdown financial squeeze\nGen Z respondents suffered the worst financial hit, with 63% saying they saw a change to their incomes. Conversely, only 42% of Baby Boomers said their incomes were affected.\n\nOlder generations are also more likely to have escaped physical or financial harm. Some 56% of Baby Boomers and older reported no physical or financial impacts, compared to 39% on average globally.\n\nOther key findings from the poll include:\n\nNearly six in 10 people (57%) say they have been affected financially by the pandemic\nWomen say they are facing a greater financial impact than men. The greatest disparities were reported in Germany (32% of women versus 24% of men), Italy (50% versus 43%), and the UK (45% versus 38%).\nIn the US, 14% of black Americans say they or a family member have been infected with Covid-19, compared with 7% of white Americans\nParents felt greater impacts from the pandemic, with 57% telling pollsters they have been greatly affected, versus 41% of people without children",

            "Text": "Six months since the coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic, false claims continue to circulate on social media.\n\nHere's our latest round-up of some of the most widely shared.\n\nClaim: Test kits for 'Covid-19' were being exported before the outbreak\nVerdict: A database of worldwide shipments of chemical supplies created in 2020, but going back to 2015, did refer to their use for \"Covid-19 kits\". The World Bank, one of the international organisations responsible for maintaining the list, says this was because these previously existing products are now being used for Covid-19 testing. The website has now been changed and a clarification issued. The claim on social media - a persistent one among conspiracy theorists - is that this is evidence the pandemic was planned all along, and the World Bank knew about it. This is false and we can settle any doubts about what's going on.\n\nThe screenshot being shared is genuine and includes trade information under the heading \"COVID-19 Test kits exports by country in 2017\". Other pages show earlier years with similar data. So you can understand why this might have caused some confusion. According to the World Bank, the page was created in April 2020 to make it easier to find all of the previously existing products that are now being used for Covid-19 testing.\n\nAll the chemical products listed on the site have had other uses for many years, but the World Bank says they were re-categorised to ease the tracking of items that are particularly important to tackle the coronavirus.\n\nFrom 7 September the title of the database was changed to \"medical test kits\", and to avoid further misunderstanding includes a disclaimer that says \"the data here track previously existing medical devices that are now classified by the World Customs Organization as critical to tackling Covid-19.\"\n\nThe claims of a conspiracy seem to have emerged on social media late last week and have since spread across multiple platforms and languages.\n\nAlthough the allegations appeared on Twitter and Facebook almost simultaneously, they only gained traction after a UK-based user on Facebook published a video pointing out the alleged discrepancy in the test kit data on 5 September.\n\nLinks and screenshots of the database then spread more widely on Facebook and Twitter, and also appeared on Reddit, Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nThe claims have also crossed over into other languages, including Dutch, Italian, German, Polish, Spanish, Arabic, Portuguese and Hebrew. Claim: Infrared thermometers harm the brain\nVerdict: False. These devices are not dangerous.\n\nThe sight of someone having their temperature checked using a thermometer pointed at the forehead is fairly common these days.\n\nThese thermometers record a person's temperature by measuring infrared radiation from the surface of the body.\n\nA high temperature is an indication of possible coronavirus infection.\n\nA video posted on YouTube with 2 million views falsely claims this process is dangerous. It is not and there's a simple explanation why. The thermometer records the infrared radiation coming off the body - the surfaces of all objects emit this type of radiation - but nothing is fired at the person.\n\nThe man presenting the video describes the concerns of an unnamed \"Australian nurse\", and refers specifically to the potential harm done to the pineal gland.\n\nThis is deep inside the brain and controls a hormone called melatonin. The man calls it the \"gateway to the spirit realm\".\n\nBut there's no way the pineal gland would be harmed or could be \"targeted\" by a thermometer.\n\n\"They just pick up your infrared radiation. They're not shooting anything,\" says Stafford Lightman, a professor of medicine at Bristol University.\n\nAs for the claim that it's safer and more effective to measure temperature at the wrist, Prof Lightman says it isn't.\n\nHe explains that your limbs get cold and the blood supply to the wrists - unlike to the face - can be quite variable so it isn't a good place to take a temperature.\n\nClaim: Eating llama meat can help fight coronavirus\nVerdict: There is no scientific evidence to support this claim.\n\nIneffective and unproven Covid-19 treatments have been touted online since the beginning of the pandemic, and in some cases, they've even been promoted by leading politicians.\n\nThis one however is new to us. One of Peru's regional governors has suggested that eating llama and alpaca meat could help fight off coronavirus. According to a Peruvian radio station, the governor cited studies indicating that llamas and alpacas carry antibodies which could potentially be modified to develop a Covid-19 treatment.\n\nThe BBC science team reported on this research a while back, but these studies do not conclude that eating the animals' meat could help a person combat the virus. Scientists instead found that the llama's antibodies could possibly be adapted to make a therapy for humans.\n\nSo far, the only drugs that have been proven to save lives in clinical trials are dexamethasone and hydrocortisone.\n\nClaim: A homeopathic medicine, arsenicum album, can help prevent coronavirus\nVerdict: There is no scientific evidence to support the use of this homeopathic medicine to protect against Covid-19.\n\nIndia's ministry for alternative medicine, Ayush, has promoted the use of a homeopathic medicine, arsenicum album-30, claiming it can help prevent people from contracting coronavirus.\n\nThere are however no peer-reviewed scientific studies supporting its use as a preventative treatment for Covid-19. Recently, the Indian PTI news agency reported that the western state of Gujarat had distributed the medicine to more than half of the state's population as a preventative treatment.\n\nA top health official in the state said she believed in \"some effectiveness\" of the medicine against coronavirus, but admitted that \"to actually establish this, we need more rigorous analysis\".\n\nThere is no evidence that the medicine is effective, either in the prevention or treatment of Covid-19.

            "HeadLine": "Coronavirus: Concerns over Boris Johnson's 'moonshot' testing plans",
            "Text": "Scientists and health professionals have raised doubts about Prime Minister Boris Johnson's \"Operation Moonshot\" plan for mass coronavirus testing.\n\nThe PM hopes millions of Covid-19 tests - including some giving results within minutes - could be processed daily.\n\nBut experts say there are issues with laboratory capacity for current tests, while the technology for more rapid tests \"does not, as yet, exist\".\n\nThe British Medical Journal says leaked memos show the plan could cost \u00a3100bn.\n\nSpeaking after his announcement that gatherings in England are to be restricted to six people from Monday, Mr Johnson said the government was \"working hard\" to increase testing capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of October.\n\nAnd he said that \"in the near future\" he wanted to start using testing \"to identify people who are negative - who don't have coronavirus and who are not infectious - so we can allow them to behave in a more normal way, in the knowledge they cannot infect anyone else\".\n\nWhat are the new rules?\nUK coronavirus cases up by 2,659 on Wednesday\nMr Johnson added: \"We believe that new types of test which are simple, quick and scalable will become available. They use swabs or saliva and can turn round results in 90 or even 20 minutes. \"Crucially, it should be possible to deploy these tests on a far bigger scale than any country has yet achieved - literally millions of tests processed every single day.\"\n\nMr Johnson said a mass-testing programme could be ready by the spring and could help the UK to avoid a second national lockdown. But Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chairman of the British Medical Association, said it was unclear how the so-called Operation Moonshot would work - given the \"huge problems\" currently seen with lab capacity.\n\nDr Nagpaul added the idea of opening up society based on people testing negative for the virus should be \"approached with caution\" because of the high rate of \"false negatives\" and the potential to miss those who are incubating the virus. Many experts believe plans to roll out mass rapid testing this winter is unrealistic. Piloting is still taking place to see if the technologies work - millions of tests would then need to be manufactured and distributed.\n\nThe focus on this \"moonshot\" plan is perhaps a distraction from the difficult decisions the country faces.\n\nThe level of infection is still low - despite the recent rises.\n\nBut do not expect them to stay this way.\n\nRespiratory viruses tend to do better in the autumn and winter because of the colder weather and fact people are indoors more.\n\nMinisters will then face the choice of more restrictions to try to curb the virus in the knowledge these will damage people's health in other ways as well as harming education and the economy.\n\nOr let the virus spread, while focusing efforts on protecting the vulnerable - that means protecting care homes and perhaps reintroducing shielding.\n\nLockdown bought us time, but simply deferred the problem.\n\nProgress has been made in the past six months - there are better treatments, more testing and a network of contact tracers - but perhaps not as much as hoped.\n\nThe UK - like all nations - faces a tricky act of balancing harms.\n\nDr David Strain, clinical senior lecturer at the University of Exeter and chairman of the BMA's medical academic staff committee, said the mass-testing strategy is \"fundamentally flawed\" and is \"based on technology that does not, as yet, exist\".\n\n\"The prime minister's suggestion that this will be as simple as 'getting a pregnancy test' that will give results within 15 minutes is unlikely, if not impossible, in the timescale he was suggesting to get the country back on track.\"\n\nWhile Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at the University of Cambridge, warned it could also lead to false positives - with hundreds of thousands of people being wrongly told they have coronavirus.\n\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries acknowledged that the \"the tricky thing with this is not so much the technology, which I'm sure we will have in the very short while in weeks to months, the issue actually is how it gets used in practice\".\n\n\"So that, if you have, for example, a false negative test, but you feel assured that you don't have the disease, you don't end up going back into the workplace.\" Currently, between 150,000 and 200,000 tests are processed each day.\n\nTesting capacity is reported as being 350,000 a day - and this includes 250,000 swab tests (which check if you have the virus currently) as well as 100,000 antibody tests (which check if someone has already had the virus).\n\nEarlier this week a director of the government's test and trace programme in England issued a \"heartfelt\" apology for problems with the testing system, explaining that laboratories, not the testing sites themselves, were the \"critical pinch-point\".\n\nOne in five with Covid could test negative\nCovid tests 'could be picking up dead virus'\nGovernment apologises over Covid tests shortage\nThe UK has drawn up plans to eventually carry out up to 10 million Covid-19 tests a day by early next year - at a cost of more than \u00a3100bn, which is approaching the entire annual budget for NHS England, according to a report in the BMJ.\n\nThe new rapid tests will be piloted in Salford from next month.\n\nThe government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said the technology needed to be \"tested carefully\" and it would be \"completely wrong to assume this is a slam dunk\".\n\nThe plans for mass testing come as Scotland launched its new contact tracing app, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urging as many people as possible to download it.\n\nThe contact tracing app being developed in England ran into technical problems and is currently being tested following a revamp.\n\n'Rule of six'\nOn Wednesday, Mr Johnson set out a new \"rule of six\" in England, restricting gatherings to a maximum of six people, enforced by police able to issue fines or make arrests, after the UK reported more than 2,000 new coronavirus cases for the fourth consecutive day.\n\n\"If everyone does it [the rule of six], we may well be by Christmas in a position to look at it again,\" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Former government adviser Prof Neil Ferguson said the new measures will take about \"two to three weeks\" to see an effect on the number of cases.\n\n\"So we need to wait at this point and see how much we flatten the curve and then if that's not sufficient to bring the reproduction number below one, so the epidemic starts shrinking again, then yes, we may need to clamp down on other areas,\" he added.\n\nWhile young people are testing positive at higher rates, Prof Ferguson said it was unavoidable that the virus would resurge in all age groups.\n\nAsked about the return to work, he said: \"Certainly I think we should hesitate and maybe pause at the headlong rush to get everybody back into offices. But some people have to work and I completely understand the concerns in many quarters that everybody working at home has an economic impact, particularly on city centres.\" Meanwhile, a new law will also require businesses such as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and cinemas to record customers' contact details.\n\nThe government has also published its coronavirus guidance for universities ahead of students returning later this month, with full online learning only as a last resort.",

Let's look after each other,\" she added.\n\n'Not good news'\nAnd Prof Jason Leitch, Scotland's national clinical director, admitted that 221 positive cases was a \"big number compared to what we have got used to\".\n\n\"As we've opened up it's inevitable the virus has found new ways of getting from household to household - and that's all it wants to do; it wants to find new people to infect,\" he told BBC Scotland.\n\n\"You've seen us take fairly harsh interventions and restrictions to some areas - that won't work instantly. It will need days, weeks, even a number of weeks, to show in the numbers.\n\n\"It's not good news, but it's what we expected.

            "Text": "US President Donald Trump has defended his decision to downplay the risks of Covid-19, saying his answers to journalist Bob Woodward were \"proper\".\n\nWoodward, known for his reporting on the Watergate scandal, interviewed Mr Trump 18 times from December to July.\n\nMr Trump said in February he minimised the virus's severity to avoid panic.\n\nHe tweeted on Thursday that Woodward did not report his quotes for months. \"He knew they were good and proper answers. Calm, no panic!\"\n\nLater he told reporters he never lied, when they suggested he deliberately misled the American public on how dangerous the virus was.\n\nIn a White House news conference on Thursday afternoon, he said in response to a reporter's question: \"I didn't lie, what I said is we have to be calm, we can't be panicked.\"\n\nHe added: \"I don't want to jump up and down and start screaming, 'death, death', because that's not what it's about.\"\n\nSome 190,000 Americans have been recorded as dying with Covid-19 since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nWhat did Trump say?\n\"Bob Woodward had my quotes for many months. If he thought they were so bad or dangerous, why didn't he immediately report them in an effort to save lives?\" Mr Trump said.\n\n\"Didn't he have an obligation to do so? No, because he knew they were good and proper answers. Calm, no panic!\" The president - who is running for re-election in November - on Wednesday told reporters the Woodward book was \"a political hit job\".\n\nWhat has Woodward said?\nWoodward has been criticised for withholding the president's remarks on the pandemic, with some saying it was an unethical decision.\n\nThe journalist offered a defence in the Washington Post and Associated Press on Wednesday, saying he needed to check whether what Mr Trump told him was accurate.\n\n\"The biggest problem I had, which is always a problem with Trump, is I didn't know if it was true,\" Woodward told The Post.\n\nHe also said that it was important for him to tell the story by the election, telling the Associated Press: \"Had I decided that my book was coming out on Christmas, the end of this year, that would have been unthinkable.\"\n\nThe book, Rage, will be released on 15 September.\n\nWhat does the book say about Mr Trump and the virus?\nMr Trump indicated that he knew more about the severity of the illness than he had said publicly.\n\nAccording to a tape of the call, Mr Trump told Woodward in February that the coronavirus was deadlier than the flu.\n\n\"It goes through the air,\" Mr Trump told the author on 7 February.\n\n\"That's always tougher than the touch. You don't have to touch things. Right? But the air, you just breathe the air and that's how it's passed.\n\n\"And so that's a very tricky one. That's a very delicate one. It's also more deadly than even your strenuous flus.\" \n\nLater that month, Mr Trump promised the virus was \"very much under control\", and that the case count would soon be close to zero. He also publicly implied the flu was more dangerous than Covid-19. Speaking on Capitol Hill on 10 March, Mr Trump said: \"Just stay calm. It will go away.\"\n\nFrom 2018: Woodward on Trump - the explosive quotes\nHow Trump's attitude toward coronavirus has shifted\nNine days later, after the White House declared the pandemic a national emergency, the president told Woodward: \"I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic.\"\n\nWhat Trump was telling Woodward v saying publicly\n\n28 Jan: National security adviser Robert O'Brien tells the president: \"This is the biggest national security threat you will face.\"\n\n7 Feb: \"This is deadly stuff,\" he tells Woodward, far more serious than the flu.\n\n23 Feb: \"We have it very much under control,\" President Trump tells reporters.\n\n26 Feb: On the 15 confirmed cases at the time, he tells a briefing: \"within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that's a pretty good job we've done\", implying that flu is far more dangerous.\n\n27 Feb: The virus is going to \"disappear\", he says.\n\n10 March: \"We're doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away,\" the president says on Capitol Hill.\n\n19 March: He tells Woodward he wanted to play it down to avoid a panic.\n\nWhat else did the book reveal?\nOn race\n\nWoodward writes that he brought up the Black Lives Matter protests in a conversation with the president on 19 June, suggesting that \"white, privileged\" people like themselves ought to work to understand how black Americans feel.\n\n\"You really drank the Kool-Aid, didn't you?\" Mr Trump said. \"Just listen to you.\"\n\nThe nationwide protests against police brutality and racism were sparked by George Floyd's death in Minnesota in May.\n\nMr Trump also repeated the suggestion that he had done more for African Americans than any president aside from Abraham Lincoln, who abolished slavery.\n\nLater, on 8 July, Mr Trump again reiterated that he had \"done a tremendous amount for the black community\" but was \"not feeling any love\".\n\nThe Washington Post also cited an interview where Woodward asked the president about whether America has systemic racism.\n\nMr Trump said while these problems exist everywhere, \"I think probably less here than most places, or less here than many places\".\n\nThe president also acknowledged racism affected the lives of people in the US, saying it was \"unfortunate\".\n\nOn North Korea\n\nWoodward's book also cites dozens of letters between Mr Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un. In the letters, filled with flowery language, Mr Kim reportedly referred to Mr Trump as \"Your Excellency\" and noted their \"deep and special friendship will work as a magical force\".\n\nAccording to US media, Mr Trump told Woodward of his connection with Mr Kim: \"You meet a woman. In one second, you know whether or not it's going to happen. It doesn't take you 10 minutes and it doesn't take you six weeks. It's like, whoa. OK. You know? It takes somewhat less than a second.\"\n\nIn a tweet on Thursday, Mr Trump wrote: \"Kim Jong Un is in good health. Never underestimate him!\" There have been sporadic reports about Mr Kim's health, including one in April that he was seriously ill or even dead.\n\nOn new weapons\n\nThe president also reportedly told Woodward about nuclear weapons systems in his conversations about North Korea. Other sources also confirmed the existence of a new weapons system, Woodward reported.\n\n\"I have built a nuclear - a weapons system that nobody's ever had in this country before. We have stuff that you haven't even seen or heard about,\" he said, according to the Post.\n\n\"We have stuff that [Russian President] Putin and [Chinese President] Xi have never heard about before,\" Trump added.\n\nOn his predecessors\n\nMr Trump also reportedly told Woodward that he felt his predecessor, Barack Obama, was \"highly overrated\".\n\n\"I don't think Obama's smart,\" Mr Trump reportedly said. \"And I don't think he's a great speaker.\"\n\nAccording to CNN, Mr Trump told Woodward he made President George W Bush \"look like a stupid moron, which he was\".",

The rapid flow of data and information, to and from care providers, is vital to this effort.\"\n\nMr Miller said the infections were detected chiefly among staff but had been transmitted to residents in some cases. He went on to stress \"the importance of regular testing and consistent use of PPE\".\n\n'Looking over our shoulder'\nSpeaking to the BBC, social care provider Mike Padgham - who runs four care homes in North Yorkshire - said the letter \"doesn't tell us anything we didn't know already\".\n\nHe said there were currently no cases of coronavirus in any of his care homes, but called for clarity around visiting, as the R rate - the reproduction rate of Covid-19 - has recently increased.\n\n\"At present, things are fairly calm, but we are looking over our shoulder at what is coming next,\" he said.\n\nMr Padgham, regional chair of the Independent Care Group, said one of his homes had reopened to visitors only last week for the first time since March, but since receiving the letter, he was now wondering if visits were a good idea.\n\nHe said his \"natural instinct was to allow visits\" - in keeping with families' wishes - but added he \"would like more guidance\".\n\n\"You're damned if you do, damned if you don't\u2026\" he added.

A DHSC spokeswoman said: \"Throughout our coronavirus response we have been doing everything we can to ensure all staff and residents in care homes are protected.\n\n\"We are testing all residents and staff, have provided 200 million items of PPE and ring-fenced \u00a3600m to prevent infections in care homes, with a further \u00a33.7bn available to councils to address pressures caused by the pandemic, including in adult social care.\n\n\"There is a high demand for tests and our laboratories continue to turn test results around as quickly as possible and we plan to rapidly expand it in the coming weeks as well as bringing in new technology to process tests faster.\"",

            "Text": "(CNN)New coronavirus cases are down across the US about 12% on average over the last seven days compared to the previous week, but the nation is still averaging more than 900 deaths a day.\n\nAccording to an analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University, cases are steadily declining in states hard-hit by Covid-19. Compared to last week, new cases are down in Arizona about 36%, California and Texas have seen a decrease of 29%, and Florida's numbers are down 26%. But new cases are rising across the Midwest, including in Indiana, Iowa, Kansas and North Dakota, each of which is experiencing its peak seven-day average for daily new cases.\nNorth Dakota claimed the mantle of the state with the highest per capita rate of new cases in the US with a seven-day average of 28.10 new cases per 100,000. Iowa and Kansas both saw record highs Wednesday for new cases reported.\nAlso on Wednesday, the US reported 44,109 cases and 1,222 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins.\nThe number of deaths related to the coronavirus in the US topped 180,000 on Thursday, according to the JHU data. More than 5.8 million cases have been reported.\nPandemic response complicated by Hurricane Laura\nStates hit hard by Covid-19 like Texas and Louisiana are dealing with another threat: Hurricane Laura made landfall overnight as a Category 4 storm with 150 mph winds. Each crisis has complicated the states' responses to the other.\nAhead of the storm, some Covid-19 testing sites were closed and efforts paused, likely hampering data collection in the coming days. But the pandemic also hobbled evacuation efforts as residents were worried about seeking refuge in shelters filled with large groups of people. \"We heard that early on from a lot of people, they were fearful of being put into a large shelter,\" Louisiana Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser told CNN Thursday morning. So instead, people were sheltered in hotels, Nungesser said, where they could remain safely isolated away from other families.\n\"I think that was a wise move at FEMA to support those moves to hotels instead of large shelters,\" Nungesser said. \"It helped a lot of people make the decision to get out.\"\nLooking ahead, Nungesser said that the pandemic will also complicate relief efforts, particularly for residents who might have been displaced by the storm. \"We are still dealing with the Covid-19 so finding housing for people is going to be a challenge,\" Nungesser said.\nMeantime, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said his state was also relying on new evacuation strategies that were tested last month by Hurricane Hanna, which brought heavy rains to southern Texas.\nAs many residents as possible were evacuated to hotels, Abbott said, instead of large spaces like convention centers.\n\"It worked every well in the aftermath of Hurricane Hanna because several weeks after ... the number of people testing positive for Covid-19 and the hospitalizations for Covid-19 actually declined,\" he said. New CDC testing guidelines perplex doctors\nUpdated guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week says some people without Covid-19 symptoms may not need to be tested, even if they've been in close contact with someone who has a confirmed case.\nThe CDC previously said testing was appropriate for people with recent or suspected exposure, even if they were asymptomatic. The new guidance raised eyebrows among doctors who told CNN it didn't make sense.\n\"These are exactly the people who should be tested,\" said Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University and former Baltimore health commissioner.\n\"I'm concerned that these recommendations suggest someone who has had substantial exposure to a person with Covid-19 now doesn't need to get tested,\" she said. Testing these individuals it \"key to contact tracing,\" she added, since so much virus transmission is due to people who are not exhibiting symptoms.\nOfficials from the World Health Organization said the opposite to the CDC on Thursday, emphasizing the importance of expanding testing for those who have had contact with someone who has the virus and finding people with no symptoms.\n\"We have recommendations to test suspect cases, and in situations where it is feasible and is possible, to expand testing where necessary to really look for the cases so that they could be isolated and contact tracing can ensue,\" Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead for Covid-19, said Thursday. Also on Thursday, leaders of the Association of American Medical Colleges said they were \"alarmed\" by the \"irresponsible\" changes to the CDC testing duielines.\n\"This recommendation is irresponsible when we know that roughly 40% of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions come from an asymptomatic person,\" AAMC Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Ross McKinney Jr. and AAMC President and CEO Dr. David Skorton said in the statement.\n\"These CDC guidelines go against the best interests of the American people and are a step backward in fighting the pandemic,\" the statement said.\nWhile not testing may be alright in some circumstances, there are others where it's necessary, said Dr. Carlos del Rio, infectious disease specialist and associate dean of Emory University School of Medicine. For example, if you've been in contact with someone who's not wearing a mask for 15 minutes.\n\"We don't want to decrease the amount of testing,\" del Rio said. \"We want to decrease cases by decreasing transmission, not by decreasing testing.\"\nCNN's Amanda Watts, Jamie Gumbrecht, Maggie Fox and Michael Nedelman contributed to this report.",

            "HeadLine": "Woman may have caught coronavirus in airplane toilet, researchers say",
            "Text": "(CNN)Researchers say they have evidence that a woman caught coronavirus on a flight -- perhaps in the jet's restroom.\n\nThe 28-year-old woman was among about 300 South Koreans evacuated from Italy at the height of the coronavirus pandemic in Milan last March, the researchers wrote in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.\n\"On the flight from Milan, Italy, to South Korea, she wore an N95 mask, except when she used a toilet,\" they wrote. \"The toilet was shared by passengers sitting nearby, including an asymptomatic patient. She was seated three rows away from the asymptomatic patient,\" they added. The South Korean officials who organized the flight had put into effect full infection control measures and tested everyone before they boarded. All the passengers and crew were quarantined when they got to South Korea, as well. Six passengers tested positive soon after arrival in South Korea.\nThe 28-year-old woman developed symptoms eight days after she got home and was hospitalized. \"Given that she did not go outside and had self-quarantined for three weeks alone at her home in Italy before the flight and did not use public transportation to get to the airport, it is highly likely that her infection was transmitted in the flight via indirect contact with an asymptomatic patient,\" the researchers at Soonchunhyang University College of Medicine in Seoul wrote.\nThere has been very little evidence about whether people can catch coronavirus on a flight, although many airlines have policies leaving more space for passengers, are cleaning aircraft more frequently, and are encouraging passengers to stay in their seats and not move about the aircraft. Evidence already shows aircraft ventilation systems clean the air quickly and thoroughly. \"This study was one of the earliest to assess asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 on an aircraft. Previous studies of inflight transmission of other respiratory infectious diseases, such as influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome, revealed that sitting near a person with a respiratory infectious disease is a major risk factor for transmission similar to our own findings,\" the researchers wrote.\nThe researchers said the officials organizing the flight took many precautions.\n\"When the passengers arrived at the Milan airport, medical staff performed physical examinations, medical interviews, and body temperature checks outside the airport before boarding, and 11 symptomatic passengers were removed from the flight,\" they wrote.\nPassengers got N95 respirators -- masks shown to protect the wearer for viral infections -- and were kept six feet apart before boarding. \"Most passengers wore the N95 respirators except at mealtimes and when using the toilet during the flight. After an 11-hour flight, 299 asymptomatic passengers arrived in South Korea and were immediately quarantined for two weeks at a government quarantine facility in which the passengers were completely isolated from one another. Medical staff examined them twice daily for elevated body temperature and symptoms of COVID-19.\"\nResearchers in Germany reported earlier this month that two people may have become infected before, during or after a flight from Tel Aviv to Frankfurt in March.\nThey were seated near the back of the aircraft, directly across the aisle from seven passengers who later turned out to have been infected.",

            "HeadLine": "CNN Poll: Most Americans embarrassed by US response to coronavirus",
            "Text": "(CNN)Nearly 7 in 10 Americans say the US response to the coronavirus outbreak makes them feel embarrassed, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS, as 62% of the public says President Donald Trump could be doing more to fight the outbreak.\n\nThe new poll finds disapproval of Trump's handling of the outbreak at a new high, 58%, as the share who say the worst of the pandemic is yet to come has risen to 55% after dropping through the spring. And as the virus has spread from the nation's cities throughout its countryside, the number who know someone who's been diagnosed with the virus has jumped dramatically to 67%, up from 40% in early June.\nAnd Americans are angry. About 8 in 10 say they are at least somewhat angry about the way things are going in the country today, including an astonishing 51% who say they are very angry. CNN has asked this question in polling periodically since 2008, and the previous high for the share who said they were \"very angry\" was 35%, reached in 2008 and 2016.\nA narrow majority of Americans, 52%, say they are not comfortable returning to their regular routines right now, and in the last two months, this group's expectations for when they might return to life as it was before the coronavirus have changed dramatically. In June, just 9% overall said they weren't comfortable now and didn't think they would be this year. Now, that figure stands at 26%.\nTwo of the most notable markers of resuming regular life -- returning to school and the restart of professional sports -- divide people.\nNearly 6 in 10 (57%) say schools in their area should not be open for in-person instruction this fall, while 39% say they should be open. Parents are more apt to say schools should open (47%), but a narrow majority say they should not (52%). This issue is sharply driven by partisanship: 74% of Republicans say their local schools should be open vs. 12% of Democrats.\nWhether pro sports should continue after disruption to some Major League Baseball games due to outbreaks among the players and staff divides the public about evenly: 49% say they should not be playing games, and 45% say they should.\nThe partisan divisions that have been the hallmark of public opinion on the coronavirus continue in this new poll.\nDemocrats (76%) and independents (58%) are far more likely to say the worst is yet to come in the outbreak than are Republicans (26%), and the poll finds a massive 64-point gap between the percentages of Republicans and Democrats who say they are comfortable returning to their regular routines today (82% among Republicans, 18% among Democrats).\nDemocrats are nearly unanimous in saying they are more embarrassed than proud about the American response to the virus (93% embarrassed, 5% proud), while Republicans are mostly proud (61% say so vs. 33% who are embarrassed).\nAnd anger in this election lies more among the backers of former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, than supporters of Trump. In July 2016, 54% of Trump supporters said they were \"very angry\" about the way things were going in the US; now, 34% feel that way. Among Biden's backers, 75% are very angry, up from 18% of Hillary Clinton voters who felt that way.\nThe poll finds a decline in the share of Americans who say they would try to get vaccinated against the coronavirus if a vaccine became widely available at a low cost: 56% say they would try to do so now, while 66% felt that way in May. The dip comes across several demographic divides but seems to be concentrated among Trump supporters, 51% of whom said they would seek out a vaccine in May compared with 38% who say the same now.\nMost Americans, though, are confident that the ongoing trials to develop a coronavirus vaccine are properly balancing speed and safety as they move forward (62% say they are at least somewhat confident, and 37% not too or not at all confident). That includes rare cross-party agreement: 68% of Democrats are confident about that, as are 66% of Republicans.\nIn one positive note for Trump in these findings, his approval rating for handling the economy has ticked up to 51%.\nBut Americans don't yet see much improvement in the economic downturn caused by th4e coronavirus. In fact, 43% now say the economy is continuing to worsen, up from 36% who felt that way in June. About a quarter (25%) say the economy is beginning to recover and 31% think it has stabilized, no longer worsening but also not yet improving. About half say they are facing financial hardship due to the coronavirus, a figure that has held roughly steady since April.\nThe CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS August 12 through 15 among a random national sample of 1,108 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer, including 987 registered voters. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. It is 4.0 points among registered voters.",

            "Text": "(CNN)In a shift that perplexed some doctors, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has changed its Covid-19 testing guidelines to say some people without symptoms may not need to be tested, even if they've been in close contact with someone known to have the virus.\n\nPreviously, the CDC said viral testing was appropriate for people with recent or suspected exposure, even if they were asymptomatic. Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University who was previously Baltimore's health commissioner, said on CNN's New Day on Wednesday that the testing guideline changes make no sense.\n\"These are exactly the people who should be tested,\" Wen said, giving the example of a person exposed at work who wants a test so they can protect their family at home.\nA senior federal health official close to the process tells CNN the sudden change in CDC Covid-19 testing guidance was the result of pressure from the Trump administration. When asked by CNN whether the CDC was responding to pressure from the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services, the senior official said, \"It's coming from the top down.\"\nHere's what the CDC website said previously: \"Testing is recommended for all close contacts of persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because of the potential for asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission, it is important that contacts of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection be quickly identified and tested.\" The CDC changed the site on Monday. Here's what it says now: \"If you have been in close contact (within 6 feet) of a person with a COVID-19 infection for at least 15 minutes but do not have symptoms, you do not necessarily need a test unless you are a vulnerable individual or your health care provider or State or local public health officials recommend you take one.\"\nThose who don't have Covid-19 symptoms and haven't been in close contact with someone with a known infection do not need a test, the updated guidelines say.\n\"Not everyone needs to be tested,\" the agency's website says. \"If you do get tested, you should self-quarantine/isolate at home pending test results and follow the advice of your health care provider or a public health professional.\"\nThe CDC guidelines say if someone has symptoms and they're mild, a health care provider \"may advise a COVID-19 test,\" and if symptoms are severe, people should contact a health care provider or seek emergency care.\n\"It is important to realize that you can be infected and spread the virus but feel well and have no symptoms,\" the updated CDC site says, noting that local public health officials might request asymptomatic \"healthy people\" be tested, depending on cases and spread in an area.\nIn its pandemic planning scenarios, the CDC says its current best estimate is that 40% of infections are asymptomatic and 50% of transmission occur before symptoms occur.\n'The guidelines baffle me,' doctor says\nDoctors were puzzled by the change and questioned why the CDC did not explain why it made the update.\nCDC referred questions to HHS. In a statement provided Wednesday to CNN, HHS Assistant Secretary Dr. Brett Giroir said: \"This Guidance has been updated to reflect current evidence and best public health practices, and to further emphasize using CDC-approved prevention strategies to protect yourself, your family, and the most vulnerable of all ages.\"\nHHS has not specified what change in \"current evidence\" may have driven the change.\nThe statement continued: \"The updated Guidance places an emphasis on testing individuals with symptomatic illness, those with a significant exposure or for vulnerable populations, including residents and staff in nursing homes or long term care facilities, critical infrastructure workers, healthcare workers and first responders, and those individuals (who may be asymptomatic) when prioritized by public health officials.\" Wen, the former Baltimore health commissioner, said, \"I'm concerned that these recommendations suggest someone who has had substantial exposure to a person with Covid-19 now doesn't need to get tested.\"\n\"This is key to contact tracing, especially given that up to 50% of all transmission is due to people who do not have symptoms. One wonders why these guidelines were changed -- is it to justify continued deficit of testing?\"\nDr. Carlos del Rio, infectious disease specialist and associate dean of Emory University School of Medicine, told CNN's Jim Sciutto on Wednesday that not testing may be OK in some circumstances -- brief contact, for example.\n\"But if you have been in contact for 15 minutes and that people doesn't have a mask, I think you need to be tested regardless if you have symptoms or not,\" he said. \"We know especially young people going into the house and then transmit inside the household. So, the guidelines baffle me and I really don't understand them.\"\nDel Rio added that he's concerned about politics influencing these decisions. He noted that President Trump has said in the past that more testing leads to the detection of more cases. \"I am worried that this is just a way to slow down testing and that would clearly be not good,\" deo Rio said. \"We don't want to decrease the amount of testing. We want to decrease cases by decreasing transmission, not by decreasing testing.\"\nA spokesperson at the US Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday denied the change would affect contact tracing efforts, which most public health officials say is key to any eventual control of the virus. \"The updated guidance does not undermine contact tracing or any other types of surveillance testing,\" the spokesperson said.\nHHS said people should consult with their doctors or with local health officials to decide if they need to be tested.\n\"The guidance fully supports public health surveillance testing, done in a proactive way through federal, state, and local public health officials,\" the spokesperson said.",

            "Text": "(CNN)Blood thinners appear to reduce the risk of death by up to 50% among seriously ill, hospitalized coronavirus patients, researchers reported Wednesday.\n\nAnd patients given anticoagulants also were 30% less likely to need a ventilator to help them breathe, a team at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York reported.\nTheir study of more than 4,300 patients also those who died often had evidence of blood clots throughout their bodies, even though many of them had no symptoms of the problem. It's more evidence of the serious, systemwide blood clotting that coronavirus infections can cause, but the findings offer hope of countering the effect. \"Compared to no anticoagulation, both prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation was associated with decreased mortality and intubation,\" the team wrote in their report, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. It was not a randomized controlled study, the gold standard for medical research. The study's leader, Dr. Valentin Fuster, says that's next. \"An international randomized trial just started with 15 institutions,\" Fuster told CNN. \"We are comparing three types of anticoagulants that work.\"\nFuster's team said 60% of patients who were not given anticoagulants were discharged alive, 26% of them died in the hospital and 13% were still in the hospital. When patients got the drug prophylactically to prevent blood clots, 75% were released alive, 22% died in the hospital and 3% were still hospitalized during the study period. The researchers said the reduction in the risk of death was similar in patients who got anticoagulants either to prevent clots, or after they began showing evidence of clotting.\nSal Mazzara is one of the survivors. He was hospitalized in early April as his coronavirus infection worsened and stayed on a ventilator for a month.\n\"Sal did not have any blood clots but he was given medicine every day for blood clots to prevent them,\" his wife, Josephine Mazzara, told CNN. At first Mazarra got the clotbusting drug tPA, used for emergency treatment of a stroke. He later got heparin and was sent home with Eliquis, known generically as apixaban -- a pill approved for preventing stroke. Mazzara's treatment required heavy sedation and an incision in his throat so he could be intubated. \"It was a horrible, horrible experience,\" Josephine Mazzara said.\n\"There's not much I can remember,\" Sal Mazzara, 48, told CNN. \"I completely blacked out.\"\nThe only specific treatment for coronavirus is the antiviral drug remdesivir. Mazzara got that drug, too, during his treatment, Josephine Mazzara said.\nDoctors have also learned that steroids, specifically dexamethasone, can also help patients recover better from coronavirus infections. Trials are under way to test blood-based therapies that deliver various types of antibodies to help patients fight off the infection, using plasma donated by people who have recovered from infections.\nIn the absence of a slam-dunk treatment for the virus, many medical teams are taking a cocktail approach, giving their patients a combination of drugs to control the immune response, control the virus and to control blood clotting. Mazzara continued on the blood thinner for a month after his release from the hospital in May. \"I'm like 90% back,\" he said.\nSoon after the pandemic hit New York City hard in March, doctors started noticing their patients were suffering from systemwide blood clotting. Blood clots clogged up kidney dialysis equipment and damaged the lungs, livers and hearts of patients.\nPhysicians now believe the inflammation caused by coronavirus infection is causing the clotting. Sometimes it causes no symptoms until it is too late.\nIn the Mt. Sinai study, autopsies on some of the patients who died showed that 42% had blood clots, including in their brains, lungs, liver and heart. \"They never had the clinical syndrome of a thrombotic disorder. It was silently causing damage,\" Fuster said. The doctors used several different anticoagulants and often more than one on each patient, so it is not possible to say which ones worked best. But Fuster said low molecular weight heparin and apixaban both showed positive effects.\nThe Mount Sinai team published study results involving 2,000 patients in May. Wednesday's report follows up with more patients who were treated more consistently.",

            "Text": "Washington (CNN)Dr. Anthony Fauci on Monday warned against the notion of early emergency use authorization for a potential coronavirus vaccine, explaining that such a step could damage efforts to develop other vaccines.\n\nHis comments come as White House officials have raised the possibility of an early emergency authorization before late-stage trials are finished, two sources have told CNN. Michael Caputo, the assistant secretary for public affairs at the US Department of Health and Human Services, has denied that there was any effort to fast-track vaccine development for political purposes.\nFauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, told Reuters that \"the one thing that you would not want to see with a vaccine is getting an EUA before you have a signal of efficacy.\"\n\"One of the potential dangers if you prematurely let a vaccine out is that it would make it difficult, if not impossible, for the other vaccines to enroll people in their trial,\" he said.\nSeveral vaccines are being tested in the US and companies are working to ramp up production while testing is going on, so that if a vaccine is proved safe and effective it could be distributed immediately. President Donald Trump has promised that a vaccine would be available by the end of the year, though vaccinologists told CNN that timeline is unrealistic. And though Trump has commented that a vaccine could be ready \"a lot sooner\" than the end of the year, a senior administration official close to the coronavirus task force said the timeline for a vaccine remains the same and a vaccine is still expected late this year or early next year.\nOn Saturday, Trump also accused, without providing any evidence, the US Food and Drug Administration of deliberately delaying coronavirus vaccine trials.\n\"The deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics,\" Trump tweeted, continuing to push his unfounded theory that there is a \"deep state\" embedded within the government bureaucracy working against his reelection.\nHe accused the agency of delaying a vaccine for the virus until after the fall election, tweeting, \"Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd. Must focus on speed, and saving lives!\"\nThe comments won't allay the fears some experts and Americans have that the administration will rush to prepare a vaccine at the expense of science and safety. A CNN poll in May found one-third of Americans said they would not try to get vaccinated against Covid-19, even if the vaccine is widely available and low-cost.\n\"To me, it's absolutely paramount that you definitively show that a vaccine is safe and effective, both,\" Fauci told Reuters. \"We would hope that nothing interferes with the full demonstration that a vaccine is safe and effective.\"\nThe White House's Sunday evening announcement about the FDA's emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma is only fueling more questions from medical experts about the safety and efficacy of any solutions Trump pushes.\nSeveral top health officials had previously been skeptical there was enough data to justify emergency plasma authorization. Among those skeptics: Fauci, Dr. Francis Collins, head of the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. H. Clifford Lane, who works under Fauci at the NIH, according to a knowledgeable source.\nA prominent vaccine expert told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Sunday that the White House may have bullied the FDA into giving emergency use authorization for blood plasma.\n\"I think what's happening here is you're seeing bullying, at least at the highest level of the FDA, and I'm sure that there are people at the FDA right now who are the workers there that are as upset about this as I am,\" said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\nFDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn has defended the emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma as data-driven.

            "Text": "(CNN)Early stage clinical trial results show the Covid-19 vaccine candidate made by Novavax is safe and elicits an immune response, according to a study published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine. The results had previously been announced by the company in early August. Using a randomized, placebo-controlled trial -- the gold-standard method of study -- scientists gave the vaccine or a placebo, an inert substance like saline, to 131 healthy adults in May. Eighty-three people got the vaccine with adjuvant, an agent to boost the body's immune response. Another 25 got the vaccine without the booster and 23 got the placebo. Participants also received a second injection 21 days after the first.\nThe volunteers came from two locations in Australia and they were all under the age of 60. People who had Covid-19 or who had recovered from Covid-19 were excluded from the trial.\nIn a phase Phase 1 trial, doctors mostly watch to see if the vaccine is safe, but they also check to see if it produced a response. For 35 days, participants were told to record any potential symptoms or soreness. Volunteers were also given a swab test for Covid-19 if they had any symptoms, and were tested 35 days after their first injection.\nAt day 35, there were no serious or unusual adverse events. One person reported a mild fever that lasted for a day after the second shot. Otherwise, most didn't have any reaction at all, or if they did have a reaction, it was mild. Two people in two of the vaccine groups had headache, fatigue and malaise for a median of two days or less. Two people from two of the vaccine groups had fatigue, malaise, and tenderness.\nAfter the second vaccination, most people didn't have any problems, or they were mild. One person had tenderness after the second shot and eight had joint pain and fatigue. The vaccine seemed to generate an immune response. All the volunteers who got the vaccine developed neutralizing antibodies after the second dose.\nAt day 35, participants who got two doses of the vaccine with the adjuvant developed neutralizing antibodies at levels more than four to six times greater than average than the antibodies developed by people who had recovered from Covid-19. Antibodies are the proteins the body naturally produces to fight off an infection or toxin.\nThe vaccine also seemed to generate T-cells, the type of immune cells that also help protect the body from infection, in the 16 volunteers who were randomly selected and tested for T-cell response. The benefit of adding adjuvant to the vaccine was clear, based on the antibody response it generated, the study found. It also showed the value of the second dose on day 21.\n\"Based on the positive Phase 1 results, we have begun multiple Phase 2 clinical trials, from which we expect to collect preliminary efficacy,\" said Dr. Gregory Glenn, president of research and development at Novavax. \"Novavax is committed to generating the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data that will support confident usage of the vaccine, both in the US and globally, and the data published today further bolsters our conviction that this is possible.\"\nThere are limits to what this trial can determine about the vaccine. It's a small number of patients and there were few Black and Latinx volunteers in the trial. The patients were also in good health. Dr. Paul Offit, Director of the Vaccine Education Center and professor of pediatrics at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said the results look good for this early stage.\n\"It will need to be tested in tens of thousands of people to see not just their response, but if you can prove that it is protective,\" Offit said. \"So we wait months to see if that happens.\"\nOffit noted that, compared to some of the other candidates among the 33 Covid-19 vaccines in various stages of development right now, this one may have an advantage, because it uses an approach that has been successfully tried with other vaccines, like those that protect against shingles. \"I think my takeaway from this is this is a tried and true vaccine strategy,\" Offit said. \"But we will have to wait and see if they prove it works.\"\nFive vaccines are in clinical trials in the US, and 33 around the world, according to the World Health Organization.",

Then on May 31 he sought care for fever, headache, dizziness, cough, nausea and diarrhea. Five days later, he was hospitalized and required ongoing oxygen support. He was tested again for Covid-19 and the results were positive. The Nevada researchers examined genetic material from both coronavirus specimens collected from the man. Their analysis suggests he had two distinct viral infections.\nThe pre-print study has not yet been peer-reviewed by a journal, but the researchers noted that the findings suggest humans can catch Covid-19 multiple times.\nIt's not the first case documented globally.\nEarlier this week, Hong Kong researchers said they found the first documented case of coronavirus reinfection in a 33-year-old man. He tested positive for Covid-19 twice this year.\nThe pre-print study -- which the University of Hong Kong said on Monday has been accepted by the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases -- found that the man was reinfected with two different versions of the virus 142 days apart. \"After one recovers from COVID-19, we still do not know how much immunity is built up, how long it may last, or how well antibodies play a role in protection against a reinfection,\" Mark Pandori, the director of the Nevada State Public Health Laboratory, said in a news release Thursday. \"If reinfection is possible on such a short timeline, there may be implications for the efficacy of vaccines developed to fight the disease. It may also have implications for herd immunity,\" Pandori said. \"It is important to note that this is a singular finding. It does not provide any information to us with regard to the generalizability of this phenomenon.\"\nIn the Hong Kong case, researchers said the man experienced coronavirus symptoms during his first bout of Covid-19, but that he didn't have any obvious symptoms the second time.",

            "HeadLine": "Are these fast, cheap coronavirus tests the game-changer everyone is waiting for?",
            "Text": "(CNN)Move over, slowpoke coronavirus tests that take a week or more to return a result -- there's a new generation of rapid tests coming to town -- some are already here -- and they're poised to transform the landscape. They are the antigen tests, but are they really all they're cracked up to be?\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization to another antigen test this week, bringing the total to four.\nCompared to the most commonly used type of coronavirus test in the country -- molecular diagnostic tests, also called PCR tests -- antigen tests don't need complicated chemicals, viral transport media or RNA extraction kits. They don't necessarily require appointments at specialized labs, highly trained technicians, or certain machines. And they can provide an answer in minutes, rather than hours or days Problems with any one of these critical PCR test components have led to bottlenecks for the entire process since the start of the pandemic, frustrating patients, doctors and public health experts alike.\nAntigen tests work a little differently. \"The PCR molecular tests actually test for the virus' genetic material and the antigen test is testing for one of the viral proteins, so a piece of the virus,\" said Dr. Jonathan Quick, managing director for pandemic response, preparedness and prevention at the Rockefeller Foundation.\nBecause of that, they're not as reliable as traditional PCR tests. According to the CDC, \"Antigen tests are more likely to miss an active coronavirus infection compared to molecular tests.\" Dr. Robert Murphy, a professor of infectious diseases at Northwestern University and the executive director of the Institute for Global Health, is a fan.\n\"The antigen tests are not PCR and can never be as sensitive as one of those, however, they are much faster -- approximately 15 minutes -- and don't require the PCR supply-chain of reagents which is also problematic. The cost is lower because the test is much more simple,\" he explained.\nAnd unlike the first three antigen tests approved, the newest antigen test to join their growing ranks, BinaxNOW, is \"the first COVID-19 diagnostic test that a health care provider can perform without an analyzer, meaning that test results can be read directly from the testing card,\" according to the FDA.\nAbbott, the manufacturer of the test, said in a news release the new test returns a result in 10 minutes. It's about the size of a credit card and will cost around $5. The company said it's planning to ship tens of millions of tests in September, ramping to 50 million tests a month at the beginning of October.\nThat's a big jump from our current testing capacity. According to data from the COVID Tracking Project, the U.S. conducted a little over 4.7 million tests last week. While that might sound like a lot, that still adds up to fewer than 20 million tests a month, and it's far less than the million-plus tests per day some public health experts say we should be doing. 'A disruptive innovation'\nWhen antigen tests finally arrive in great enough numbers on US shores -- which should happen within the next three months, according to the experts -- it could be a turning point in the pandemic for the country, a step on the road back to normalcy.\n\"Before people go back to work, before they go back to school, before they go to an event, they're going to be able to test themselves,\" said Murphy. \"The tests are going to be cheap. You could do it every day... And it's going to be a game changer.\"\nQuick, who literally wrote the book on ending epidemics, says the PCR test will always have a role as a highly accurate diagnostic test, but the antigen test will be used as a screening test for asymptomatic people. He called antigen tests a \"paradigm shift\" and \"disruptive innovation.\"\n\"We estimate that we need about 5 million tests a week for the continuing lab-based diagnostic [test] and about 25 million a week for asymptomatic surveillance testing. And so it's the antigen test, because they are a low cost, fast, and some of the recent ones highly accurate and convenient. So that combination really is what we need to get the scale we need, and the turnaround,\" he said. A question of accuracy\nWhile the antigen tests are not as accurate as the PCR tests, they are getting much better. \"There are four on the market as of today,\" said Murphy, noting that they range in sensitivity -- their ability to identify true positive cases -- between 84% and almost 98% of the time, with three of the four hovering around a respectable 97%.\nBut to some, giving quick results more than makes up for any shortfall in sensitivity. \"If you wait a week [for your result], you almost might as well not have bothered to do it, because you've infected all these people. It kind of defeats the whole purpose of having the test done. Whereas if you could pick up 80% of the people in 15 minutes, and just keep testing and testing, that will have a bigger public health effect than some really super test that takes one or two weeks to get the results back,\" said Murphy.\nSaid Quick, \"The first thing you want to do in any pandemic is to find the sick. The other thing you want to do is to keep the rest of the health system open. And when you don't have a fast test to separate who's got the virus and who doesn't, that's when you actually get transmission in health facilities.\"\nHe said he's \"a little bit dumbfounded\" that it has taken the country this long to get these rapid tests, which are in widespread use in countries like South Korea and India. \"These recent tests have been game changers. And so we're seeing the power and the potential of innovation,\" he said, adding that part of pandemic preparation is having these tools ready \"to go on the marching path.\"\nOther experts aren't convinced the tradeoff between accuracy and speed is worth it. \"I'm very concerned about the hype over the last 24 hours about a new test from Abbott. It's come out that this particular test is cheap, it's quick and it's effective. Let me just be really clear about this: I would not want to use this test on someone with clinical disease,\" Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said on CNN Friday.\nOsterholm compares it to the rapid flu test, which \"achieves about 50 to 70% positivity among those with influenza\" and which he doesn't recommend using. \"I see no reason why this is going to be different. So, this new heralded testing is a little bit smoke and mirrors,\" he said. He also notes that only 102 people were sampled in the material Abbot submitted to the FDA to get the EUA.\nOsterholm said he's concerned that the country will also see \"a big drop in the number of positives\" if the test only picks up 50-70% of cases, creating a false rate of infection. \"So even that is a challenge this week in how it is being touted in the public,\" he said.\nRamping up testing\nThe White House announced a $760 million deal Thursday to buy 150 million tests from Abbott, which it said will \"be potentially deployed to schools and to assist with serving other special needs populations, according to an HHS statement.\nAnd just over a week ago, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced it was invoking the Defense Production Act (DPA) -- a Cold war-era law that gives the president the emergency authority to direct private companies to prioritize orders from the federal government -- to get fast coronavirus tests from two other suppliers, Becton Dickinson and Quidel, to roughly 14,000 certified nursing home in the US. In the upcoming months, expect to see many more antigen tests joining the current ones. \"They're coming and there's dozens of them,\" said Murphy. He's part of an initiative at the National Institutes of Health called Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics or RADx. At the end of July, the NIH announced that it had invested nearly $250 million in seven companies for new Covid-19 testing technologies through RADx.\n\"It's about ramping up all the tests... And that's just the first seven of dozens. And so, we expect the testing capacity to increase radically by the end of the year... It's kind of like Operation Warp Speed with the vaccines. It's going like gangbusters,\" he said.\n'Don't use the test to get complacent'\nThe impending tsunami of cheaper, faster and more readily available tests comes just as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quietly updated its Covid-19 testing guidelines to say asymptomatic people may not need a test, even if they've been exposed to the virus. And testing has been trending down a bit. The rolling daily average actually dropped to 611,382 on August 23 from its peak of approximately 822,000 tests on July 29, according to the COVID Tracking project.\nThe change to the CDC guidelines was quickly denounced by public health experts, who say more, not less, testing is needed.\n\"As some of you know, the CDC posted on its website recommendations on quarantine, and on testing, that are frankly not scientifically supportable, and this was done apparently at the behest of people in Washington,\" former CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden said during a Thursday news briefing.\nHe called the changes \"dangerous.\"\nQuick agreed that surveillance testing is of utmost importance, and antigen testing as at the forefront of that effort. \"It's absolutely vital because what it'll do is let us identify those who are carrying the virus -- about 20% are asymptomatic, 30, 40, 50 even in some cases -- so we can get them out of circulation, we can trace their contacts,\" he said. Yet despite Quick's enthusiasm about antigen testing, he has one big caveat: \"What's really important is that people don't use the test to get complacent, because the tests aren't going to do anything to change the virus,\" he said. \"And so the personal protective habits need to keep up, in terms of masks and handwashing and distancing and avoiding crowded indoor places.\"\nIn other words, we may still have miles to go before we reach the land of normalcy.",

            "HeadLine": "White House focus on oleandrin treatment for coronavirus would be 'nonsense,' experts say",
            "Text": "(CNN)Is the White House about to promote a new, unproven and sketchy coronavirus treatment?\n\nMike Lindell, the CEO of MyPillow and an enthusiastic Trump supporter, says so. He told CNN he took part in a July meeting with President Trump to discuss oleandrin as a potential treatment for coronavirus.\nBut such early enthusiasm for the compound, made using a toxic shrub, is not only strange, but disturbing, three infectious disease specialists told CNN Monday.\nIt's only been tested in laboratory dishes and is very unlikely to end up as a treatment for the infection, they said.\n\"This is really just nonsense and a distraction,\" Dr. Jonathan Reiner, CNN medical analyst and a professor of medicine at George Washington University, told CNN's Anderson Cooper. Oleandrin, made from the flowering oleander plant, is a compound similar to the digoxin that comes from flowers known as foxgloves. Both are extremely toxic. \"You can find online a preprint, non-peer-reviewed paper that seems to suggest that in vitro, in other words in test tubes, that there is some antiviral activity for this compound,\" Reiner said.\n\"But I can tell you there are millions of compounds that, when tested in vitro, in a test tube, appear to have some antiviral activity but that are worthless in vivo, in humans.\"\nThe research itself is solid, performed by a team led by Scott Weaver of the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses at the University of Texas Medical Branch. \"Oleandrin has been recognized as the active principle ingredient in oleander extracts used in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of patients with cancer,\" they wrote. \"These trials defined the pharmacokinetics of oleandrin and demonstrated that extracts containing this molecule could be given safely as an oral drug to patients without significant adverse events. Less appreciated is the strong antiviral activity of this class of compounds.\" Their tests of the compound in monkey cells grown in lab dishes suggested it could inactivate coronavirus.\nBut the researchers added that animal tests are needed before any further discussion of the use of the drug against coronavirus.\nDr. Peter Hotez, dean of the school of tropical medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, agreed. \"It should be added to the growing list of compounds that are tested in laboratory animals. That's it,\" Hotez told Cooper. \"The likelihood that this would actually emerge as a proven therapy is still remote,\" he added. \"Even after animal testing it could still fail in clinical trials.\"\nLast week, Lindell was added to the board of Phoenix Biotechnology, which makes oleandrin, and received a financial stake in the company. Trump said he had \"heard about\" oleandrin. \"Is it something people are talking about very strongly?\" he asked a reporter on the White House lawn.\n\"We'll look at it, we'll look at it, we're looking at a lot of different things,\" he said.\nHotez said he could not understand why the administration would focus on this particular product. \"Why pivot towards this?\" he asked. \"It's somewhat odd or bizarre the way the President or the White House tends to go for these really strange types of miracle cures.\"\nReiner likened it to President Trump's previous support of hydroxychloroquine, now shown to be unhelpful in treating coronavirus. \"What is bothersome to me about this is less about this worthless botanical but more about the sidelining of scientists and the elevation of these sketchy characters who have access to the President and can tell the President that 'something's magic -- you should approve it.' It's incredibly disturbing to me,\" Reiner said. Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University, has some simple advice for the public. \"Don't take it. Stay away. This is quackery,\" he told CNN's Jake Tapper. \"Do not take medications of any kind to either prevent this infection or to treat it that hasn't been vetted very, very carefully by the scientific community.\"",

            "Text": "(CNN)It's been five months since Lucy Gahan contracted Covid-19, and her life still hasn't returned to normal.\n\nGahan, a clinical psychologist in Shrewsbury, United Kingdom, hasn't been able to return to work.\nThe disease causes what she calls \"storms,\" disabling periods when she feels shortness of breath, numbness in her hands and feet and her heart rate shoots up from simple tasks. Even taking a shower is possible only during an occasional respite in symptoms.\n\"In May and June, I could barely talk because I was so ill,\" she said.\nBefore contracting the disease in early April, the mother of two ran three times a week and had a regular yoga routine.\n\"I can only walk as far as the corner,\" she said. \"In terms of running, I can't imagine when that will happen, if ever.\"\nShe is one of thousands around the world for whom Covid-19 has turned into a chronic condition. Gahan and other Covid-19 \"long haulers\" feel they aren't yet getting recognition for an illness that has disabled them for months, with no end in sight.\n\"I'm a clinical psychologist, and this is not anxiety,\" she said. \"If doctors just say 'We don't know,' it's better than saying Covid symptoms only last two weeks.\"\nMany hospitalized for Covid-19 at risk to become 'long haulers'\nAbout three-quarters of those hospitalized for Covid-19 could become long haulers, according to a paper uploaded to the pre-print server medRxiv on August 14 without having yet been vetted by outside experts or accepted for publication.\nResearchers from the Academic Respiratory Unit of the North Bristol NHS Trust in the UK looked at 110 Covid-19 patients, whose illnesses required hospital stays for a median of five days between March 30 and June 3. Twelve weeks after patients were released from the hospital, 74% of them reported symptoms, including breathlessness and excessive fatigue.\nDespite these symptoms, however, 104 of the 110 patients in the study had normal basic blood test results, with just 12% showing an abnormal chest X-ray and 10% showing restrictive lung function through spirometry tests.\nThe British Medical Journal released new guidance for health providers in August on how to treat long-haul Covid-19 patients, estimating that up to 10% of all people who have tested positive could develop a prolonged illness. The guidance includes specific blood tests to perform, possibly referring patients to pulmonary rehabilitation and having them use pulse oximetry at home to measure oxygen saturation in the blood.\nResults like these fly in the face of a narrative that took hold early in the pandemic, in which many medical professionals believed that the average Covid-19 patient would be sick for a couple weeks, clear the virus and be fine afterward. That turns out not to be the case for everyone. The BMJ guidance cited \"weak or absent antibody response, relapse or reinfection, inflammatory and other immune reactions, deconditioning, and mental factors such as post-traumatic stress\" as contributing to longer-term symptoms. It acknowledged that similar parallels had occurred in patients with SARS and MERS.\n\"The classic case we all have in our hands is not always what really happens,\" said Dr. MeiLan King Han, a pulmonologist and professor of medicine at the University of Michigan. \"For the patients I have followed, many continue to complain of cough, breathing issues and severe fatigue long after their first infection.\"\nLong haulers and dysautonomia\nOne of the key issues in caring for each long-haul Covid-19 patient is to figure out how many of their symptoms can be chalked up to the heart and lungs and how much of the illness is actually the result of a deeper form of neurological dysfunction the coronavirus has unspooled, according to Noah Greenspan, a New York-based physical therapist and founder of the Pulmonary Wellness Foundation.\nBefore engaging in physical or respiratory therapy, he asks that all his patients get a full workup from their doctor to rule out a cardiac condition, stroke or pulmonary embolism before starting physical therapy.\nSome patients' symptoms are mild and can start a more traditional rehab plan, he said, \"but there are others, which are turning into the biggest group of people, which are these long haulers.\" The primary trend across the Covid-19 long haulers that Greenspan is working with is a condition called dysautonomia, a condition marked by a miscommunication between the autonomic nervous system and the rest of the body.\nThe autonomic nervous system regulates automatic body functions such as breathing, sleep and digestion. When it's not working, symptoms can present in myriad different ways, depending on the person.\n\"Reach into a bag of symptoms and pull out a bag of symptoms, and that's what they have for the day,\" Greenspan said. \"It's a twisted ball of yarn and takes a week to unravel one string.\"\nWhile shortness of breath and cardiovascular problems do present in his patients, Greenspan said, these are not usually the most common underlying cause of their misery.\nGahan and others with long-haul Covid-19 symptoms face a condition called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, which refers to a sharp rise in heart rate that occurs when moving from a reclining to standing position. The pull of gravity causes blood to pool in the legs. This condition can cause dizziness, lightheadedness and fainting. \"Their heart rate goes up 50 to 75 points if they get up to get water,\" Greenspan said. \"They have fast heart rates that don't have anything to do with what they're actually doing, that are not commensurate with their workload.\"\nMany patients are exhibiting neurological symptoms consistent with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, according to the BMJ and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci. That diagnosis requires at least six months of symptoms, a benchmark most long haulers haven't yet reached.\nFor many, lung damage not the biggest issue\nMany Covid-19 patients feel that the medical system is gaslighting them, telling them there's nothing wrong even though their whole lives have been upended by Covid-19's aftermath.\nCorey Coopersmith, a 36-year-old fitness consultant in Las Vegas, hasn't been able to work since first getting sick in late February. He suffers a constant ebb and flow of symptoms, and yet visit after visit to medical specialists has turned out a series of \"normal\" lab tests.\n\"A month ago, I had a pulmonary exam, and I got 120% on the gas exchange test,\" Coopersmith said, noting the doctor told him, \"Your lung function is amazing.\"\nBut a breakthrough came when he finally visited an immunologist who performed tests that indicated abnormally low function of immune cells, including T cells and B cells.\n\"Have you been tested for HIV?\" the immunologist asked Coopersmith, he recalled. \"Your blood work looks like someone about to get AIDS.\" An immunologist finally found disturbances in Coopersmith's immune system that appeared to be on par with HIV/AIDS even though he doesn't have HIV.\nA mixed martial arts fighter in his 20s, Coopersmith was in great shape when he contracted Covid-19 in February, boasting of a resting heart rate of 58 beats per minute.\nNow though, when he wakes up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, POTS can drive his heart rate to 200.\nTo make it possible to sleep under his new constraints, he bought a continuous positive airway pressure machine, a device with a face mask that pushes oxygen into his lungs.\n\"I lie there gasping for air, fighting for life,\" he said.\nFor many, lung damage not the biggest issue\nCoopersmith is one of many Covid survivors trying to grasp why he feels so breathless even though his lung function is excellent.\n\"I feel like my lungs have recovered quite well,\" Gahan, the clinical psychologist in the UK, said.\nHer main issue has been pinpointing what has been causing the storms of illness, which are primarily neurological symptoms, including migraines and numbness in her feet and hands. She feels they can be explained by dysautonomia. \"I can't do anything except to just go to bed,\" she said, noting how lights and sounds and emotional stressors exacerbate her ongoing sickness. \"I can't stand any interaction.\"\nPatients hope their stories of halted recoveries might dissuade others from taking risks with infection by traveling, partying or gathering in large groups prior to development and distribution of a vaccine.\n\"It's not about fatigue. It's about really nasty symptoms that take over your whole life for who knows how long,\" Gahan said. \"Think about people like me when you're thinking about what decisions you should make.\"",

            "Text": "(CNN)Despite frequent warnings from health officials that big gatherings can spread Covid-19, large groups continue to congregate across the United States leading to outbreaks in communities, on college campuses and beyond.\n\nUniversities in at least 19 states have reported outbreaks, some tied to large group gatherings.\nFollowing what the dean of students and head of public safety called \"incredibly reckless behavior,\" 23 Syracuse University students were suspended Thursday after gathering on the campus quad at night. The next day, citing \"a rapidly escalating increase\" in the percentage of people testing positive for the virus, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill announced that testing would be implemented for three residence halls. Meanwhile, at least 26 cases of coronavirus in three states are being linked to the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, which drew thousands of people to South Dakota earlier this month.\nAnd an individual who tested positive for the virus after a Maine wedding reception has died according to a statement Saturday from Robert Peterson, CEO of Millinocket Regional Hospital. At least 32 positive cases were linked to the August 7 wedding, CNN has previously reported.\n\"We are sorry to share that this patient passed away early (Friday) afternoon. Our thoughts and sympathies are with her family as they cope with this difficult loss,\" Peterson said.\nMasks could save 70,000 lives, Murray says\nTo prevent outbreaks from becoming even more widespread, Dr. Chris Murray said it's time for local governments to enforce more stringent mask rules.\n\"It will take a concerted effort but the impact is extraordinary, it's really quite extraordinary what it could achieve,\" Murray, chief of the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Friday night. \"It really depends on what our leaders do, (both) as individuals, and what governments do.\"\nIHME projected that if nothing about the nation's approach to prevention changed, death rates would dip in September but rise later in the fall, and the total would reach about 310,000 by December 1. But if significantly more people -- about 95% of the US population -- wore masks, the projection of total deaths from now to December would drop by almost 70,000, he said.\nOn the other hand, if governments ease current social distancing restrictions and mask mandates, the daily US death toll could reach 6,000 by December, up from his current prediction of 2,000 daily, Murray said.\nMore than 176,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the US since the pandemic began, and more than 5.6 million have been infected, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\nCoronavirus case rates have been dropping for weeks in parts of the US, but death rates have been relatively elevated.\nConvalescent plasma for Covid-19 treatment\nThe US Food and Drug Administration on Sunday issued an emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma for the treatment of Covid-19 in hospitalized patients.\nConvalescent plasma is created from the blood of people who have recovered from Covid-19, and it has shown some success in two other deadly coronaviruses: MERS and SARS. It has also been used to treat flu and Ebola.\nThe agency said it concluded that it may be effective in treating Covid-19 and that \"the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product.\" \"At the same time, we will continue to work with researchers to continue randomized clinical trials to study the safety and effectiveness of convalescent plasma in treating patients infected with the novel coronavirus,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said in a statement.\nPresident Donald Trump said during a briefing Sunday the emergency use authorization of convalescent plasma to treat Covid-19 patients will \"save countless lives.\"\n\"Today's action will dramatically increase access to this treatment,\" Trump said.\nPatients who were treated with convalescent plasma that contained high levels of antibodies within three days of their diagnoses benefited the most from treatment, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said during the briefing.\n\"We dream in drug development of something like a 35% mortality reduction. This is a major advance in the treatment of patients,\" Azar said.\nEmergency use authorization from the FDA does not require the same level of evidence as full FDA approval. At the end of March, the FDA created a pathway for scientists to try convalescent plasma with patients and study its impact.\nPhysicians have been using the treatment since. So far, more than 60,000 people in the United States have been treated with convalescent plasma.\nSome states see positive changes\nNew York and New Jersey were early hotspots of the coronavirus pandemic but both reported encouraging signs this week.\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy tweeted Saturday afternoon that the state saw its lowest number of coronavirus-related hospitalizations since March 24.\n\"It's incredible what we've achieved by pulling together as one New Jersey family, but we're not over the finish line yet. Keep it up,\" he posted. And New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office reported in a news release Saturday that the infection rate in the state stayed below 1% for 15 straight days, setting a new record low.\nFor the first time in two months, the number of coronavirus-related hospitalizations in Mississippi dropped below 1,000, according to Gov. Tate Reeves.\nMeanwhile, other states are reaching troubling milestones.\nCalifornia's death toll is nearing 12,000, the California Department of Public Health said Saturday. With 95 deaths reported Saturday, Georgia broke 5,000 coronavirus deaths.\nConcerns and questions around the new school year\nThe start of a new school year with in-person classes has brought trepidation to some Americans as more young people suffer infections.\nIn Florida, a 6-year-old girl became the youngest person in the state to die from coronavirus complications. Health officials say they still don't know if the child contracted the virus from a known case or if it was travel related.\nMany schools across the country have implemented increased measures to protect students and staff against the virus, even though researchers are still learning how the virus spreads among young children.\nFor older students, universities have responded to rising numbers with more preventative measures. On Sunday, Georgia Tech reported 33 new cases of Covid-19, including 17 members of a Greek organization. This brings the total number of coronavirus cases at George Tech to 251.\nThe University of Miami reported four students in its Hecht Residential College had tested positive for Covid-19, officials said on the university's Covid-19 website. Those students, and several others \"who have shown symptoms,\" were immediately removed from their floors and are in isolation, officials said.\nAt Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, students began moving into campus dorms on a staggered schedule with designated hours to promote social distancing.\n\"I think it's everywhere. I don't think there's any hiding from it. I think just protecting yourself is the best thing you can do,\" Kari Thronson, the parent of a college freshman, said.\nMany colleges have already reversed plans for in-person classes and returned to remote learning after coronavirus cases were detected on campus, leading to quarantines.\nTowson University in Baltimore County, Maryland, is temporarily moving to online classes after 55 people tested positive for Covid-19 on campus over two days last week, the university said Saturday. At East Carolina University, interim Chancellor Ron Mitchelson said in a letter Sunday that the university is moving to online classes due to a \"rapid acceleration\" of cases and \"multiple clusters.\" The move comes two weeks after students returned to campus.\nThe University of Notre Dame in Indiana announced Tuesday that undergraduates would be learning remotely for the next two weeks after a spike in Covid-19 cases since students returned to campus on August 3. Since August 3, more than 408 students have tested positive, according to Notre Dame's online health dashboard.",

During his first episode of illness, the patient had a cough, sore throat, fever and headache for three days, according to the study. He tested positive for Covid-19 on March 26.\nThen during his second episode, the patient was returning to Hong Kong from traveling in Spain via the United Kingdom, and he tested positive during his entry screening at the Hong Kong airport on August 15, the researchers said. The man was hospitalized again but remained asymptomatic. \"The patient got re-infected 4.5 months after the first infection. Therefore, it shows that for this patient, the immunity induced by the first infection is short lasting,\" Dr. Kelvin Kai-Wang To of the University of Hong Kong, who worked on the study, said in an email to CNN.\nFor the study, researchers at the university and various hospitals in Hong Kong analyzed specimens collected from the patient 10 days after his symptoms emerged in the first episode and then one day after hospitalization for the second episode.\nGenetic analysis suggested that the first infection was from a strain of the coronavirus most closely related to strains from the United States or England, and the second infection was most closely related to strains from Switzerland and England. \"This case illustrates that re-infection can occur even just after a few months of recovery from the first infection. Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may persist in humans, as is the case for other common-cold associated human coronaviruses, even if patients have acquired immunity via natural infection or via vaccination,\" the researchers wrote.\nThe findings also show that people who have had coronavirus already should nonetheless get vaccinated if and when a vaccine becomes available, the researchers wrote.\n. \"Patients with previous COVID-19 infection should also comply with epidemiological control measures such as universal masking and social distancing,\" they wrote.\nThe researchers called this the \"first case\" of re-infection of Covid-19 in their paper, but other experts are calling for more research. \"What I think is really important is that we put this into context,\" Maria Van Kerkhove, the World Health Organization's technical lead for coronavirus response and head of the emerging diseases and zoonoses unit, said during a media briefing in Geneva on Monday.\n\"There's been more than 24 million cases reported to date. And we need to look at something like this on a population level. And so it's very important that we document this -- and that, in countries that can do this, if sequencing can be done, that would be very, very helpful. But we need to not jump to any conclusions,\" Van Kerkhove said.\n\"Even if this is the first documented case of reinfection, it is possible of course because with our experience with other human coronaviruses, and the MERS coronavirus and the SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus, we know that people have an antibody response for some time but it may wane.\" This case of possible Covid-19 reinfection came as no surprise to Dr. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia's Norwich School of Medicine in Britain who was not involved in the new study.\n\"The report from Hong Kong of a re-infection in a man by COVID-19 that was genetically different from the first infection should not be too surprising. It is, however, important that this is documented,\" Hunter said in a written statement distributed by the UK-based Science Media Centre on Monday.\n\"Of particular note was that the case was a young and otherwise healthy person and that the second infection was diagnosed 4.5 months after the initial episode,\" he said.\n\"Commentators have been saying for some time that immunity is unlikely to be permanent and may only last a few months. Given the different intensity of the antibody response in people with mild or severe illness and the subsequent decay in levels, it is likely that those with a mild illness will have a shorter duration of immunity than those with severe illness.\" Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital of Philadephia, said it was \"great news\" that the man in the new study had no symptoms the second time he was infected.\n\"That's all you want to see,\" said Offit, who was not involved in the study.\nHe told CNN that this is a good indicator that a Covid-19 vaccine will do something similar.\n\"It's encouraging for the vaccine that his first infection induced an immune response that protected against disease,\" Offit said.\nOverall, the new study \"is a textbook example of how immunity should work,\" Akiko Iwasaki, of the Yale School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study, wrote in a Twitter post on Monday. \"Second infection was asymptomatic. While immunity was not enough to block reinfection, it protected the person from disease,\" Iwasaki tweeted. \"Patient had no detectable antibody at the time of reinfection but developed detectable antibody after reinfection. This is encouraging.\"\nShe added that since reinfection can occur, herd immunity by natural infection is unlikely to eliminate the novel coronavirus.\n\"The only safe and effective way to achieve herd immunity is through vaccination,\" Iwasaki tweeted. \"Lastly, while this is a good example of how primary infection can prevent disease from subsequent infection, more studies are needed to understand the range of outcomes from reinfection.\"\nCNN's Elizabeth Cohen contributed to this report.",

            "HeadLine": "US and UK are bottom of the pile in rankings of governments' handling of coronavirus pandemic",
            "Text": "(CNN)Americans rank dead last -- by a long way -- among citizens of more than a dozen countries who were asked whether their nation is more united now than it was before the coronavirus pandemic, according to a survey released Thursday.\n\nAnd they come in a statistical joint last place with the British on whether their country has handled the pandemic well, the poll finds.\nIn the United States, fewer than two in 10 people (18%) said the country is more united now.\nThat's a full 21 percentage points below the next lowest-ranking countries, Germany and France, where just under four in 10 (39%) respondents expressed that opinion. Denmark had the highest percentage saying their country was more united now, with more than seven in 10 (72%) giving that answer.\nAs with so many questions these hyper-partisan days, there's a gigantic gap between Republican and Democratic views of whether the Trump administration has handled the pandemic well.\nThree quarters (76%) of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said the government has done a good job. Only one quarter (25%) of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents agree. The findings come from a Pew Research Center survey of 14 advanced economies in North America, Europe and Asia. The Washington, DC-based think tank interviewed 14,276 adults by telephone from June 10 to August 3. Role of politics\nA clear majority of people across the 14 countries said their own nation had handled Covid-19 well: 73% agreed, while 27% disagreed.\nBut in the United Kingdom and the United States, the figures were much lower: 46% and 47% respectively. They're the only two countries where a minority of people said the government had done well. In every other country polled, most people said their government had done well, from Japan with 55% up to Denmark with 95%.\nThe United States is not the only country where support for the government's coronavirus response broke along partisan lines -- the Pew survey detected the same pattern in the UK and in Spain.\nThose results show it's not a matter of whether you're on the left or the right of the political spectrum that predicts whether you think your government has done well. The US and UK have right-leaning governments, while Spain has a left-leaning one. In each country, people with the same political bent as the government tend to say it's done well in the crisis. John Curtice, one of Britain's leading polling experts, said that phenomenon is well understood by social scientists.\n\"Generally speaking, it doesn't matter what you're asking: the government in power is more likely to be seen well by people who voted for it than people who didn't,\" said Curtice, a professor at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow.\nBut he pointed out that the findings do make it possible to compare how well each government is doing among its own supporters.\nIn Spain and the United States, about three-quarters of government supporters say their country has handled the coronavirus well -- but in the UK, the figure is just over half.\nPew Research Center research associate Kat Devlin pointed out that not all countries polled had a political divide over views of the government response, \"especially in countries with high levels of overall satisfaction with how their nation has dealt with the COVID-19 outbreak.\"\n\"In Denmark, currently led by the center-left Social Democrats, and in Australia, whose leader Scott Morrison belongs to the center-right Liberal Party of Australia, at least nine-in-ten adults on both the political left and political right believe their country has done well against the coronavirus,\" Devlin, one of the report authors, told CNN by email.\nEconomic confidence is also linked to the belief the government is doing well. In all 14 countries in the survey, people who said the current economic situation is good were more likely to say the government was doing a good job on coronavirus.\nAgain, the US is the most extreme example of the trend: There's a 44-point gap between those who say the current economic situation is bad but the government is handling the crisis well (34%) and those who say the economic situation is good and the government is handling the crisis well (78%). Life changes\nOne possibly surprising area where the United States falls smack in the middle of the pack is on the question of whether more international cooperation would have reduced the number of coronavirus cases in their country. Across the whole 14-country survey, 59% of people said it would, while 36% said it would not. In the United States, 58% said more cooperation between countries would have helped and 37% said it would not.\nAmong other findings in the survey, women in every country are more likely than men to say their lives have changed because of the crisis, with a gap as high as 15 points in the United States, France and Sweden.\nAnd perhaps most surprising of all, in Sweden -- which famously put almost no restrictions in place to stop the spread of the virus -- more than seven out of 10 people (71%) said their lives had changed a great deal as a result of the outbreak. That's the second highest percentage of any country in the survey, behind South Korea (81%), which put sweeping restrictions in place.\nThe Pew Research Center conducted nationally representative telephone surveys of adults in the United States, Canada, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, the UK, Australia, Japan and South Korea.\nThe study was conducted only in countries where nationally representative telephone surveys are feasible.\n\"Due to the coronavirus outbreak, face-to-face interviewing is not currently possible in many parts of the world that we have previously included in our research,\" report co-author Devlin said. \"We have surveyed in 12 of these nations virtually every year since 2016, and they represent some of the world's largest economies and traditional allies of the US.\"",

            "Text": "(CNN)More than 70,000 new Covid-19 cases in children have been reported across the US since early August, new data shows.\n\nChild cases increased by 21% between August 6 and August 20, according to an updated joint report from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association. More than 440,000 children have been infected in the US since the start of the pandemic, the report said. Despite the climbing numbers, severe illness in children from the virus is rare, the report said. But updated guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report posted earlier this month notes the rate of hospitalizations among children is increasing.\nOf those hospitalized, about one in three children is admitted to intensive care -- the same as adults.\nThe new data reflects what experts have highlighted as students prepared for a return to school: while the risk for Covid-19-related complications seems to be lower, there are still a lot of unknowns when it comes to children and the virus -- including how big their role is in transmitting it.\nAs several Georgia schools moved forward with reopening earlier this month, hundreds of students and staff were asked to quarantine after districts reported Covid-19 cases. In Florida, a legal battle may determine when students will make a physical return to class.\nThe Florida Education Association, a teachers' union, sued after the state announced that all \"brick and mortar\" schools would have to reopen this month. A judge blocked that requirement Monday with a temporary injunction and the state has since appealed.\nIn Mississippi, nearly 4,000 students and close to 600 teachers are quarantined due to Covid-19 exposure, officials said. At a news conference Tuesday, state health officer Dr. Thomas E. Dobbs III announced 144 new teacher cases and 292 student cases for last week. \"These numbers that we're seeing in our schools are not unexpected,\" Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said. \"I am pleased the number of isolations that we're seeing, the quarantines that we're seeing.\"\n\"And I'm pleased that there are a large number of Mississippi kids that are sitting in a classroom right now learning in a safe environment and so we got to continue to monitor it, we've got to continue to be careful,\" he added.\nIn New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday announced a \"Bridge to School Plan\" to assist students with their mental health needs at the start of the school year.\nThe plan includes a student curriculum, training for teachers and resources for in-person and remote learning, according to de Blasio.\n\"There is no health without mental health,\" the mayor told reporters.\nDe Blasio said new emotional support training will be available to teachers whenever they need it. All 1,600 public school principals across the city have been trained to assist with their mental and emotional needs, New York City School Chancellor Richard Carranza said.\nStudy: Immune response may play role in why men are more likely to die than women\nResearchers have known for some time that men are more likely to die from Covid-19 than women -- and a new study sheds light on some possible key differences in immune responses to the disease that may help to explain why. Women appeared to have a more robust immune response to the virus that causes Covid-19 compared with men in the study, which published in the journal Nature.\nResearchers from Yale University analyzed blood samples, nasal swabs, saliva, urine and stool specimens from 98 adult Covid-19 patients admitted to the Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut between March 18 and May 9. Researchers observed \"a more robust T cell response among female patients compared to male patients,\" they wrote in the study. \"Importantly, the T cell response was significantly and negatively correlated with patients' age in male, but not female, patients.\"\nT cells are an important part of the immune system and protect the body from infection.\n\"The study is observational (limiting our ability to make any inference regarding cause and effect), the number of patients in some of the groups is low (making it difficult to draw any firm conclusions) and the underlying hypothesis is very broad (are there sex differences in immune parameters of COVID-19 patients?)\" Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious diseases at the UK's University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the study, said in a statement Wednesday.\nOfficials recommend more aggressive measures in Georgia\nWhile cases nationally have been on the decline and the seven-day daily death average has also dipped, experts still point to several areas of concern.\nThose include the country's heartland, which CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said last week seemed \"stuck\" as other parts of the country were noting improvements in Covid-19 trends.\nThe key, Redfield said, is to stick with mitigation measures, which have helped drive cases of the virus down. According to the White House Task Force for the virus, there are more areas of concern.\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution and WABE first reported on the group's latest report, which says Georgia's improvements remain fragile and the state could suffer more without further aggressive actions to control the spread of the virus -- including a statewide mandate on masks and shutting down bars in areas with high transmission rates.\nGeorgia is among only a handful of states -- including Florida -- that hasn't implemented a statewide mask requirement. Masks, experts have said for months, are currently among the country's most powerful tools when it comes to curbing the spread of the virus.\nAn influential Covid-19 model updated its US death toll projection last week to show about 70,000 lives could be saved across the country in the next months if more Americans wore masks. CNN has reached out to the White House and the task force for comment, but in the past they have declined to make these reports public.\nCandice Broce, a spokeswoman for Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, said in an email, \"Since the last Coronavirus Task Force report was leaked to the AJC, our new cases per 100,000 people has dropped by 22.68%.\" The report was dated August 23.\nIn the last seven days, cases across Georgia have declined by 12%. Over the last two weeks, the state has seen a 26.26% decrease in cases, according to an analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University.\nThe governor has defended the state's Covid-19 strategies and Broce added the task force report, which CNN has not independently verified, shows \"Georgia is making progress and has seen a decrease in new cases and a decrease in test positivity over the last week.\" But for the second week in a row, Georgia is among the worst in the nation for new cases.\nOn Tuesday, the state's health department reported 2,236 new cases of the virus, bringing the state's total infections to more than 258,000. It is the state with the fifth-highest number of infections in the US, according to Johns Hopkins. pandemic.\nCNN's Ray Sanchez, Jacqueline Howard, Andrea Kane, Nick Valencia, Maria Cartaya, Cheri Mossburg and Jennifer Henderson contributed to this report.",

            "Text": "(CNN)After adjusting for population, US states in the South and West continue to report the most daily coronavirus cases even after declines over the past few weeks.\n\nPer capita, Georgia has reported the most cases per day over a seven-day average of any state, followed by Texas and Florida. The states are led by governors who pushed to reopen during the spring, saw major summer surges of cases and are currently pushing to reopen schools.\nTexas has issued a mandate requiring face masks, while Florida and Georgia have not. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has gone so far as to keep cities from making stricter rules and has sued the city of Atlanta for trying to require face masks. Georgia has allowed restaurants, bars and gyms to open at limited capacity.\nA White House Coronavirus Task Force report dated August 16 and obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC) recommends that Georgia do more to fight coronavirus. The report comes as colleges are quickly learning it may be next to impossible to create a coronavirus-free environment on campus.\nAcross the US, the virus continues to spread at high rates. The seven-day average of daily new coronavirus cases in the US declined on Monday to 49,000, the first time it's been below 50,000 since July 6. Still, worldwide, that average daily total is surpassed only by India, which has four times the number of people.\nThe US's seven-day average of new deaths has been over 1,000 per day for the past 23 days. In Florida, officials reported deaths of more than 200 people in a day Tuesday -- for at least the 10th time in the past month. More than 5.5 million Americans have been infected since the start of the pandemic and at least 172,000 have died. Georgia teacher resigns over back-to-school plan 01:59\nThough conditions in some areas have improved modestly in recent weeks, the task force said Georgia remains in the red zone for severity of the outbreak as measured by rate of case growth and test positivity, the AJC reported.\n\"Georgia's small gains are fragile and statewide progress will require continued, expanded, and stronger mitigation efforts, including in all open schools,\" according to the White House report obtained by the AJC.\nThe AJC reported that the White House Coronavirus Task Force continues to recommend that Georgia close bars and gyms, restrict indoor dining at restaurants to one-quarter capacity in the highest risk counties, and limit social gatherings to 10 or fewer people, even within families.\nIn a statement to CNN, Kemp's office said the governor and Georgia Department of Health \"Urge Georgians to wear a mask, watch their distance, wash their hands, and follow public health guidelines.\"\n\"Georgia continues to make strong progress in the fight against COVID-19,\" according to the statement emailed to CNN by Kemp press secretary Cody Hall. \"Our 7-day average of new cases is down 26%, our hospitalizations are down 19%, and the 7-day average of positive tests is down to 9.4%. Georgia's transmission rate is 0.85 and testing capacity remains high but underutilized. This data is encouraging, but we cannot take our foot off the gas.\"\nMassachusetts to require flu vaccines all students\nHealth officials in Massachusetts announced Wednesday that influenza vaccines will become mandatory in the state for the majority of students 6 months and older who attend day care, pre-school, K-12 schools or higher education institutions. \"It is more important now than ever to get a flu vaccine because flu symptoms are very similar to those of COVID-19 and preventing the flu will save lives and preserve healthcare resources,\" Dr. Larry Madoff, medical director of the Massachusetts Public Health's bureau of infectious disease and laboratory sciences, said in a statement.\nStudents are expected to receive the vaccine by December 31, with the exemption of those with medical or religious reasons, homeschooled children or higher education students who are \"completely off-campus and engaged in remote learning only,\" the health department said. Massachusetts is the first state to require flu shots for children over the age of 5. All 50 states require vaccines for children to attend public schools, but according to the Immunization Action Coalition, none before now have required flu vaccines for children in kindergarten or above.\nConnecticut, New Jersey, New York City, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island require flu vaccines for children in daycare or preschool but not for older children.\nHealth officials have been urging Americans to get vaccinated against flu in an effort to avoid complicating the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\nUniversities scramble with coronavirus outbreaks\nYoung people have been returning to schools and college campuses across the country, seeding new coronavirus outbreaks.\n\"It's just extremely difficult to consider yourself to be in a bubble when there is a very high level of community spread around you or when people are coming from all over the country and congregating on college campuses,\" said Dr. Leana Wen, the former Baltimore City Health Commissioner. \"You can't keep coronavirus out.\" About a dozen colleges have reported cases on campus, with more than 100 students testing positive at University of Notre Dame, Iowa State University, UNC-Chapel Hill and the University of Kentucky.\nOutbreaks have been traced to off-campus gatherings, sororities, fraternities and dorms, leaving schools to reassess how to proceed with the fall semester.\nNorth Carolina State University, Oklahoma State University, Northeast Mississippi Community College, Western Kentucky University and East Carolina University have all reported significant numbers of cases as well.\nIn Mississippi, nearly 2,000 K-12 students and more than 300 employees have been quarantined due to possible exposure, Dr. Thomas Dobbs with the Mississippi Department of Health said at a briefing.\nAmerican Indian and Alaskan Natives hit harder by Covid-19\nThe rate of coronavirus among American Indian and Alaskan Native people is 3.5 times higher than among White people, according to a new report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The report analyzed more than 340,000 confirmed cases across 23 states between late January and early July. There were 594 Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people among American Indians and Alaska Natives, compared to 169 cases per 100,000 Whites, the report released Wednesday shows.Researchers found that cases among American Indians and Alaska Natives tended to be younger in age.\nThe report indicates that the virus incidence among American Indian and Alaskan Native people might reflect on the limited access to running water, household size and other factors that might facilitate Covid-19 community transmission.\nCNN's Maggie Fox, Jacqueline Howard, Amanda Watts, Naomi Thomas, Annie Grayer, Jamiel Lynch, Giovanna Van Leeuwen and Jennifer Henderson contributed to this report.",

            "Text": "(CNN)If the United States allowed coronavirus infections to run rampant to achieve possible herd immunity, the death toll would be massive, especially among vulnerable people, the nation's top infectious doctor said.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, explained the risks during a live Instagram session.\n\"If everyone contracted it, even with the relatively high percentage of people without symptoms ... a lot of people are going to die,\" Fauci said.\nAt least 167,298 people have died in the US from coronavirus, Johns Hopkins University reported Friday.\n\"You look at the United States of America, with our epidemic of obesity as it were. With the number of people with hypertension. With the number of people with diabetes. If everyone got infected, the death toll would be enormous and totally unacceptable,\" Fauci said.\nHerd immunity is reached when a majority of a population becomes immune to a disease either through infection and recovery or vaccination. When that happens, the disease is less likely to spread to people who aren't immune because there just aren't enough infectious carriers to reach them.\nIt is still unclear whether survivors of Covid-19 have immunity, though some have still suggested that allowing Covid-19 to plow through populations might help reach herd immunity more quickly if possible -- but it would be a disaster for hospitals. Doctors would be overwhelmed and more people would die, not just from the coronavirus but from other infections, too. A nurse at Emory Hospital takes a nasal swab at a drive-through coronavirus testing site in Conyers, Georgia.\nMeanwhile, museums and cultural institutions across New York City can open with restrictions beginning August 24, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced on Twitter Friday morning.\n\"25% occupancy. Timed ticketing required. Pre-set staggered entry,\" he posted, adding face coverings and controlled traffic flow will be enforced. California reaches a grim milestone\nThursday was the 18th consecutive day the US had more than 1,000 deaths. The US also reported another 51,000 new cases, according to Johns Hopkins University.\nCalifornia became the first state to top 600,000 cases. The White House Coronavirus Task Force blasted Georgia for its rising infection rates and urged the state to adopt a mask mandate, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution.\n\"You can't run away from the numbers,\" Fauci said. \"You can't run away from the numbers of people who've died, the number of people getting hospitalized, the surges we're seeing.\"\nDr. Tom Inglesby of Johns Hopkins said on CNN on Friday, \"It's doing very substantial damage to the country,\" urging continued use of face coverings, social distancing, and hand washing.\nTens of thousands more deaths projected\nCoronavirus has infected more than 5.2 million nationwide, according to Johns Hopkins.\nIn the next three weeks, that number will go up with a total of nearly 189,000 projected, according to an ensemble forecast published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe new projections released Thursday forecast 188,982 deaths by September 5 -- with a possible range of 181,375 to 201,431 deaths.\n\"State- and territory-level ensemble forecasts predict that the number of reported new deaths per week may increase over the next four weeks in Colorado and may decrease in Arizona, the Northern Mariana Islands, Vermont and Wyoming,\" the CDC said.\nThe prediction relies on about two dozen individual forecasts from outside institutions and researchers.\nUnlike some individual models, the CDC's ensemble forecast offers projections only about a month ahead. A previous ensemble forecast, published July 23, projected roughly 164,477 coronavirus deaths by Saturday. Georgia records highest death toll since pandemic started\nGeorgia was the first state to reopen after being one of the last ones to shut down. This week, it recorded its highest death toll.\nThe White House task force urged Georgia to mandate masks as it warned of expanding Covid-19 spread, the Atlanta newspaper reported.\nThe state reported 136 deaths Tuesday -- its most in a single day -- and an additional 109 deaths Wednesday, according to health officials. Its health department reported 2,674 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday. The virus has killed a total of 4,538 people in the state.\nAnd in North Carolina, the department of health said \"an error\" has reduced the total official count of cumulative coronavirus tests performed since the pandemic started. The number has gone down to 1,823,283 from 2,044,727, said Dr. Mandy Cohen, the state's top health official.\nThe error was due to a discrepancy between electronic and manual reporting of test data submitted by the company LabCorp. The error affected the overall number of tests previously reported but it does not change the total confirmed positive cases, the total deaths or the percent positive calculation, the department of health said.\nIn a sign the virus may be around for a while, Kansas City, Missouri, is extending its coronavirus state of emergency into the beginning of next year. Emergency orders will be in effect until at least January 16, 2021.\n\"It is now obvious to everyone that Covid-19 is not going away over the next five months,\" said Dr. Rex Archer, the director of the city's health department.\nA house party is same as visiting a bar, official says\nAs the long holiday weekend gets closer, officials are warning against social events.\nAdm. Brett Giroir, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, emphasized the need for coronavirus mitigation measures during the Labor Day weekend. He urged people to avoid crowds -- particularly in indoor spaces.\n\"We talk about bars, but if you have a house party with a hundred people in your living room, that's the same equivalent,\" he said. He described a crowd of people indoors, drinking, talking and not wearing masks as a formula for disaster.\n\"What you really need to do -- whether you're in a hot area or not -- please wear a mask,\" Giroir said.\nGood hand hygiene is also essential, he said.\nCNN's Steve Almasy, Dakin Andone, Andy Rose, Joe Sutton and Janine Mack contributed to this report.",

None of the candidate vaccines in advanced clinical trials have so far demonstrated a \"clear signal\" of efficacy at the level of at least 50% sought by the WHO, spokeswoman Margaret Harris said last week.\n\n\"In terms of realistic timelines, we are really not expecting to see widespread vaccination until the middle of next year,\" she added.\n\nSimilar sentiments have been shared by Thomas Cueni, director-general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers. The industry body represents the companies that signed the pledge.\n\n\"I think it's fairly unlikely that we will have a vaccine approved or in particular distributed at large scale before the end of this year,\" he told the BBC. \"We may be surprised but clearly the manufacturers do not want speed above quality\".\n\nDespite this, China and Russia have begun inoculating some key workers with domestically developed vaccines. All of them are still listed by the WHO as being in clinical trials.\n\nMeanwhile, the US national regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has suggested that coronavirus vaccines may be approved before completing a third phase of clinical trials. This phase can often involve thousands of participants and last several years.\n\nShort cuts and 'dirty tricks' in the scramble for a vaccine\nHow will the world vaccinate seven billion people?\nLast week it also emerged that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had urged states to consider waiving certain requirements in order to be ready to distribute a potential vaccine by 1 November - two days before the 3 November presidential election.\n\nPresident Trump has hinted that a vaccine might be available before the election. But his Democratic rival Joe Biden has expressed scepticism that Mr Trump will listen to scientists and implement a transparent process.",

            "Text": "Madagascar attracted a lot of attention in April when the African island nation announced it was using a local plant to combat coronavirus.\nA drink using artemisia plant extracts was promoted by its leader, President Andry Rajoelina.\nThere's no evidence so far that this plant - whose compounds do work against malaria - can combat Covid-19, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). \nSo what do we know about the plant and its properties?\nWhere does the plant come from?\nArtemisia annua is originally from Asia, but grows in many other parts of the world with sunny and warm conditions.\nIt's been used in Chinese traditional medicine for more than 2,000 years for treating a number of diseases, including malaria, as well as to relieve pain and combat fever. In Chinese medicine, it is known as \"qinghao.\"  \nIt is also called sweet wormwood or annual wormwood, and is used as an alternative therapy - and even put into some alcoholic drinks.\nCould artemisia work against Covid-19?\nPresident Rajoelina of Madagascar said in April this year that trials conducted on the Covid-Organics drink - which uses artemisia - showed its effectiveness against the disease. He repeated this claim in September.\nBut no evidence has been shown publicly for this.\nLive tracker: Coronavirus in Africa\nAnd the exact composition of the drink is not known, although the government says more than 60% is derived from the artemisia plant.\nMadagascar has also started producing capsules and a solution that can be injected, on which clinical trials have begun. German and Danish scientists have been testing extracts from artemisia annua plants, which they say showed some effectiveness against the new coronavirus in a laboratory setting.\nThe research - which hasn't been independently reviewed by other scientists - found that these extracts showed anti-viral activity when used with pure ethanol or distilled water.\nThese researchers are working with the University of Kentucky to carry out human clinical trials at some stage.\nChina has been conducting its own tests, based on traditional medicines that use the artemisia annua plant.\nAnd scientists in South Africa have been doing laboratory tests on artemisia annua and another variety of the plant - artemisia afra - for effectiveness against Covid-19. But there are no results as yet.\nWhat does the WHO say about artemisia?\nThe WHO says it hasn't yet had detailed information about the Madagascar tests.\nJean-Baptiste Nikiema of the WHO's Africa region told the BBC the organisation may get involved later on in trials - depending on what information they get about the early trials.\nAt the moment, the WHO says there is no evidence that artemisia-derived products work against Covid-19.\nIt adds that all medicinal plants \"should be tested for efficacy and adverse side-effects\" through rigorous clinical trials.\nHow is it used against malaria?\nThe active ingredient found in the dried leaves of artemisia annua is called artemisinin, and it does work against malaria.\nChinese scientists pioneered the discovery of its properties when they were searching for a cure for malaria in the 1970s. Artemisinin-based combination therapies - known for short as ACTs - are recommended by the WHO against malaria, especially those types now resistant to chloroquine, which is one of the main drug treatments for the disease.\nACTs contain derivatives of artemisinin combined with other substances, and these reduce the number of malaria parasites in the body.\nIncreased access to ACTs in malaria-endemic countries has been cited as a key factor in helping reduce the global toll of the disease in the last 15 years.\nWhat are the risks of drug resistance?\nBecause artemisia annua extracts have started appearing more widely as remedies for malaria, such as in tea, there's concern that unregulated usage could allow the malaria parasite to develop resistance. There are a number of countries in south-east Asia where this resistance has already been observed.\n\"We know that over time the [malaria] parasite will start to resist, but this time [period] needs to be as long as possible,\" says Jean-Baptiste Nikiema of the WHO.\nThe WHO now discourages the use of non-pharmaceutical forms of artemisinin, concerned that it could lead to growing malarial resistance.",

            "Text": "Nearly a third of people should still be working from homes, even when coronavirus restrictions have eased, says the Welsh Government.\n\nMinisters said its ambition is to see about 30% of the workforce in Wales staying at or near home in the long term.\n\nThey said it was a chance to adopt culture that \"supports remote working\".\n\nThe move could reduce congestion and pollution, and improve work-life balance, they argue.\n\n\"The UK government instruction for everyone to go back to the office is not one we are repeating in Wales,\" said Deputy Minister for Transport and Economy, Lee Waters.\n\n\"We believe many people will want to continue to work remotely in the longer term and this could be a step-change in the way we work in Wales.\"\n\nWhy I hate working from home\nWhat does my boss do to keep me safe?\nWorking from home: How to cut your tax bill\nThe Welsh Government said it wanted to give workers \"more flexibility to work remotely\" and claimed this could \"drive regeneration and economic activity in communities\".\n\nThe ministers also suggested it would recognise \"the importance of learning lessons on issues such as mental health support, childcare arrangements and more innovative housing design\". As part of its policy, officials said they were exploring how to develop a network of \"community-based working hubs\".\n\nThe hubs would be office-like environments within walking or cycling distance of homes, and shared by public, private and voluntary bodies.\n\n\"The intention is to develop a hybrid workplace model, where staff can work in the office, at home, or in a hub location,\" stated Welsh Government officials. A recent report by academics at Cardiff and Southampton universities suggested the majority of people working from home are as productive as those working in office bases, if not more productive.\n\nThe Understanding Society Covid-19 Study also said nine out of 10 those who had worked from home during lockdown would like to continue in some form.\n\nThe UK government has pushed for people to return to office, with a campaign asking employers to reassure staff it is safe to return by highlighting measures taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19.\n\nThe employers' organisation the CBI has warned city centres could become \"ghost towns\" if the prime minister does not do more to encourage staff back, with businesses relying on passing trade from office workers.\n\nHowever, there has been suggestions that the shift could conversely boost local neighbourhoods and independent businesses.\n\nLast week, the new chief executive of Wales' largest building society, Principality, said home working has been so successful many staff would not return to the office.\n\nJulie-Ann Haines said: \"Colleagues have demonstrated they can be as productive, and in some cases more productive, working from home than they were in the office\".\n\n'Get the balance right'\nWales TUC general secretary Shavanah Taj said there were \"real benefits but some other concerns\" with some workers saying home-working had had an effect on their mental health, along with fewer breaks and less socialising.\n\n\"We do need to get the balance right,\" she said.\n\nMs Taj said more home-working could also affect jobs in the hospitality sector which was \"built around office spaces\", adding that her organisation was working with the government to mitigate the risks.\n\n\"We do really need to think what is going to happen there,\" she said.\n\nThe Deputy Minister for Housing and Local Government, Hannah Blythyn added: \"Home working will change how we use our town centres and high streets.\n\n\"As part of our work to support and revitalise our high streets and town centres we will be asking organisations, businesses and individuals to contribute to a major piece of work aimed at ensuring more people are living, working, shopping and learning there.\"",

            "Text": "Social gatherings of more than six people will be illegal in England from Monday - with some exemptions - amid a steep rise in coronavirus cases.\n\nThe law change will ban larger groups meeting anywhere socially indoors or outdoors, the government said.\n\nBut it will not apply to schools, workplaces or Covid-secure weddings, funerals and organised team sports.\n\nIt will be enforced through a \u00a3100 fine if people fail to comply, doubling on each offence up to a maximum of \u00a33,200.\n\nThe new rules - which come into force on 14 September - mark a change to England's current guidance.\n\nAt present, the guidance says two households of any size are allowed to meet indoors or outdoors, or up to six people from different households outdoors. Until now the police have had no powers to stop gatherings unless they exceeded 30.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson will give further details of the changes at a Downing Street news conference at 16:00 BST on Wednesday, alongside senior advisers Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance.\n\nWhat are the new rules for meeting my friends?\nFive reasons rise in Covid cases is not all it seems\n\"One of the pieces of feedback we had including from the police was that we needed the rules to be super simple so that everybody knows what they are,\" said Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast: \"This is really simple. Gatherings are ok, they should be socially distanced of course, but groups only of up to six.\"\n\nHe said it means that some families will not be able to see both grandparents at the same time. \"You know, I have three children,\" he said. \"We have a family of five. And so we'll be able to see one other person at a time, as a whole family.\"\n\nChallenged on whether the new rules could stop grandparents helping out with childcare, Mr Hancock said: \"I'm not actively trying to do that\".\n\nBut he said the government is \"quite worried about\" the \"very serious problem\" of children potentially passing on the virus to older grandparents.\n\n'Hope to turn it around by Christmas'\nMatt Hancock said the rules would be in place for the \"foreseeable future\".\n\n\"I really hope we can turn this round before Christmas. I think that, in a pandemic, Christmas is a long way off,\" he told BBC Radio 4.\n\n\"Three months is a long time in a pandemic and I very much hope this strong rule, together with the local action we've taken in places like Bolton... I very much hope therefore this can work to do that by Christmas.\" Mr Hancock was also asked about testing, after people with symptoms struggled to access testing in recent days.\n\n\"Unfortunately we have seen this quite sharp rise in the last couple of weeks of people without symptoms who don't have a good reason coming forward and getting a test,\" he said, saying 25% of people who were getting a coronavirus test were not eligible.\n\n\"I've even heard stories of people saying 'I'm going on holiday next week therefore I'm going to go get a test'. No. That's not what the testing system is there for.\"\n\nAt-a-glance: What are the new rules?\nSocial gatherings of more than six people in England will not be allowed in law from Monday 14 September\nThe new rule applies to people in private homes, indoors and outdoors, and places such as pubs, restaurants, cafes and public outdoor spaces\nIt applies to all ages\nThe rule does not apply to schools and workplaces, or weddings, funerals and organised team sports\nA full list of exemptions is due to be published before the law changes\nPeople who ignore police could be fined \u00a3100 - doubling with each offence to a maximum of \u00a33,200\nProfessor Sir Jeremy Farrar, who sits on the government's scientific advisory committee, said the next four to six weeks \"will be absolutely pivotal to the sort of autumn and winter we have\".\n\n\"So I am very supportive of the restrictions coming in and sincerely hope they are going to be enough.\"\n\nLaura Kuenssberg: The government's warning system is flashing red\nUK coronavirus cases up by 2,460 - check the numbers in your area\nThere are some exceptions to the new rules. Households and support bubbles bigger than six can socialise together - but not with anyone else at the same time - and gatherings can be more than six if it is for work or education purposes.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said the new rules did not affect places of worship as that is \"not a social gathering\".\n\nAnd Parkrun - which earlier this week announced it was to resume in England - is \"unaffected\" as it is an organised sport, its organisers said.\n\nNo 10 said any group of seven or more people gathering anywhere \"risks being dispersed by police or fined for non-compliance\".\n\nBBC political correspondent Nick Eardley pointed out that pubs and restaurants would be allowed to have more than six customers inside, but that the groups of six would have to be socially distant from each other.\n\nThe rationale behind allowing this, but not allowing larger groups of people inside other people's homes, is that businesses can only be open if they follow safety and hygiene measures set out by the government, he added.\n\nDowning Street said Mr Johnson held a virtual roundtable with police forces last week, and heard officers wanted clearer rules and enforcement on social contact. The devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are able to set their own coronavirus restrictions and, while largely implementing similar rules, have moved at their own pace during the pandemic.\n\nThe number of people allowed to meet inside or outside varies in the UK's four nations. If you are meeting indoors: up to eight people from three different households can meet in Scotland; up to six people from two households in Northern Ireland; up to four households can form an \"extended household\" in Wales. Ministers and government advisers earlier expressed concern over a \"sharp rise\" in cases and a \"heartfelt\" apology was issued following shortages in England's testing system.\n\nOverall, there have been 8,396 new cases reported since Sunday - with 2,460 reported on Tuesday alone.\n\nThere were also 32 deaths reported, but these will not have been related to the most recent rise in cases. The banning of gatherings of over six people is partly about solving a specific problem - giving police powers to crackdown on large gatherings.\n\nIt also provides ministers and officials the opportunity to warn the public against complacency with signs infections may be on the rise.\n\nBut what is more important is where the UK goes from here.\n\nLockdown bought us time, but has essentially only deferred the problem - how to protect people, particularly the most vulnerable, from the virus while keeping society functioning.\n\nBetter treatments, more testing and a network of contact tracers has put the UK in a better position than it was in the spring - even though there are problems with the last two.\n\nFurther restrictions of more or less any sort come at a cost - whether to health, education, the economy or all three.\n\nIt means the UK, like all nations, is faced with the impossibly difficult task of balancing harms.\n\nWith winter around the corner - the time when respiratory viruses thrive - the decisions are just going to become even more difficult.\n\nThe UK government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, who No 10 said backed urgent action in England, has said Covid-19 rates are now rising, especially among people between the ages of 17 and 29.\n\nHe warned that if people stopped social distancing then \"Covid comes back\".\n\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van Tam has also voiced concern saying: \"People have relaxed too much. Now is the time for us to re-engage, and to realise that this is a continuing threat to us.\"\n\nIn other developments:\n\nBusinesses in England that are required to close because of coronavirus restrictions will be able to claim \u00a31,500 per property every three weeks, the Treasury announced. But the British Chambers of Commerce said for most \"this will not be enough to offset the resulting cash crunch\"\nA new public information campaign will be launched across the UK reminding people of the \"basics\" - washing their hands, covering their face and giving others space\nDoncaster Racecourse has been told by public health officials to stop spectators attending its meeting from Thursday. More than 2,500 spectators are expected there on Wednesday\nThe quarantine rule on travellers coming into England from seven Greek islands came into force at 04:00 on Wednesday\nLockdown measures are being reintroduced in Bolton, Greater Manchester, after a local rise in cases. It includes a ban on people socialising with people outside their own household in any setting, even outdoors\nThe first clinical trials for a coronavirus vaccine at Oxford University have been put on hold after a participant had an adverse reaction.",

            "Text": "Russian scientists have published the first report on their coronavirus vaccine, saying early tests showed signs of an immune response.\nThe report published by medical journal The Lancet said every participant developed antibodies to fight the virus and had no serious side effects.\nRussia licensed the vaccine for local use in August, the first country to do so and before data had been published.\nExperts say the trials were too small to prove effectiveness and safety.\nBut Moscow has hailed the results as an answer to critics. Some Western experts have raised concerns about the speed of Russia's work, suggesting that researchers might be cutting corners.\nLast month, President Vladimir Putin said the vaccine had passed all the required checks and that one of his own daughters had been given it.\nWhat does the report say?\nTwo trials of the vaccine, named Sputnik-V, were conducted between June and July, The Lancet paper said. Each involved 38 healthy volunteers who were given a dose of the vaccine and then a booster vaccine three weeks later.\nThe participants - aged between 18 and 60 - were monitored for 42 days and all of them developed antibodies within three weeks. Among the most common side effects were headaches and joint pain.\nThe trials were open label and not randomised, meaning there was no placebo and the volunteers were aware they were receiving the vaccine.\n\"Large, long-term trials including a placebo comparison, and further monitoring are needed to establish the long-term safety and effectiveness of the vaccine for preventing Covid-19 infection,\" the report said.\nRussia rejects mounting Covid-19 vaccine concerns\nRussia plans mass vaccination for October\nA third phase of trials will involve 40,000 volunteers from \"different age and risk groups,\" according to the paper.\nThe Russian vaccine uses adapted strains of the adenovirus, a virus that usually causes the common cold, to trigger an immune response.\nline\nStill a long way to go\nBy Philippa Roxby, BBC health reporter\n\"Encouraging\" and \"so far so good\" are some of the reactions from scientists in the UK - but there is still, clearly, a long way to go. Although the vaccine showed an antibody response in all participants in phase 2, this does not necessarily mean it would protect them from the virus. That still has not been established yet.\nFrom these results, we can tell that the vaccine appeared to be safe in healthy people between the age of 18 and 60 for 42 days, because that was how long the study lasted. But what about older people and those with underlying health conditions who are most at risk of Covid-19 - how safe is it for them and over a longer period of time?\nThis can only be answered after much larger, long-term randomised trials where the people taking part do not know if they are receiving the vaccine or a dummy injection. These will also tell scientists how effective the vaccine really is among a much wider population.\nThere have also been calls for openness and transparency. Of the many vaccines currently being trialled around the world, some will work better than others in certain situations and in certain groups of people, perhaps. So knowing exactly how well they work and for whom is paramount - it is unlikely that one vaccine will be suitable for everyone.\nline\nWhat has the reaction been?\nKirill Dmitriev, head of a Russian investment fund behind the vaccine, said during a news conference that the report was \"a powerful response to the sceptics who unreasonably criticised the Russian vaccine\".\nHe said that 3,000 people had already been recruited for the next phase of trials.\nRussian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said the country would start vaccinations from November or December, with a focus on high-risk groups. But experts warned that there was still a long way to go until a vaccine could enter the market.\nBrendan Wen, Professor of Microbial Pathogenesis at London's School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told Reuters news agency: \"The report is a case of 'so far, so good'\".\nAccording to the World Health Organization, there are 176 potential vaccines currently being developed worldwide. Of those, 34 are currently being tested on people. Among those, eight are at stage three, the most advanced.",

            "Text": "The main test used to diagnose coronavirus is so sensitive it could be picking up fragments of dead virus from old infections, scientists say.\n\nMost people are infectious only for about a week, but could test positive weeks afterwards.\n\nResearchers say this could be leading to an over-estimate of the current scale of the pandemic.\n\nBut some experts say it is uncertain how a reliable test can be produced that doesn't risk missing cases.\n\nProf Carl Heneghan, one of the study's authors, said instead of giving a \"yes/no\" result based on whether any virus is detected, tests should have a cut-off point so that very small amounts of virus do not trigger a positive result.\n\nHe believes the detection of traces of old virus could partly explain why the number of cases is rising while hospital admissions remain stable.\n\nThe University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine reviewed the evidence from 25 studies where virus specimens from positive tests were put in a petri dish to see whether they would grow.\n\nThis method of \"viral culturing\" can indicate whether the positive test has picked up active virus which can reproduce and spread, or just dead virus fragments which won't grow in the lab, or in a person. This is a problem we have known about since the start - and once again illustrates why data on Covid is far from perfect.\n\nBut what difference does it make? When the virus first emerged probably very little, but the longer the pandemic goes on the bigger the effect.\n\nThe flurry of information about testing and the R number creates confusion.\n\nBut however we cut it, the fact remains there are very low levels of infection in the UK overall, lower than a number of other European countries.\n\nWhere there are local outbreaks the system - by and large - seems to be having success in curbing them.\n\nAnd this comes after the opening up of society over the summer.\n\nOf course, the big question is what happens next, with schools back and winter around the corner.\n\nThere is a growing sense within the public health community that the UK is in a strong position - and certainly a return to the high levels of infection seen in the spring should be avoided.\n\nBut there is also extreme caution and an understandable desire for complacency not to creep in.\n\nHow is Covid diagnosed?\nThe PCR swab test - the standard diagnostic method - uses chemicals to amplify the virus's genetic material so that it can be studied.\n\nYour test sample has to go through a number of \"cycles\" in the lab before enough virus is recovered.\n\nJust how many can indicate how much of the virus is there - whether it's tiny fragments or lots of whole virus.\n\nThis in turn appears to be linked to how likely the virus is to be infectious - tests that have to go through more cycles are less likely to reproduce when cultured in the lab.\n\nFalse positive risk\nBut when you take a coronavirus test, you get a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. There is no indication of how much virus was in the sample, or how likely it is to be an active infection.\n\nA person shedding a large amount of active virus, and a person with leftover fragments from an infection that's already been cleared, would receive the same - positive - test result.\n\nBut Prof Heneghan, the academic who spotted a quirk in how deaths were being recorded, which led Public Health England to reform its system, says evidence suggests coronavirus \"infectivity appears to decline after about a week\".\n\nHe added that while it would not be possible to check every test to see whether there was active virus, the likelihood of false positive results could be reduced if scientists could work out where the cut-off point should be.\n\nThis could prevent people being given a positive result based on an old infection. And Prof Heneghan said that would stop people quarantining or being contact-traced unnecessarily, and give a better understanding of the current scale of the pandemic.\n\nPublic Health England agreed viral cultures were a useful way of assessing the results of coronavirus tests and said it had recently undertaken analysis along these lines.\n\nIt said it was working with labs to reduce the risk of false positives, including looking at where the \"cycle threshold\", or cut-off point, should be set.\n\nBut it said there were many different test kits in use, with different thresholds and ways of being read, which made providing a range of cut-off points difficult.\n\nBut Prof Ben Neuman, at the University of Reading, said culturing virus from a patient sample was \"not trivial\".\n\n\"This review runs the risk of falsely correlating the difficulty of culturing Sars-CoV-2 from a patient sample, with likelihood that it will spread,\" he said.\n\nProf Francesco Venturelli, an epidemiologist in the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, which was hit hard by the virus in March, said there was \"not enough certainty\" about how long virus remains infectious during the recovering period.\n\nSome studies based on viral cultures reported about 10% of patients still had viable virus after eight days, he said.\n\nIn Italy, which had its peak earlier than the UK, \"for several weeks we were over-estimating cases\" because of people who acquired the infection several weeks before they were identified as positive.\n\nBut, as you move away from the peak, this phenomenon diminishes. Prof Peter Openshaw at Imperial College London said PCR was a highly sensitive \"method of detecting residual viral genetic material\".\n\n\"This is not evidence of infectivity,\" he said. But the clinical consensus was that patients were \"very unlikely to be infectious beyond day 10 of disease\".\n\nFollow Rachel on Twitter",

Mr Drakeford said the \"hotspot areas\" of Caerphilly county, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taff were being monitored closely to see if further action was needed to prevent the ongoing spread of coronavirus.\n\nThe first minister said it was important people carried on working from home if they could.\n\nMasks not \"some sort of magic wand\"\nMr Drakeford told the BBC the rate of 20 people in 100,000 was the \"threshold we use for people to have to quarantine coming back into the UK\".\n\nHe said if that figure fell, the advice on face masks could be looked at again.\n\nThe new mask rule would come in from Monday to give people time to buy one, he said.\n\nMasks were not \"some sort of magic wand\" but \"a sensible addition to the precautionary measures we are taking\" to avert a crisis. Mr Drakeford said masks would not be mandatory in workplaces and said wearing them in school did \"not seem proportionate.\"\n\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the announcement \"was very welcome\" though the evidence on them was \"never going to be 100%.\"\n\nConservative Member of the Senedd, Darren Millar, said on Twitter his party had been calling for mandatory masks in shops since early July: \"On Wednesday we tabled a debate in the Welsh Parliament. Today, the Welsh Labour-led Government finally act.\" The Federation of Small Businesses said it hoped the new mask rules would \"provide reassurance\" to shoppers.\n\nBut it joined the shop workers union USDAW in urging customers to continue treating staff with respect.\n\n'No immediate return to normal shopping'\n\"The move to make wearing face coverings mandatory is further proof there will be no immediate return to normal shopping,\" said Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium.\n\nThose working in towns and city centres have broadly welcomed the move to avoid another full lockdown.\n\n\"Businesses just need to know what they have to do to be able to open up and trade,\" said Kevin Ward, manager of the Newport Now business improvement district.\n\n\"Certain regulations have changed through the pandemic but what nobody wants is to have to go into a full lockdown again. For a lot of independent businesses and [chain stores], they would not survive another lockdown,\" he said. Neil Butler, of teachers' union NASUWT, said he was worried about schools: \"The Welsh Government is positively saying no, we do not want face coverings in those particular environments.\"\n\nCases 'linked to people socialising indoors'\nMinisters said the restrictions on people meeting followed an increase in cases linked to people socialising indoors.\n\nUp to four households have been able to form an extended household and meet since late August. Until now, there has been no legal limit on how many people could gather.\n\nMr Drakeford said the rule of up to 30 people being allowed to meet outdoors would include peoples' gardens.\n\nBubble trouble? What can you now do in lockdown?\nNew rules 'no longer than we have to' - Hancock\nFiguring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales\nChildren aged under 11 are not included in the six.\n\nThe new rules on meeting indoors will not apply in Caerphilly county borough, which was put under local lockdown on Tuesday, where all extended household meetings are currently banned inside. The move comes after other parts of the UK also restricted meetings to six - but did so both indoors and outdoors.\n\nThe UK government is restricting gatherings in England to just six people from Monday, with some exceptions. The number of people that can meet in Scotland has also been cut to six. Wales' coronavirus rules mean people can only be part of a single extended household, which cannot be changed once arranged.\n\nDespite the gradual easing of restrictions over the summer, meetings indoors with anyone outside your extended household have remained illegal.\n\nOne of UK's highest infection rates\nThe recent rise in cases seen in Caerphilly county was blamed on people socialising in other people's homes in large numbers.\n\nThe area has seen one of the highest rates of cases in the whole of the UK, with 91.1 cases per 100,000 people over seven days.\n\nOn Thursday, residents of Rhondda Cynon Taff and Merthyr Tydfil were asked to follow a range of measures to avoid a local lockdown.",

How long will it take me to recover?\nElly MacDonald, 37, from Surbiton, was training for the London Marathon when she first developed what she believes were Covid symptoms on 21 March.\n\nMore than five months on, she still suffers from breathlessness and extreme fatigue, but has not received a positive test result - because community testing was re-introduced too late for it to detect her illness.\n\nShe changed her GP practice after initially feeling she was not being helped,\n\nElly said: \"Just knowing that I actually have people who are taking me seriously - that's been very important for my recovery. I just want my life back.\" Paul Garner, a professor at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, has had long Covid since 19 March, and feels some patients are not being believed by healthcare professionals.\n\n\"I think the proof is in the symptoms and the stage that we're at in the epidemic,\" he said.\n\n\"We need sensible guidelines that really help people. The government is simply not doing enough with the existing medical expertise. It needs to be commandeered and brought together to work together.\"\n\nFile on 4 asked all 212 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) and health boards across the UK whether they had set up post-Covid clinics for patients who were not admitted to hospital with the virus - but did not necessarily receive a positive test result.\n\nOf the 86 that responded, 10 said they were already running such facilities. A further 16 said they were planning or redesigning services.\n\nMany patients will be seen by their GP, or existing services. Martin Marshall, GP and chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: \"Without doubt, we know that there's going to be a growing number of people who have significant and worrying symptoms of long Covid.\n\n\"A small proportion, but in total a large number, will require specialist advice.\n\n\"So we really do need to see a growing number of post-Covid clinics being established.\"\n\nNHS England's new Your Covid Recovery website offers personalised support for all patients recovering from Covid.\n\nLynne Turner Stokes, professor of rehabilitation medicine at King's College London, said it had some \"good resources\" but that \"we have to do much more\".\n\nShe said: \"For people who have never been to hospital, nobody's looked properly at their lungs, their hearts and so on.\n\n\"It will be very useful if we had more one stop (face to face) services.\"\n\nPerson-centred rehab\nThe UK government and NHS England say there will be new and strengthened rehab centres and community services in every part of the country.\n\nIn Wales, community and specialist rehabilitation programmes are likely to be the forum for offering Covid care.\n\nThe Department of Health in Northern Ireland says it is assessing the needs of Covid patients who have left hospital to highlight future work, while Scotland is planning to provide \"high quality person-centred rehabilitation in different settings",

            "Text": "Dentists are \"firefighting\" to deal with a \"huge backlog\" and will not catch up until 2021, the Welsh general practitioners committee chairman said.\n\nTom Bysouth also warned many of Wales' 500 surgeries were facing the threat of redundancies or even closure.\n\nHe said untreated fillings could make teeth irreparable with signs of mouth cancer not being picked up.\n\nThe British Dental Association called for support, saying if practices fail, patients will have \"nowhere to go\".\n\n\"It will take a long time to catch up. Effectively, if we were acting in normal circumstances, it would take at least another six months,\" Mr Bysouth said.\n\nDentists' plea to reopen surgeries in Wales\nProtective equipment issues risk to Welsh dentists\n\"We're prioritising the more urgent care - but as an example, I took four people off our fillings list yesterday, and put three on.\n\n\"If it stays the same, it won't be in 2020 we catch up, but 2021. We are chasing the tail.\" Mr Bysouth is also concerned that, with people not having routine check-ups, signs of mouth cancer may be missed and fillings will get worse, making teeth irreparable.\n\n\"Before lockdown, a typical practice with three dentists would see around 60 to 80 people a day, but that dramatically reduced over lockdown in order to comply with social distancing measures,\" he said. Some had been seeing as few as 10 a day when they reopened because of Welsh Government rules around ventilating surgeries.\n\nBut new guidelines that came into effect in August meant a new patient can now be seen every 20 minutes not every hour, greatly increasing the number. Mr Bysouth estimates there are about 500 practices in Wales, the vast majority of which carry out a mixture of NHS and private work.\n\nHowever, with government financial support only available for NHS work, he believed those that did less of it were in a \"precarious\" position.\n\nHe said: \"There is a risk some may have to close, let staff go or reduce their hours. Like any business model, it needs to be viable. They are as vulnerable as any business.\n\n\"People already face a 90-minute round trip in parts of Wales and 15% of practices are taking on new patients. And this was pre-Covid.\" 'I need three teeth out'\n\nMaxine Bullock, from Llantrisant, is hoping to finally have teeth out in October after waiting in \"horrendous\" pain for more than six months.\n\n\"My appointment was due three days after lockdown. I now need three teeth out not two... and for the last three months its been terrible,\" she said.\n\n\"Every time I ring, it goes to the end of the next month.\"\n\nSue O'Connor, from Welshpool, has been waiting since last October to have a wisdom tooth removed, but lockdown has caused even more delay.\n\n\"The tooth they were trying to save is now broken with half missing,\" she said. Melanie Goodridge, from Fishguard, said: \"I have a broken tooth and it's sharp and cutting my tongue and I can't eat and can just about swallow. They told me to call back in three weeks.\"\n\nThe BDA estimates during lockdown patients seen on the NHS fell by as much as 98% and with practices paid for each one treated, for many this makes it \"impossible to stay afloat\" without help.\n\n\"NHS practices have been offered support,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\n\"But most practices are mixed - doing both private and NHS work. There's been no meaningful help for private practice.\n\n\"If these practices fail, their patients have nowhere to go.\"\n\n'Generous package'\nThe BDA called for rates holidays for private dentists, the same enjoyed by other businesses, and said the end of the furlough scheme would be a \"a major challenge\" for them as they are operate at \"a fraction of capacity\".\n\nA Welsh Government spokesman said it had created the most generous support package in the UK to help businesses, but added: \"It is clear the UK government needs to step up and provide additional funding to help businesses through this pandemic.\"\n\nThe UK Treasury said its furlough and self-employment support schemes had protected dental jobs, and added that firms would get a \u00a31,000 bonus for each member of staff retained.",

            "Text": "(CNN)Plasma Technologies LLC has signed a defense contract worth $750,000 to develop scaled-up Covid-19 convalescent plasma technologies, according to an announcement on the Department of Defense website Monday.\n\nIt's the latest development in the effort to use a 19th century treatment to help 21st century patients.\nThe contract with the DoD's Joint Acquisition Task Force is to develop a new convalescent blood plasma process that makes more serum-derived products, and faster.\nPresident Donald Trump and US health leaders have done a full court press to encourage people who survived Covid-19 to donate plasma to help those who are sick.\nTwo weeks ago, on a tour of the Red Cross, Trump implored people to volunteer to donate plasma \"as soon as you can.\"\n\"We have a lot of people that would heal, would get better. As soon as you can, please,\" Trump said.\nWhile nearly 67,000 people have been infused with the treatment and nearly 14,000 physicians are using it, according to UScovidplasma.org, it's still not clear if it works. Several studies are under way.\nA Victorian solution to a modern problem?\nConvalescent plasma is a treatment created out of blood from people who have recovered from an infection such as Covid-19. Plasma is the liquid portion of blood containing immune cells and antibodies -- proteins the body makes to fight infection. The plasma can be infused into a sick person to help recovery.\nSince the Victorian era, doctors have used this treatment to fight severe cases of the flu. The treatment has also shown success with two other deadly coronaviruses - MERS and SARS. Yet it will take studies to prove that it works to treat Covid-19. Absent other treatments, doctors have opted to use the treatment as it was still being studied.\nDoctors try the old treatment\nWhen the Covid-19 pandemic hit New York City hard in March, doctors desperate to save patients weren't sure what might help. Plasma from recovered Covid-19 patients showed some early promise. For professionals used to relying on scientific evidence and established facts, there was -- and still is -- little to work with. \"It was sort of like learning to fly the plane when we were in midair,\" Dr. Nicole Bouvier, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Sinai, said. \"There are basic things that you know about human physiology, but you don't necessarily know how this particular virus is going to behave and what the best treatments are,\" she said.\n\"We probably changed what we were doing on a daily basis.\"\nTo see what worked, Bouvier and team did a retrospective analysis on data collected from 39 patients.\nEven in that small group, convalescent plasma stood out.\nBouvier published the results in a small pre-print study, meaning it isn't peer reviewed yet, in May. Patients treated with convalescent plasma improved more than those who were not transfused, and more patients survived. \"We don't have definitive answers yet, but we are on the way to getting definitive answers and, I would say, that the evidence, while imperfect, is promising,\" Bouvier said.\nDr. Janet Woodcock, who's heading up the therapeutic efforts under Operation Warp Speed as the director of the US Food and Drug Administration's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, recently called vaccines the \"permanent hope,\" but she said vaccines are not the only approach that will get this country out of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nConvalescent plasma, Woodcock said, is an option that can be \"feasible fairly quickly.\" Woodcock, said it's a treatment the government is trying to accelerate, even before the government knows if it works.\nEarly results in China\nEarly on, a handful of small studies in China looked promising.\nA small study published in JAMA in March showed four of five patients given convalescent plasma improved. A second small study of 10 Chinese patients published in May in the journal PNAS saw improvement in patients treated with convalescent plasma, with no safety issues. Two other small pre-print studies from China showed similar results. One additional observational study from Chinese researchers published in June did not see an improvement in the mortality rate among six critically ill patients, but the authors did not dismiss convalescent plasma completely. Instead, they suggested it may work if patients were treated earlier.\nTrying the treatment in the US\nThe US Food and Drug Admnistration has not yet approved its use for the treatment of Covid-19, but at the end of March, the FDA created a pathway for scientists to try convalescent plasma with patients and study its impact.\nDoctors at Houston Methodist immediately performed what it says were the nation's first plasma transfusions. They published their results in the American Journal of Pathology in May.\nAmong 25 hospitalized patients with Covid-19, seven days after the convalescent plasma treatment, nine showed some improvement and seven were discharged from the hospital. By day 14, 19 had improved and 11 were discharged. There were no safety issues.\nStill, it's not clear if the treatment was the reason these patients improved; the study results would need to be reproduced in a larger group of patients. As evidence mounted that it had shown some success, the FDA put out a call in April to urge recovered patients to donate plasma. The government launched a website instructing Americans on how they could donate, as did the American Red Cross.\nFirst 'maybe,' then 'possibly,' now 'probably'\nIn June, a larger study of 5,000 hospitalized patients published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation showed that the treatment was safe.\nDr. Arturo Casadevall, one of the researchers, called convalescent plasma the \"good news story\" of the pandemic.\nThe chief of molecular microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Casadevall thought the practice held promise and helped spearhead the national push to understand if this therapy works in March, when he and a colleague wrote about its possibilities in the Journal of Clinical Investigation and created the National Covid-19 Convalescent Plasma Project. It's a national network of providers at 57 institutions in 46 states. More than 100 people joined the group's first conference call. The organization quickly published a guidebook of convalescent plasma best practices for physicians. It created a website collecting the latest science. The physicians started clinical trials. One that's underway looks at the impact of the treatment on health care workers. Another is looking at the effect of convalescent plasma on patients who have not been hospitalized.\n\"When we first started this effort if you had asked 'do you think it's going to work?' I would have said 'maybe,'\" Casadevall said. \"Since then I progressed to 'possibly,' and now, I am at 'probably.'\" Casadevall wants more research to prove it works.\n\"To really be certain you need to complete the randomized clinical trials,\" Casadevall said. \"But the good thing has been that there have been multiple reports that have been encouraging, including my clinical trials from Wuhan that had to be stopped prematurely.\"\nThat trial was stopped when the flood of patients slowed to a trickle and there weren't enough patients to test the therapy.\nThe challenges\nThe number of cases can also impact how much of the therapy is available. Unlike with a monoclonal antibody therapies that can be made in the lab, this treatment relies on volunteers.\n\"It is a limited resource,\" Woodcock said Monday. That's why there has been a concerted push to get more donors. Even Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson has been enlisted to urge people to donate. Typically, one donor's plasma can treat two or three people and the original donor can come back and donate again within a couple of weeks.\nBut there are only so many donors, Woodcock said, and scientists are starting to think there is only a month-long window in which people have enough antibodies in their blood to help someone else fight the disease. But again, they need more research to know for sure.\nAn August study of 35,000 patients that has not yet been peer reviewed found that giving people the plasma treatment early seemed to reduce deaths more. People who got the transfusions within three days of diagnosis had a seven-day death rate of 8.7%, while patients treated four or more days into the course of illness had a 11.9% mortality rate.\nBut there was no placebo group. Without that comparison, it's hard to know if the treatment made the difference. The treatment be a difficult one to get right. Monoclonal antibody treatments, by contrast, are made by scientists in the lab. They pick the antibody that works best in the lab to neutralize the virus and reproduce it in the lab. Such Covid-19 antibody therapies are in clinical trials now, too.\nWith convalescent plasma, patients get all the antibodies in that plasma, not just those carefully engineered to fight the virus. Every donor's plasma is a little bit different and some may have more antibodies that protect against the virus better than others.\n\"Convalescent plasma, I think we need to have more caution about that,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci said recently. \"You want to make sure you do it right.\"\nThe push\nEven before scientists know for sure, the US Department of Defense said it wants to collect 8,000 units by the end of September. Casadevall said the government is also stockpiling 200,000 units, something he says is a sign that the experimental treatment is here to stay. Plasma can be stored frozen for about a year.\nWoodcock, who said the US government is trying to accelerate these plasma drives, thinks there may be an additional benefit to convalescent plasma that goes beyond treating someone's symptoms. \"I think people feel very helpless in the face of this,\" Woodcock said. \"This is something that everyone can contribute who's been infected.\"",

            "Text": "Hong Kong began a voluntary mass-testing programme for coronavirus on Tuesday, amid calls for its boycott by some pro-democracy activists, as part of a strategy to break the chain of transmission in the city's third outbreak of the disease.\n\nThe testing programme has become the latest political flashpoint in China's self-governing territory, with many distrustful over resources and staff coming from Beijing, and fears that residents' DNA could be collected during the exercise.\n\nThe Hong Kong government has dismissed such concerns, saying that no personal data will be attached to the specimen bottles and that samples will be destroyed in Hong Kong after the exercise.\n\nTesting began at 8am (00:00 GMT), with residents heading to more than 100 testing centres staffed by some 5,000 volunteers.\n\nAccording to the South China Morning Post, at least 10,000 people were tested in the first two hours of the programme, including many middle-aged and elderly people. The Hong Kong government said that as, of Monday evening, about 553,000 people had registered for the test.\n\nThe New Digital Etiquette\nAd by The New York Times \nSee More\nThe government expects 5 million of the city's 7.5 million residents to take part in the week-long programme, which could be extended to another week if there is demand.\n\nIt is aimed at identifying silent carriers of the virus - those without symptoms who could be spreading the disease.\n\nCalls for boycott\nHong Kong was hit by a sudden surge in cases in early July with the outbreak blamed in part on an exemption from quarantine requirements for airline staff, truck drivers from mainland China and sailors on cargo ships.\n\nAt its peak, Hong Kong recorded more than 100 locally transmitted cases a day, after going weeks without any in June.\n\nThe outbreak has slowed, with the territory reporting just nine cases on Monday, the first time in two weeks daily infections had fallen to single digits. However, the government and some experts say community testing will help detect asymptomatic carriers and further slow the spread of the virus.\n\nRespiratory medicine expert David Hui told AP news agency that even though infections have dwindled, the proportion of cases with untraceable sources of infection remain between 30 and 40 percent.\n\nAccording to Hui, the programme is more effective if most of the population takes part.\n\n\"If only 1 or 2 million people take part, then we may not be able to achieve that objective,\" he said.\n\nPro-democracy activist Joshua Wong was among those who urged people to boycott the testing and questioned the accuracy of the tests conducted, citing Swedish reports claiming that the test being used had returned \"high rates\" of false-positive results. Targeted testing\nIn an interview with Al Jazeera, Jessica Leung of the Civic Party also raised concerns about how data from the tests would be stored, and for how long. Dr Arisina Ma, from the Hong Kong Public Doctors\u2019 Association, also told Al Jazeera that while she is not against testing, the programme should be focused to make it cost-effective.\n\n\"Testing should be targeted to those with symptoms and those with close contact with confirmed cases,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Hong Kong is expected to resume face-to-face school classes from September 23 as authorities wind back strict coronavirus restrictions, which have kept about 900,000 students working at home for more than four months.\n\nThe city's government had said at the start of August that face-to-face classes would be suspended indefinitely.\n\nBut more than two-thirds of parents, regardless of income level, believe their children have difficulty learning at home, according to a February survey by the Education University of Hong Kong.\n\nA survey by The Society for Community Organisation (SoCO) of nearly 600 low-income students showed more than 70 percent did not have computers and 28 percent had no broadband internet at home.",

            "Text": "Rising numbers of coronavirus cases are leading to fears Britons are easing social distancing measures too hastily, with the United Kingdom's deputy chief medical officer worrying people had \"relaxed too much\" over the summer.\n\nWarning people on Monday that they must continue to follow guidelines to limit the spread of COVID-19, Jonathan Van-Tam said: \"We have got to start taking this very seriously again.\n\n\"If we're not careful we're going to have a bumpy ride.\"\n\nDaily case numbers had been rising at about 1,000 a day for most of August, but have started to increase in recent days.\n\nIn its latest bulletin on Monday, the health ministry reported 2,948 new cases - the second daily high since May - bringing the total number to 350,100.\n\nVan-Tam acknowledged that while data suggested the biggest rise in cases has been among young people - the 17 to 21-year-old age group - there was also evidence to show a more \"creeping geographic trend\" across the UK. \"Even if you're at lower risk of coronavirus, you can still have really serious symptoms and infect other people,\" Matt Hancock, the health minister, wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"It's really important everyone plays their part to follow the social distancing rules and help beat this disease,\" he said. \n\nIn a video shared by the BBC on Monday, Hancock said: Don't kill your gran by catching coronavirus and then passing it on\" - comments that were mocked by some social media users. The surge in the number of cases, however, comes amid stronger testing capacity since the peak of the first wave earlier this year.\n\nWhile fatalities increased by three to 41,554, Van-Tam urged caution: \"It's all very well saying that hospital admissions and deaths are at a very low level in the UK ... But if you look further into the European Union, you can see that where case numbers rise initially in the younger parts of the population, they do in turn filter through and start to give elevated rates of disease and hospital admissions in the older age groups.\n\n\"And we know that that then becomes a serious public health problem,\" he said.\n\n\nThe spike in UK cases follows jumps in Spain and France, two countries where a growing number of people were hospitalised with COVID-19 over the June-August summer months.",

            "Text": "The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorised the use of blood plasma from patients who recovered from COVID-19 as a treatment for the disease, a day after President Donald Trump blamed the agency for impeding the rollout of coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics for political reasons.\n\nThe announcement on Sunday from the FDA of a so-called \"emergency use authorisation\" also comes on the eve of the Republican National Convention, where Trump will be nominated to lead his party for four more years.\n\nA day before the FDA's announcement, Trump tagged the agency's Commissioner Stephen Hahn in a tweet and said, \"The deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics. Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd. Must focus on speed, and saving lives!\"\n\nOn Sunday, Trump hailed the FDA move as a \"breakthrough\". \n\n\"Everybody working together, we are years ahead of approvals than we would be if we went by the speed levels of the past administration,\" the Republican president said at a White House news briefing.\n\n\"You'll be hearing very soon about treatments and vaccines to save lives. We're removing unnecessary barriers and delays, not by cutting corners, but by marshaling the full power of the federal government.\" The FDA said early evidence suggests blood plasma can decrease mortality and improve the health of patients when administered in the first three days of their hospitalisation. It was not immediately clear what the immediate effect of the decision would be.\n\n\"It appeared that the product is safe and we're comfortable with that and we continue to see no concerning safety signals,\" Peter Marks, director of the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said on a conference call with reporters. The agency also said it determined it was a safe approach in an analysis of 20,000 patients who received the treatment. So far, 70,000 patients have been treated using blood plasma, the FDA said.\n\nPatients who benefitted the most from the treatment are those under 80 years old and who were not on a respirator, the agency said. Such patients had a 35 percent better survival rate a month after receiving the treatment.\n\nFDA Director Stephen Hahn said Trump had not spoken to him or the agency and did not play a role in its decision to make the announcement on Sunday. With no conclusive evidence of the treatment's benefits, some health experts were sceptical.\n\nDr Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said the move will hurt the response of the coronavirus treatment in the country. \n\n\"The blood plasma treatment has a lot of biological plausibility, but we do not yet know this works because we don't have randomised control data to show it is definitely beneficial,\" he told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"What the president's move does it makes it very unlikely that we'll get randomised controlled trial results and we may end up not knowing whether or not this worked.\"",

It is possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, including food or food packaging, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\n\nAfter shopping, handling food packages, or before preparing or eating food, it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizerexternal icon that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.

Handling meat from wild animals\nCurrently, there is no evidence that you can get infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 by eating food, including wild hunted game meat. However, hunters can get infected with other diseases when processing or eating game. Hunters should always practice good hygiene when processing animals by following these food safety recommendations: Do not harvest animals that appear sick or are found dead.\nKeep game meat clean and cool the meat down as soon as possible after harvesting the animal.\nAvoid cutting through the backbone and spinal tissues and do not eat the brains of any wild animal.\nWhen handling and cleaning game:\nWear rubber or disposable gloves.\nDo not eat, drink, or smoke.\nWhen finished handling and cleaning game:\nWash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.\nClean knives, equipment, and surfaces that were in contact with game meat with soap and water and then you may choose to disinfect further. While these recommendations apply to general food safety practices, if you are concerned about COVID-19, you may use a product on the EPA list of disinfectantsexternal icon for use against the COVID-19 virus.\nCook all game meat thoroughly (to an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F or higher).\nRaw wild meat or uncooked dishes containing the blood of wild animals should not be eaten, as such practices place people at high risk of contracting many types of infections.\nCheck with your state wildlife agency regarding any testing requirements for other diseases and for any specific instructions regarding preparing, transporting, and consuming game meat.

Special considerations exist for the prevention of COVID-19 in shared housing situations, and some of the following guidance might not apply to your specific shared housing situation.\n\nPeople living and working in this type of housing may have challenges with social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Shared housing residents often gather together closely for social, leisure, and recreational activities, shared dining, and/or use of shared equipment, such as kitchen appliances, laundry facilities, stairwells, and elevators.\n\nBe sure to consider the unique needs of your residents, such as people with disabilities, cognitive decline, or no access to technology. This guidance does not address infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. If your facility offers healthcare services, please consult CDC Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings\n\nThere may also be specific guidance for certain types of shared housing, such as homeless shelters, that may apply to your facility.\n\nState, territorial, local, and tribal public health departments can give you specific information on COVID-19 transmission and policies in your community, which can help you decide when and if you need to scale up or loosen prevention measures.\n\nPlan and prepare\nReview, update, and implement emergency operations plans (EOPs)\nSome shared housing facilities have already experienced an outbreak of COVID-19, others have a handful of cases, and others have not yet had infection introduced.  Regardless of the status of a facility, the most important thing is for all facilities to plan and prepare. No matter the level of transmission in a community, every shared housing facility should have a plan in place to protect residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors from the spread of COVID-19.  This should be done in collaboration with state and local public health departments, housing authorities, local or state regulatory agencies, and other relevant partners. Focus should be on components, or annexes, of already-existing plans that address infectious disease outbreaks. If your shared housing facility does not have an emergency operations plans (EOP), now is the time to develop one.\n\nReference key resources while developing, reviewing, updating, and implementing the EOP\nMultiple federal agencies have developed resources on emergency preparedness, which may be helpful for administrators of shared housing facilities.\nThe National Multifamily Housing Council (NHMC)external icon provides guidance on emergency preparedness and response resources for the apartment industry.

Develop information-sharing systems that are tailored to the needs of your setting. For instance, administrators can support residents who have no or limited access to the internet by delivering print materials to their residents. Printable materials for community-based settings are available on the CDC website.\nPromoting healthy behaviors that reduce spread, maintaining healthy environments and operations, and knowing what to do if someone gets sick.\nTaking action to prevent or slow the spread of COVID-19. This includes limiting the number of non-essential visitors to workers, volunteers, and visitors who are essential to preserving the health, including the mental health, well-being, and safety of residents.\nConsider identifying residents who have unique medical needs and behavioral health needs and encourage them to develop a plan for if they or their primary caregiver(s) become ill.\nTo maintain safe operations\nReview the CDC guidance for businesses and employers to identify strategies to maintain operations and a healthy working and living environment.\nDevelop flexible sick leave policies. Require staff to stay home when sick, even without documentation from doctors. Use flexibility, when possible, to allow staff to stay home to care for sick family or household members or to care for children in the event of school or childcare dismissals. Make sure that employees are aware of and understand these policies.\nCreate plans to protect the staff and residents from spread of COVID-19 and help them put in place personal preventive measures.\nClean and disinfect shared areas (such as exercise room, laundry facilities, shared bathrooms, and elevators) and frequently touched surfaces using EPA-registered disinfectantsexternal icon more than once a day if possible.\nIdentify services and activities (such as meal programs, religious services, and exercise rooms and programs) that might need to be limited or temporarily discontinued.

Use virtual communications and check ins (phone or video chat), as appropriate.\nLimit the presence of non-essential volunteers and visitors in shared areas, when possible.\nUse physical barriers, such as sneeze guards, or extra tables or chairs, to protect front desk/check-in staff who will have interactions with residents, visitors, and the public.\nProvide COVID-19 prevention supplies for staff and residents in common areas at your facility, such as soap, alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol, tissues, trash baskets, and, if possible, masks that are washed or discarded after each use.\nConsider any special communications and assistance needs of your staff and residents, including persons with disabilities.\nSuggest that residents keep up-to-date lists of medical conditions and medications, and periodically check to ensure they have a sufficient supply of their prescription and over-the-counter medications.\nIf possible, help residents understand they can contact their healthcare provider to ask about getting extra necessary medications to have on hand for a longer period of time, or to consider using a mail-order option for medications.\nMake sure that residents are aware of serious symptoms of their underlying conditions and of COVID-19 symptoms that require emergency care, and that they know who to ask for help and call 911.\nEncourage residents who live alone to seek out a \u201cbuddy\u201d in the facility who will check on and help care for them and safely make sure they are getting basic necessities, including food and household essentials.\nNote: Surgical masks and N-95 respirators are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance. All staff and residents should wear a mask covering when in shared areas of the facility and maintain social distancing to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nCommunicate to staff and residents\nIdentify platforms such as email, websites, hotlines, automated text messaging, newsletters, and flyers to help communicate information on:\n\nGuidance and directives from state and local officials and state and localexternal icon health departments.\nHow your facility is helping to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\nHow additional information will be shared, and where to direct questions.\nHow to stay healthy, including videos, fact sheets, and posters with information on COVID-19 symptoms and how to stop the spread of germs, how to wash your hands, and what to do if you are sick.\nHow staff and residents can cope and manage stress and protect others from stigma and discrimination.\nIdentify and address potential language, cultural, and disability barriers associated with communicating COVID-19 information. Communications may need to be framed or adapted so they are culturally appropriate for your audience and easy to understand. For example, there are resources on the CDC website that are in many languages.\nConsiderations for common spaces in your facility, to prevent the spread of COVID-19\nConsider how you can use multiple strategies to maintain social (physical) distance between everyone in common spaces of the facility.\nConsider cancelling all public or non-essential group activities and events.\nOffer alternative methods for activities and social interaction such as participation by phone, online, or through recorded sessions.\nArrange seating of chairs and tables to be least 6 feet (2 meters) apart during shared meals or other events.\nAlter schedules to reduce mixing and close contact, such as staggering meal and activity times and forming small groups that regularly participate at the same times and do not mix.\nMinimize traffic in enclosed spaces, such as elevators and stairwells. Consider limiting the number of individuals in an elevator at one time and designating one directional stairwells, if possible.\nEnsure that social distancing can be maintained in shared rooms, such as television, game, or exercise rooms.\nMake sure that shared rooms in the facility have good air flow from an air conditioner or an opened window.\nConsider working with building maintenance staff to determine if the building ventilation system can be modified to increase ventilation rates or the percentage of outdoor air that circulates into the system.\nClean and disinfect shared areas (laundry facilities, elevators, shared kitchens, exercise rooms, dining rooms) and frequently touched surfaces using EPA-registered disinfectantsexternal icon more than once a day if possible.\nConsiderations for specific communal rooms in your facility\nShared kitchens and dining rooms\nRestrict the number of people allowed in the kitchen and dining room at one time so that everyone can stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) apart from one another.\nPeople who are sick, their roommates, and those who have higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 should eat or be fed in their room, if possible.\nDo not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, or eating utensils.

Totes could also be used for personal items to limit their contact with other surfaces in the bathroom.\nIf a resident in your facility has COVID-19 (suspected or confirmed)\nHave the resident seek advice by telephone from a healthcare provider to determine whether medical evaluation is needed.\nResidents are not required to notify administrators if they think they may or have a confirmed case of COVID-19. If you do receive information that someone in your facility has COVID-19, you should work with the local health departmentexternal icon to notify anyone in the building who may have been exposed (had close contact with the sick person) while maintaining the confidentiality of the sick person as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and, if applicable, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\nProvide the ill person with information on how to care for themselves and when to seek medical attention.\nEncourage residents with COVID-19 symptoms and their roommates and close contacts to self-isolate \u2013 limit their use of shared spaces as much as possible.\nIf possible, designate a separate bathroom for residents with COVID-19 symptoms.\nConsider reducing cleaning frequency in bedrooms and bathrooms dedicated to persons with COVID-19 symptoms to as-needed cleaning (e.g., soiled items and surfaces) to avoid unnecessary contact with the ill persons.\nFollow guidance on when to stop isolation.\nMinimize the number of staff members who have face-to-face interactions with residents who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19.\nEncourage staff, other residents, caregivers such as outreach workers, and others who visit persons with COVID-19 symptoms to follow recommended precautions to prevent the spread.\nStaff at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 should not have close contact with residents who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19, if possible.\nThose who have been in close contact (i.e., less than 6 feet (2 meters) with a resident who has confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should monitor their health and call their healthcare provider if they develop symptoms suggestive of COVID-19.\nBe prepared for the potential need to transport persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 for testing or non-urgent medical care. Avoid using public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis. Follow guidelines for cleaning and disinfecting any transport vehicles. \nAccepting new residents at facilities that offer support services\nFirst, review and follow the guidance and directives from your state and local officials.\n\nIf your situation is not restricted by their guidance and directives, then consider the following guidance:\n\nAt check-in, provide any new or potential resident with a clean mask and keep them isolated from others. Shelters can use this tool to screen for symptoms at entry.\nMedical evaluation may be necessary depending on the symptoms.\nIf your facility is full, your facility space is inadequate to maintain physical distancing (such as is recommended in the guidance for homeless shelters), or you do not have the resources (staff, prevention supplies) to accept additional residents, reach out to community- or faith-based organizations to help meet individuals\u2019 needs, including:\nA safe place to stay\nAbility to obtain basic necessities, such as food, personal hygiene products, and medicine\nAccess to any needed medical or behavioral health services\nAccess to a phone or a device with internet access to seek out resources and virtual services and support\nAdditional CDC resources to help prevent spread of COVID-19 in shared or congregate housing settings\nMore detailed guidance is available for specific types of facilities.

Certain aspects of these strategies apply to non-school buildings operated by K-12 school systems (e.g., office workers in district administration buildings, transportation hubs, and maintenance shops).\n\nSpecifically, this page provides information about:\n\nWhat is currently known about COVID-19 transmission in schools and the exposure risk among K-12 school staff;\nPreventing and reducing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 among school staff, which will also prevent transmission among students and the wider community;\nMaintaining healthy school operations;\nMaintaining a healthy school/work environment; and\nSpecial considerations for certain occupations within school environments.\nWho is this information for?\nThese strategies are intended for K-12 school administrators preparing for school programs for staff and students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Administrators oversee the daily operations of K-12 schools. These strategies are also intended for other groups, including school district superintendents, school principals, and assistant principals, who share responsibilities for safely operating school buildings. Finally, this information may also be useful to boards of education, state and local policy makers, unions/labor groups, school employees, including teachers, paraprofessionals, other support staff, and parents, families, and students.\n\nAll K-12 school workplaces developing plans to continue operations while COVID-19 outbreaks occur among teachers, staff, and students, or in the surrounding community, should:\n\nWork directly with appropriate state, tribal, local, and territorial public health officials and occupational safety and health professionals;\nIncorporate relevant aspects of CDC guidance, including, but not limited to, CDC\u2019s Schools and Childcare Programs\u200b: Plan, Prepare, and Respond and Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers;\nIncorporate guidance from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)external icon and other federal and state regulatory agencies, as needed; and\nCommunicate regularly with families, staff, and other partners about important COVID-19 information.\nGuiding Principles to Keep in Mind\nThe risk for COVID-19 spread rises with increased close contact with others. The more people who teachers and staff interact with, and the longer those interactions last, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. While not exhaustive, Operating schools during COVID-19: CDC\u2019s Considerations provides a stratification that attempts to characterize the risks of spread among students, teachers, and staff across this continuum.\n\nExposure Risk among K-12 Staff\nThe risk of occupational spread of COVID-19 depends on several factors. Some of these factors are described in the joint publication by the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services titled Guidance on Preparing Workplaces for COVID-19pdf iconexternal icon. Distinctive factors that affect risk for exposure to COVID-19 for teachers and staff in school settings include:\n\nDistance between staff and others: In addition to their primary job functions and interaction with students, school staff may also be near (within 6 feet) one another at times, such as when arriving at school and during breaks. Shared spaces (e.g., break rooms, entrances/exits, restrooms) and shared transportation to and from the school (e.g., personal or public transportation, carpooling, ride sharing) may increase their risk. These can be mitigated or minimized with good practices.\nDuration of contact: Extended contact (15 minutes or greater) with potentially infectious individuals increases the risk of COVID-19 spread.\nType of contact: Current evidence indicates that COVID-19 spreads primarily through respiratory droplets and short-range aerosols produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks in close proximity to other people. At this time, long-range airborne transmission does not appear to be a primary way COVID-19 spreads. There is not yet clear evidence that ventilation systems spread the virus from space to space causing exposures. Studies indicate that people who are not showing symptoms (i.e., asymptomatic) can still spread the virus. COVID-19 exposure may also occur from touching one\u2019s mouth, nose, or possibly eyes after contact with contaminated surfaces or objects, such as office equipment, workstations, or break room tables.\nMore information on what is known about the signs and symptoms, burden, and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among children can be found in Preparing K-12 School Administrators for a Safe Return to School in Fall 2020.\n\nPersons at Higher Risk for Illness\nStaff at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 include older adults and people of any age with certain underlying medical conditions. Policies and procedures addressing issues related to teachers and other staff at higher risk of serious illness should be made in consultation with occupational medicine and human resource professionals, keeping in mind Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) concerns.\n\nSymptoms\nThe profile of symptoms associated with COVID-19 remains under study and will be updated as warranted by research findings. Check the CDC website for the latest information.\n\nCreate a COVID-19 Hazard Assessment Plan\nEvery school should have a plan in place to protect staff, children, and their families from the spread of COVID-19, and a response plan in place for if/when a student, teacher, or staff member tests positive for COVID-19. For information on developing and implementing an Emergency Operations Plan (EOP), please refer to the Operating schools during COVID-19: CDC\u2019s Considerations website.\n\nAn important part of a school\u2019s EOP is to develop a plan for conducting initial and periodic hazard assessmentsexternal icon of the school to identify COVID-19 risks, prevention strategies (e.g., engineering and administrative controls and personal protective equipment (PPE)), and to identify new or recurring hazards.\n\nTo create a hazard assessment plan:\nRefer to the OSHA website to learn more about how to develop a hazard assessmentexternal icon plan.\nEngage with staff across the full range of jobs associated with schools (e.g., classroom instructors, school healthcare professionals, school nutrition staff, custodial staff, office staff, and others) to learn the specific hazards and exposures associated with each position.\nCreate small working groups or teams that can assess group-specific hazards and report back to the larger assessment team.\nAssemble health and safety working groups with employee and management representatives, from both the district and school levels, to assist with developing, implementing, and evaluating a health and safety plan and adjusting accordingly.\nWork closely with occupational health and safety and/or occupational medical professionals, when possible.\nInclude representatives of authorized unions, if applicable.\nConduct a thorough hazard assessment to determine if workplace hazards are present, or are likely to be present, and determine what type of controls or PPE are needed for specific job duties. For more information on conducting a hazard assessmentexternal icon, please refer to the Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers Responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nCollect information regularly through a variety of channels (e.g., email, electronic surveys, virtual meetings, focus groups) to reach a wider cross-section of staff, and elicit deeper, more informative responses.\nSee the OSHA COVID-19external icon webpage for more information on how to protect workers from potential COVID-19 exposures. Guidance may also be available from state, local, or professional technical organizations. For example, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) has published Reopening Guide for Schools and Universitiespdf iconexternal icon which includes useful plans and checklists to prepare buildings for occupancy and check on equipment and systems, as well as maintenance plans and checks during the academic year.\n\nStrategies for Controlling COVID-19 Exposures\nInfection prevention recommendations for staff and students are based on an approach known as the hierarchy of controls. This approach groups actions by their effectiveness in reducing or removing hazards. In most cases, the preferred approach is for management to:\n\nReduce the risk of COVID-19 by having teachers, staff, and students stay home when sick or if they have been in close contact with a person with COVID-19. Monitor COVID-19 transmission rates in the immediate community and in the communities in which students, teachers, and staff live. Work collaboratively with local health officials to determine if temporary school closure is necessary.\nInstall engineering controls, including modifying work areas using physical barriers, incorporating required accessibility requirements, and improving ventilation, where feasible.\nEstablish administrative controls and safe work practices for all staff to follow, which include appropriate cleaning and disinfection practices and appropriate mask policies.\nProvide PPE in accordance with the school administrator\u2019s worksite hazard assessment to protect staff from hazards not controlled by engineering and administrative controls alone (e.g., school health staff, janitorial and maintenance staff).\nvirus icon\nReducing the risks of COVID-19 in K-12 school worksites\nK-12 school administration, particularly in areas where community spread of COVID-19 is occurring, should develop and implement a comprehensive strategy aimed at preventing the introduction of COVID-19 into school facilities. Please refer to the CDC Preparing K-12 School Administrators for a Safe Return to School page for more information.\n\nStrategies for reducing the spread of COVID-19 in schools include educating and training staff on at-home symptom screening (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat) and cooperating with federal and local health officials, including to facilitate contact tracing, if exposures or infections warrant.\n\nScreening K-12 school staff for COVID-19\nGiven the wide range of symptoms and the fact that some people with COVID-19 are presymptomatic or asymptomatic, there are limitations to symptom screening for the identification of COVID-19. CDC does not currently recommend that schools conduct universal in-person symptom screenings. Refer to Screening K-12 Students for Symptoms of COVID-19: Limitations and Considerations for more information on screening students. Information about screening employees can be found on the General Business Frequently Asked Questions page. One option is to encourage staff to self-screen prior to coming onsite.\n\nTesting of K-12 school staff\nCDC does not recommend universal testing of all students and staff. CDC\u2019s Interim Considerations for K-12 School Administrators for SARS-CoV-2 Testing advises that schools should determine, in collaboration with local health officials, whether to implement any testing strategy and, if so, how to best do so. School administrators are encouraged to review SARS-CoV-2 Testing Strategy: Considerations for Non-Healthcare Workplaces when considering testing of all school employees.\n\nManaging sick staff\nWhen school staff or students report or have symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat) upon arrival at work or become sick during the day, school administrators should:\n\nImmediately separate the person(s) from others at the school. Individuals who are sick should immediately go home or to a healthcare facility depending on how severe their symptoms are, and follow CDC guidance for caring for oneself and others who are sick.\nActively encourage staff and students who are sick, or who have recently had close contact with a person with COVID-19, to get tested and stay home.\nDevelop policies that encourage sick staff to stay at home but without fear of retaliation, and ensure employees are aware of these policies.\nIdentify an isolation area to separate anyone who has COVID-19 symptoms and potential exposure, ideally with a dedicated restroom not used by others. Note: Considerations for screening and management of symptoms for adults may be different than those for K-12 students. Additional considerations related to screening teachers and staff can be found on the General Business FAQ page.\nEnsure that personnel managing sick employees or students are appropriately protected from exposure. See What Healthcare Personnel Should Know About Caring for Patients with Confirmed or Possible COVID-19 Infection.\nOnly designated, trained staff should interact with people showing symptoms of COVID-19. At least one designated, trained staff member should be available at all times in case there is a need to isolate a symptomatic employee or student.\nWhen providing care for anyone with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, personnel who need to be within 6 feet of a sick colleague or student should be provided appropriate PPE (including gloves, a gown, a face shield or goggles, and an N95 or equivalent or higher-level respirator or a surgical facemask if a respirator is not available), and follow Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions.\nIf respirators are needed, they must be used in the context of a comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes medical exams, fit testing, and training in accordance with OSHA\u2019s Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134external icon).\nIf the district has health and safety professional/s, work with them to establish a respiratory protection program; if not, professional organizations, such as the American Industrial Hygiene Associationexternal icon (AIHA) and the American Society of Safety Professionalsexternal icon (ASSP), maintain lists of health and safety consultants across the U.S. who may be able to assist with implementing a respiratory protection program.\nThe OSHA Respiratory Protection websiteexternal icon provides links to a variety of guidance documents, web pages, and online tools related to respiratory protection.\nOn-site healthcare services staff, including school nurses, should follow appropriate CDC and OSHA guidance for healthcare and emergency response personnel. For additional information, refer to the Special Considerations \u2013 School nurses/health professionals section below.\nHave a procedure in place for the safe and accessible transport of an employee who becomes sick while at work. The employee may need to be transported home or to a healthcare provider.\nIf a school staff member is confirmed to have COVID-19, contact the local public health authorities about contact tracing.\nMaintain the sick employee\u2019s confidentiality, as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and other applicable federal and state laws. Instruct fellow staff about how to proceed based on the CDC Public Health Recommendations for Community-Related Exposure.\nIf a school staff member becomes or reports being sick, clean and disinfect the work area and any shared common areas (including restrooms) and any supplies, tools, or equipment handled by that staff member.\nWork with local health officials to facilitate the identification of other exposed and potentially exposed individuals, such as coworkers or students, in the school.\nStudents, teachers, and staff who test positive or had close contact with an individual who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 should be provided with guidance for when it is safe to discontinue self-isolation or end quarantine.\nuser cog light icon\nEngineering controls\nIncreasing ventilation\nConsider steps to increase the delivery of clean air and dilute potential contaminants. Not all steps are applicable for all scenarios. Consult with experienced HVAC professionals when considering changes to HVAC systems and equipment. Some of these recommendations are based on ASHRAE Guidance for Building Operations During the COVID-19 Pandemicexternal icon. Review additional ASHRAE guidelines for schools and universitiespdf iconexternal icon for further information on ventilation recommendations for different types of buildings and building readiness for occupancy.\n\nImprovement steps may include some, or all, of the following activities:\n\nIncrease outdoor air ventilation, using caution when outdoor air quality is low.\nWhen weather conditions allow, increase fresh outdoor air by opening windows and doors. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk (e.g., risk of falling, triggering asthma symptoms) to children and staff using the school.\nConsider outdoor classes where circumstances allow.\nUse fans to increase the effectiveness of open windows. Position fans securely and carefully in/near windows so as not to induce potentially contaminated airflow directly from one person over another (strategic window fan placement in exhaust mode can help draw fresh air into the room via other open windows and doors without generating strong room air currents).\nDecrease occupancy in areas where outdoor ventilation cannot be increased.\nEnsure ventilation systems operate properly and provide acceptable indoor air quality as defined by ASHRAE Standard 62.1, Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Qualityexternal icon, for the current occupancy level for each space.\nIncrease total airflow supply to occupied spaces, whenever feasible.\nDisable demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) controls that reduce air supply based on occupancy or temperature during occupied hours.\nFurther open minimum outdoor air dampers to reduce or eliminate HVAC air recirculation, if practical. In mild weather, this will not affect thermal comfort or humidity. However, this may be difficult to do in cold, hot, or humid weather.\nImprove central air filtration:\nIncrease air filtrationexternal icon to as high as possible without significantly diminishing design.\nInspect filter housing and racks to ensure appropriate filter fit and check for ways to minimize filter bypass.\nCheck filters to ensure they are within service life and appropriately installed.\nConsider running the HVAC system at maximum outside airflow for 2 hours before and after occupied times.\nEnsure restroom exhaust fans are functional and operating at full capacity when the building is occupied.\nInspect and maintain local exhaust ventilation in areas such as restrooms, kitchens, cooking areas, etc.\nConsider portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) fan/filtration systems to help enhance air cleaning (especially in higher risk areas such as nurse\u2019s office).\nGenerate clean-to-less-clean air movement by re-evaluating the positioning of supply and exhaust air diffusers and/or dampers (especially in higher risk areas such as administrative reception areas and nurse\u2019s office).\nConsider using ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) as a supplement to help inactivate SARS-CoV-2, especially if options for increasing room ventilation are limited.\nVentilation considerations are also important on school buses. See section titled Special Considerations \u2013 School bus drivers and bus aides for additional information.\nOther engineering controls\nFor information on other engineering controls, such as water systems, modified layouts, and physical barriers and guides, please refer to Operating schools during COVID-19: CDC\u2019s Considerations and CDC\u2019s Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers.\n\nclipboard list check light icon\nAdministrative controls\nImportant administrative controls include staggering and alternating schedules, reducing maximum occupancy in all areas of the building, closing indoor communal use spaces, promoting hand hygiene, implementing cleaning and disinfection protocols, and posting signs and messages to promote everyday protective measures.\n\nIn addition, K-12 school administrators may consider strategies to:\n\nReinforce use of masks (refer to Guidance for K-12 School Administrators on the Use of Masks in Schools for more information).\nMasks are not personal protective equipment and should not be worn instead of respiratory protectionexternal icon when respirators are required.\nImplement social distancing measures and cohorting.\nInstitute flexible leave policies.\nEnsure that policies encourage sick employees to stay at home but without fear of retaliation, and ensure employees are aware of these policies.\nMinimize elevator use, wherever possible, and encourage the use of stairs. Review CDC\u2019s Considerations for Schools, FAQ for School Administrators on Reopening Schools, and COVID-19 Employer Information for Office Buildings for information related to safely using elevators during the pandemic.\nConsider strategies for protecting staff at higher risk for severe illness\nOffer options for staff at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 (e.g., telework, virtual teaching opportunities, modified job responsibilities, or temporary reassignment to different job responsibilities). Employers may also consider extending these options to staff with a household member at higher risk of severe illness if exposed to COVID-19.\nIf a job may only be performed at the workplace, investigate reasonable accommodationsexternal icon that could offer protection to an individual whose disability puts them at greater risk from COVID-19. Some accommodations may meet an employee\u2019s needs on a temporary basis without causing undue hardship on the employer. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has established guidance regarding Pandemic Preparedness in the Workplace and the Americans with Disabilities Actexternal icon. The guidance enables employers to take steps to protect teachers and staff, consistent with CDC guidance.\nConsistent with applicable federal, state, and local law, put in place policies to protect the privacy of people at higher risk for severe illness due to underlying medical conditions.\nEducate and train K-12 staff about how they can reduce the spread of COVID-19\nTraining should be provided to all staff, including substitute teachers and other temporary personnel. Communication and training for staff should be easy to understand and be provided in languages other than English, as needed. Training should also be accompanied by necessary instructional materials in accessible formats, as required, and include information about:\n\nSymptoms of COVID-19, how it spreads, risks for workplace exposures and how teachers and staff can protect themselves, and the different risk levels for different populations depending on age and medical condition.\nProper handwashing practices and use of hand sanitizer.\nCough and sneeze etiquette.\nOther routine infection control precautions (e.g., putting on or taking off masks, social distancing measures).\nMore detailed information on PPE training for school nurses and health professionals is provided in the Special Considerations \u2013 School nurses/health professionals section below.\nProcedures to follow when an employee becomes sick or is exposed to someone who is potentially sick.\nOther workplace hazards, including exposure to cleaning and disinfectant chemicals, and ways to minimize exposure without compromising cleaning and disinfection.\nOSHA provides additional informationexternal icon about training on its COVID-19 webpage.\nCleaning and disinfection in K-12 school worksites\nConsult general CDC guidance for cleaning and disinfecting worksites, which may help guide planning for COVID-19 disinfection.\nRefer to List Nexternal icon on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) website for EPA-registered disinfectants that have qualified under EPA\u2019s emerging viral pathogens program for use against SARS-CoV-2.\nReduce the risk of asthma among staff and studentsexternal icon, and other health effects related to disinfecting, by selecting less-toxic disinfectant productsexternal icon on list N with asthma-safer ingredients (e.g., citric acid or lactic acid) as well as by reviewing the NIOSH/OSHA Info sheetpdf icon on protecting workers who use cleaning chemicals. Vapors from cleaning products can linger long-after they have been applied, which can exacerbate asthma symptoms and expose students and staff to potentially harmful substances.\nFollow label directions for appropriate dilution rates and contact times.\nProvide staff training on chemical hazardsexternal icon and manufacturer\u2019s directions.\nMinimize exposure to cleaning and disinfectant chemicals without compromising disinfection by considering steps, such as:\nUse pre-mixed (ready-to-use) cleaning and disinfectant products instead of having to mix or dilute product.\nUse enclosed mixing/diluting dispenser systems to accurately mix products and minimize exposures.\nAvoid using spray products to clean surfaces such as mirrors and windows, using wipes or pre-soaked rags instead.\nUse containers/buckets with lids to store cleaning wipes/rags or product, and keep lids closed between cleaning of surfaces.\nRead and follow all instruction labels to ensure safe and appropriate use. Do not use stronger concentrations than recommended as they will not be more effective and could exacerbate asthma and other chemical-related health conditions.\nEstablish a written protocol for the increased cleaning and disinfecting of areas, such as restrooms, locker rooms, office work areas, cafeterias, break areas, and common spaces, that ensures routine cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces (e.g., desks, door knobs, time clocks, microwave or refrigerator handles, sinks, dispensers, vending machine touchpads) at least once per school day, if feasible.\nSee Special Considerations \u2013 Janitors and Maintenance Staff for more information.\nFrequently clean push bars and handles on any doors that do not open automatically and handrails on stairs or along walkways.\nFrequently clean physical barriers (if used).\nEnsure staff keep cleaning and disinfectant products out of children\u2019s reach and stored in a space with restricted access.\nSee Special Considerations \u2013 Janitors and Maintenance Staff for additional information on training and safety precautions.\nglove icon\nPersonal protective equipment (PPE)\nEmployers are responsible for providing a safe and healthy workplaceexternal icon. Conduct a thorough hazard assessmentexternal icon of the school worksite to identify potential workplace hazards related to COVID-19. When engineering and administrative controls cannot be implemented or are not fully protective, employers are required by OSHA standards (29 CFR part 1910, Subpart Iexternal icon) to:\n\nDetermine what PPE is needed for their specific job duties (e.g., school nurses or other health services staff performing job tasks that expose them to chemicals or particulate matter).\nFor example, some school staff need PPE in order to perform their jobs safely, such as janitorial and maintenance staff.\nMasks are not PPE.\nSelect and provide appropriate PPE to staff at no cost, if required.\nSome barriers may offer better protection for a variety of chemicals. More information on recommended barriers for common disinfectants can be located at the CDC Hazard Communication for Disinfectants Used Against Viruses. Always review the label on the product before use and follow manufacturers\u2019 recommendations in the product\u2019s safety data sheet.\nTrain their staffexternal icon on hazard identification and correct use (including putting on and removing) of PPE.\nWhen respirators are not required to protect workers, employers may consider allowing voluntary use of filtering facepiece respirators (such as N95s) if staff wish to provide and use such equipment on their own. Owners and operators who allow voluntary use of respirators should ensure they comply with the voluntary use provisions of the OSHA Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134).\n\nIn light of potential PPE shortages, administrators should consider modifying staff and student interaction and use the suggested engineering and administrative controls, mentioned above, as primary prevention and control measures that reduce the need for PPE. See the Special Considerations section for information on limited circumstances in which PPE for K-12 staff may be necessary.\n\nSupporting Teacher and Staff Mental Health and Well-Being\nTo protect and support the mental health of K-12 teachers and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, administrators should consider these options:\n\nProvide mental health benefits. Circulate information about your district\u2019s Employee Assistance Plan and any mental health and counseling services that are available. Remind staff what mental health benefits are included in their insurance plans.\nImplement flexible sick leave policies and practices. Each staff member\u2019s life outside of work is different. Many have caregiving responsibilities and may need to provide care for ill loved ones, oversee virtual learning, and/or arrange child- or elder-care during a time when access to such care may be limited. Be understanding and flexible with leave policies and work schedules as circumstances change and needs arise.\nEvaluate changes to work design. Eliminate non-essential tasks so staff can focus on the critical ones. Reduce ambiguity by providing necessary resources and guidance for how to instruct and carry out job tasks under changing circumstances. Give staff more control over how they carry out work tasks.\nSupport coping and resilience. Encourage teachers and school staff to take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories about COVID-19, including social media, if they are feeling overwhelmed or distressed. Encourage employees to talk with people they trust about their concerns and how they are feeling. Consider posting signage for the Disaster Distress Helpline: 1-800-985-5990, or text TalkWithUs to 66746.\nFoster wellness. Consider holding all-staff meetings that focus on mental health awareness, if facilities allow for appropriate social distancing. If you educate staff about mental health and encourage open conversation about the challenges people are experiencing, employees may be more likely to access care when needed. If you have access to a wellness provider, consider hosting virtual mindfulness or discussion sessions. Consider the importance of healthy sleep. Staff can also serve as valuable resources to one another by sharing strategies for coping with the pandemic.\nConnect. If remote work is necessary, remember that physical distance does not have to mean socially distant. Using virtual platforms to continue team building and staff meetings can be good for morale by fostering a sense of community and togetherness and easing feelings of loneliness. Be inclusive; provide opportunities for staff, at all levels, in all departments, to participate in these interactions.\nProvide training. Consider that staff members may have different levels of ability with using virtual platforms and new learning technologies. Offer training and technical support for new job demands may help to reduce stress.\nModel healthy behavior. Encourage all school leaders to take care of their own physical, social, and psychological needs. By doing so, they serve as role models and set the tone that it is acceptable and necessary to take care of oneself.\nFor additional information, please see the Resources section.\n\nSpecial Considerations\nchalkboard teacher light icon\nTeachers, substitute teachers, paraprofessionals, and specialists\nThe overall guidance for prevention and control in this document will suffice in most standard classroom or school environments. Some teachers and staff may encounter work situations that require modifying or adapting policies or procedures due to the nature of the work required, including:\n\nWhen social distancing cannot be maintained\nK-12 staff will not always be able to maintain 6 feet of distance between themselves and students. This issue may be of particular concern to paraprofessionals, therapists, and other staff who have close and consistent contact with students with disabilities. These teachers and staff are considered to be in the same general risk category as direct service providers who provide similar services outside of the school setting. In these cases, additional steps must be taken to ensure the safety of the staff and the students by reducing the likelihood of COVID-19 spread, through adopting additional control measures, such as:\n\nUsing physical barriers (e.g., plexiglass or similar materials, other impermeable dividers or partitions) to separate staff and students from each other in classrooms or other shared spaces.\nReducing exposure amount by reducing daily caseloads, where feasible.\nRelocating workspaces to the best ventilated spaces in the building.\nWearing a mask as much as possible during service delivery.\nConsidering adaptations and alternatives, whenever possible, to increase the feasibility of wearing a mask to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading.\nConsidering whether service providers may need additional protective equipment for some interactions with students. See CDC\u2019s Guidance for Direct Service Providers for additional information.\nWhen a mask cannot be worn by staff (or some students)\nCDC recognizes that wearing masks may not be possible in every situation or for some people. In some situations, wearing a mask may exacerbate a physical or mental health condition or introduce significant safety concerns. Wearing masks may be difficult for people with sensory, cognitive, or behavioral issues. Masks prevent reading lips and observing facial expressions. Individuals requesting mask exemptions may be asked by the employer to provide documentationexternal icon regarding why the accommodation is necessary. This health information should be kept confidential, in accordance with applicable federal and state privacy laws and regulations. Adaptations and alternatives should be considered, whenever possible, to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 when wearing a mask is not feasible.\n\nWhen K-12 administrators and staff need to visit multiple locations or worksites\nIn addition to the general considerations to be followed above, administrators and staff that move from location to location throughout the day should take special care to not spread COVID-19 between sites during their movements. Ways to prevent spread in these cases include:\n\nPracticing good hand hygiene before and after visiting each location.\nCleaning and disinfecting shared supplies or tools used in multiple locations by multiple people, after each use, before being used by the next group of students or educators.\nCleaning and disinfecting their vehicle\u2019s commonly touched surfaces after visiting each site or at least once a day.\ntools light icon\nJanitors and maintenance staff\nImplement enhanced cleaning and disinfecting practices\nDevelop a schedule and daily checklist for increased, routine cleaning and disinfection. An established schedule can avoid under- or over-use of cleaning products.\nEstablish a comprehensive written protocol for increased cleaning and disinfection of areas, such as classrooms, communal dining halls or cafeterias, restrooms, locker rooms, office work areas, break areas, and common spaces, that ensures routine cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces (e.g., desks, door knobs, time clocks, microwave or refrigerator handles, sinks, dispensers, vending machine touchpads).\nConsider whether cleaning and disinfecting may be necessary at the following times:\nIn the morning before students and staff arrive\nBetween classes\nBetween use of shared surfaces or objects\nBefore and after meals\nBefore students return from recess\nAfter students leave for the day\nSelect disinfectant products on List Nexternal icon with asthma-safer ingredientsexternal icon (citric acid or lactic acid) to reduce the risk of asthma and other health effects related to disinfecting, as recommended by the US EPA Design for Environment program.\nFor additional information, review the NIOSH/OSHA Infosheet on protecting workers who use cleaning chemicalspdf iconexternal icon. Health hazards for active ingredients of common disinfectants are here. Ensure staff keep cleaning and disinfectant products out of children\u2019s reach and stored in a space with restricted access.\nEnsure all employees performing cleaning have access to cleaning products\u2019 safety data sheets (SDSs) and are informed of potential hazards and trained on the associated safe practices per the information found in the SDSs.\nMinimize exposure to cleaning and disinfectant chemicals, without compromising disinfection, by referring to the Cleaning and disinfection in K-12 school worksites section above.\nTrain staff who use cleaners and disinfectants on the comprehensive written protocol to read and interpret all instruction labels and understand safe and appropriate use.\nProvide easy-to-understand instructional materials and training in languages other than English, as needed.\nVentilation considerations during cleaning and disinfecting\nRefer to the Ventilation section when cleaning and disinfecting to prevent overexposure to chemicals.\nProvide and encourage use of necessary personal protective equipment (PPE)\nCustodial staff and any other staff who clean and disinfect the school site should have access to proper PPE, including gloves, eye protection, respiratory protection, and other appropriate PPE, as required by the product instructions in the SDS and appropriate training in their safe use.\nIf respiratory protection is recommended on the SDS, consider using a respirator with a combination cartridge for chemicals and particulate exposure.\nMaintenance workers who perform routine maintenance of the HVAC system, especially checking or replacing filters and dust build up, need to use appropriate PPE.\nIf respirators are needed, they must be used in the context of a comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes medical exams, fit testing, and training in accordance with OSHA\u2019s Respiratory Protectionexternal icon standard (29 CFR 1910.134external icon).\nRefer to the Reducing the risks of COVID-19 in K-12 school worksites section for additional information on establishing a respiratory protection program.\nDiscard disposable gloves after each cleaning. For reusable gloves, dedicate a pair for disinfecting surfaces to prevent the spread of COVID-19. After removing gloves, wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\nSome barriers (butyl rubber, natural rubber, neoprene rubber, nitrile rubber, and polyvinylchloride) may offer better protection for a variety of chemicals than other barriers. More information on recommended barriers for common disinfectants can be located on the CDC cleaning and disinfecting webpage.\nFor additional information, please see the Resources section at the end of this document.\n\nphone office light icon\nOffice staff\nReview the considerations in the CDC document COVID-19 Employer Information for Office Buildings.\nModify or adjust seats, furniture, and workstations to maintain social distancing of 6 feet between office staff, where possible and incorporating accessibility requirements.\nInstall transparent shields or other physical barriers, where possible, to separate office staff and visitors where social distancing is not an option.\nArrange chairs in reception or other communal seating areas, by turning, draping (covering chair with tape or fabric so seats cannot be used), spacing, or removing chairs, to maintain social distancing.\nUse methods to physically separate staff in all areas of the building, including work areas and other areas such as meeting rooms, break rooms, parking lots, entrance and exit areas, and locker rooms.\nUse signs, tape marks, or other visual cues, such as decals or colored tape on the floor, placed 6 feet apart, to show where to stand when physical barriers are not possible.\nReplace high-touch communal items, such as coffee pots and bulk snacks, with alternatives such as pre-packaged, single-serving items.

More frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required based on level of use.\nFor additional information, please see the Resources section at the end of this document.\n\napple alt light icon\nSchool nutrition staff\nThere is no evidence to indicate spread of COVID-19 through food. To maintain environments that are as safe as possible for school nutrition professionals, school administrators who oversee cafeterias and kitchens should review the following considerations to prevent the spread of COVID-19. These steps supplement the general considerations for protecting all school staff, presented above, and CDC\u2019s Considerations for Schools.\n\nProvide support for school nutrition professionals to protect themselves and others.\n\nConsider the following actions:\n\nAs feasible, have children eat meals in classrooms or outdoors, while maintaining social distance as much as possible, instead of in a communal dining hall or cafeteria.\nLimit offering any self-serve food or drink options, such as hot and cold food bars, salad or condiment bars, and drink stations. If possible, serve individually plated or pre-packaged meals instead.\nCreate physical barriers to protect school nutrition professionals and those they serve, including students and other school staff.\nUse tape to mark workstations (boxes or stripes on the floor) 6 feet apart in kitchens, food service, and food delivery points where interactions with students or other staff occur.\nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as kitchen countertops, refrigerator handles, cafeteria and service tables, door handles, carts, trays, tables, chairs, turnstiles, and countertops, throughout the day. Follow the directions on the cleaning product\u2019s label and wash hands afterwards to prevent skin irritation.\nTrain nutrition professional staff on protecting themselves and others. Consider conducting training virtually or, if in-person, ensure that physical distancing is maintained.\nPlace posters where they are likely to be seen, including in kitchens or common areas, that encourage staying home when sick, cough and sneeze etiquette, and good hand hygiene.\nProvide appropriate masks, gloves, and other appropriate equipment to provide protection from colleagues, students, and workspaces.\nFollow steps for safe meal preparation\nInstall plastic or plexiglass barriers between workstations to protect staff in situations where social distancing is difficult to maintain.\nPlan menus, production, and food preparation schedules to allow employees to maintain the recommended social distance of 6 feet while working, when possible.\nAssign one person for each task or workstation, as feasible.\nLimit the number of staff accessing storage areas or large equipment, like refrigerators.\nProvide tissues and no-touch disposal receptacles for use by staff.\nImplement a plan for curbside pickup of meals or contactless delivery service (if applicable, in event of school dismissal) to minimize contacts with students and their families, when possible.\nRequire staff to wear masks.\nFor additional information, please see the Resources section at the end of this document.\n\nuser nurse light icon\nSchool nurses/health professionals\nSimilar to other school employees, school nurses/healthcare professionals should be familiar with the general recommendations for all school employees. They should also be familiar with Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Healthcare Personnel During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic. Some of the topics that are most relevant to the school clinic setting include:\n\nTraining on the use and care of PPE. School administrators should select appropriate PPE and provide it to school nurses/health professionals in accordance with OSHA PPE standards (29 CFR 1910 Subpart I).external icon School nurses/health professionals must receive training on and demonstrate an understanding of:\nwhen to use PPE\nwhat PPE is necessary\nhow to properly don, use, and doff PPE in a manner to prevent self-contamination\nhow to properly dispose of or disinfect and maintain PPE\nthe limitations of PPE\nRecommended infection prevention and control (IPC) practices for routine healthcare delivery during the pandemic, which include:\nScreen and triage everyone entering a healthcare facility (e.g., nurse\u2019s office, school-based health center/clinic (SBHC)) for signs and symptoms of COVID-19.\nImplement universal source control measures.\nLimit occupancy in health offices and isolation rooms to adhere to physical distancing guidance, as much as possible.\nPractice hand hygiene.\nEnsure enhanced ventilation in health care delivery spaces in schools or relocate them into workspaces with enhanced ventilation.\nRefer to the recommended IPC practices (covered in the section above, Managing sick staff and students).\nImplement universal use of PPE for school healthcare staff.\nProvide appropriate PPE, at no cost, to healthcare staff.\nSurgical facemasks are preferred over other masks for HCPs, as surgical facemasks offer both source control and protection for the wearer against exposure to fluids, respiratory droplets, and large particles from others.\nEye protection in areas with moderate to substantial community transmission.\nFor aerosol generating procedures (AGPs), an N95 or equivalent or higher-level respirator is recommended instead of a surgical facemask. However, AGPs should rarely be necessary in school clinics.\nSpecial considerations should be given to children with asthma who use \u201cbreathing treatments\u201d or peak flow meters. In brief:\nDue to limited availability of data, it is uncertain whether aerosols generated by nebulizer treatments are potentially infectious. During the COVID-19 pandemic, nebulizer treatments at school should be reserved for children who cannot use or do not have access to an inhaler (with or without spacer or face mask).\nUse of peak flow meters, including in the school setting, includes forceful exhalation. Based on limited available data, forceful exhalation is not considered an aerosol-generating procedure associated with increased risk of transmitting the virus that causes COVID-19. However, for some people with asthma, using a peak flow meter can trigger cough.\nTrain healthcare staff on correct use of PPE.\nPractice environmental infection control (refer to the Cleaning and disinfection in K-12 school worksites section above).\nMore details about all of the topics in the list above can be found in Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Healthcare Personnel During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic.\n\nFor additional information, please see the Resources section at the end of this document.\n\nbus light icon\nSchool bus drivers and bus aides\nSchool bus drivers and bus aides, as well as other school staff, have the potential to come into contact with the virus that causes COVID-19 by:\n\nBeing in close contact with other people at the worksite, which can include students, coworkers, and maintenance workers.\nAssisting passengers with a disability.\nTouching or handling high-contact surfaces and equipment and then touching their face, mouth, nose, or eyes.\nSchool systems can implement a number of strategies to reduce risk of transmission on buses:\n\nWhenever possible, drivers and aides should open bus windows to increase circulation of outdoor air, but not if doing so might pose a safety or health risk (e.g., risk of falling).\nSchool bus drivers and bus aides should practice all safety actions and protocols as indicated for other school staff (e.g., hand hygiene). Similar to other frequently touched surfaces, bus surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected after each use of the bus using EPA-approved disinfectantsexternal icon. Special care should be exercised when performing disinfection to avoid overexposures to disinfectants in poorly ventilated buses.\nSchools should consider having spare masks available to ensure all students wear masks on the school bus.\nDuring dismissal, schools should provide physical guides, such as signs or tape on the sidewalk, to help students and school staff remain at least 6 feet apart while waiting for transportation. Whenever circumstances safely allow, waiting for transportation should take place outdoors.\nEstablish, where possible, physical barriers between school bus drivers and students.\nUse strip curtains, plastic barriers, or similar materials to create impermeable dividers or partitions.\nConsider leaving seats near the driver open if barriers cannot be used.\nConsider making foot-traffic unidirectional in narrow or confined areas in the bus to encourage social distancing. For example, by loading the bus from back to front and unloading from front to back.\nPlace hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol at the entrance of the school bus and encourage safe use when getting on/off the bus for driver and students.\nUse touch-free stations where possible.\nSupervise young children when they use hand sanitizer.\nProvide disposable disinfecting wipes and other cleaning materials and conduct targeted and more frequent cleaning of frequently touched surfaces (wheelchair lifts, wheelchair securements, handrails, and areas in the driver cockpit commonly touched by the driver).\nMaintain social distancing in the bus, including at entry doors.\nLimit the number of students in the bus at one time. Consult state and local guidance, if available.\nDrivers and aides should create distance between children on school buses, including seating children one student per row facing forward and skipping rows between students. Children from the same household can sit together, if needed.\nIt may be difficult to maintain physical distancing by school bus drivers and attendants who are required by state regulation to exit the bus to help students cross the street or assist students while on the bus. A balance for crossing streets safely, caring for the student, and keeping a safe physical distance is encouraged. Use of more protective masks would help decrease risk of transmission. See the Special Considerations \u2013 Teachers, substitute teachers, paraprofessionals, and specialists section above.\nEncourage using masks. However, masks should not be worn by drivers and aides if their use creates a new risk (e.g., interference with driving or vision, contribution to heat-related illness) that exceeds their COVID-19 related benefits of slowing the spread of the virus.\nFor additional information, please see the Resources section at the end of this document.\n\nrunning light icon\nCoaching staff and athletic trainers\nAdministrators should make decisions about restarting extracurricular athletic activities, in collaboration with local health officials, based on a number of factors. These factors include the level of community transmission, whether cases are identified among students, teachers, or staff, and what other indicators local public health officials are using to follow COVID-19. In addition, administrators should consider the transmission risk of the particular sport (e.g., cross country and tennis generally pose a lower risk than wrestling, outdoor sports generally pose a lower risk than indoor sports, etc.) and the ability to mitigate transmission risk, and whether student, teacher, and staff cohorts are being used in the school.\n\nCoaching staff and athletic trainers might come into contact with the virus that causes COVID-19 by:\n\nBeing in close contact with other people at the worksite, which can include coworkers and students.\nTouching or handling high-contact surfaces and equipment, and then touching their face, mouth, nose, or eyes.\nSchool systems can implement a number of strategies to reduce COVID-19 risk for coaching staff and athletic trainers:\n\nDevelop plans to communicate with students, parents, and staff regarding modifications to gym or exercise facilities.\nModify or adjust cardio equipment, free weight areas, weight training equipment, and classrooms to maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet between students and coaching staff and athletic trainers.\nEstablish, where possible, physical barriers between staff and between staff and students for training, practices, and competitions.\nInstall cleanable, transparent shields or other barriers to physically separate coaching staff and athletic trainers and students where distancing is not an option (e.g., between pieces of equipment that cannot be moved).\nUse strip curtains, plastic barriers, or similar materials to create impermeable dividers or partitions.\nEncourage social distancing of at least 6 feet between staff and students in all areas of the facility such as work-out areas, classrooms, pools, courts, walking/running tracks, locker rooms, parking lots, and in entrance/exit areas.\nEncourage social distancing during all workout activities.\nConsider making foot-traffic unidirectional in narrow or confined areas, such as aisles and stairwells, to encourage single-file movement at a distance of 6 feet or more.\nProvide disposable disinfecting wipes and other cleaning materials and conduct targeted and more frequent cleaning of frequently touched surfaces (free weights, exercise equipment, cardio machines, locker rooms (if in use), vending machines, railings and door handles, countertops, doorknobs, toilets, tables, light switches, phones, faucets, sinks, keyboards, etc.).\nClean and disinfect all exercise equipment and tools between users.\nConsider removing hard-to-clean items and equipment, such as exercise bands, rubber mats, foam rollers, and yoga blocks.\nConsider opening sections of the facility in phases.\nKeep areas where social distancing is particularly challenging closed until local infection risks are lowered.\nDevelop plans to determine what conditions are necessary to open additional areas of the facility.\nWhen opening aquatic activity areas, consult CDC Considerations for Public Pools, Hot Tubs, and Water Playgrounds During COVID-19.\nConsider limiting locker room access to the restroom area only, prohibiting the use of shower and changing areas.\nConsider closing water stations and water fountains if students have alternative water access.\nEncourage staff (and students) to bring their own water bottles to minimize use and touching of water fountains or consider installing no-touch activation methods for water fountains.\nDetermine if any additional modifications can be made to minimize the risk of transmission, such as reducing class sizes, moving to larger areas or holding classes outdoors, and removing shared yoga mats and asking students to bring their own.\nConsider mask use where feasible (refer to Considerations for Wearing Masks) when engaging in high impact activities.\nConsider having coaches use a portable amplifier to keep voices at a low, conversational volume.\nFor additional information, please see the Resources section at the end of this page.\n\naudio icon\nMusic, choir, and performing arts teachers\nAdministrators should make decisions about restarting extracurricular performing arts activities, in collaboration with local health officials, based on a number of factors. These factors include the level of community transmission, whether cases are identified among students, teachers, or staff, what other indicators local public health officials are using to follow COVID-19, and whether student, teacher, and staff cohorts are being implemented within the school.\n\nSinging or playing wind and brass instruments can generate respiratory droplets and aerosols that may contain the COVID-19 virus if a person is infected.\n\nSome general considerations for music and performing arts include:\n\nReinforce use of masks by all students and staff when not singing or playing an instrument that requires the use of their mouth (unless class is outdoors and distance can be maintained).\nConsider conducting the class in an outdoor/open environment or under an open tent.\nEnsure outdoor classes are safe from other hazards, such as heat, cold, and air pollution.\nIf the class is held indoors, ensure the ventilation system is optimized with regard to flow rate and filtration. Refer to the Ventilation section above for more information.\nConsider having teachers use a portable amplifier to keep voices at a low, conversational volume.\nLimit the number of students at one time in storage and backstage areas.\nInstall transparent shields or other physical barriers, where possible, to separate the students and staff.\nMaintain social distancing to protect students and staff.\nMusic instruction\nDevelop plans to communicate with students regarding safety expectations during music classes.\nPractice cohorting; rehearsals should be conducted in \u201cpods\u201d of students with the same 5-10 students always rehearsing together.\nLimit exchange (or sharing) of any instruments, parts, music sheets, or any other items.\nModify or adjust seating arrangements during music classes to allow for a minimum of 6 feet between students and music teachers. This may reduce the number of students that can fit in a performing arts classroom.\nEstablish, where possible, physical barriers between staff and between staff and students.\nInstall cleanable, transparent shields or other barriers to physically separate music staff and students.\nUse strip curtains, plastic barriers, or similar materials to create impermeable dividers or partitions.\nUse disposable absorbent pads or other receptacles, where possible, to catch the contents of spit valves; discard and clean properly after use.\nConsider using \u201cbell covers\u201d for the openings of brass instruments and specially designed bags with hand openings for woodwind instruments to minimize the generation of droplets and aerosols.\nTheater and dance\nLimit, where possible, sharing of props, costumes, and wigs.\nClean and disinfect dressing rooms, green rooms, and production areas using an EPA-registered household disinfectantexternal icon.\nConsider holding virtual or outdoor performances instead of indoor performances.\nReinforce social distancing and mask use for staff and students when students are not singing or playing an instrument that requires the use of their mouth (unless class is outdoors and distance can be maintained).",

            "Text": "Infections Among Children\nIncidence of COVID-19 in Children\nIn the United States and globally, fewer cases of COVID-19 have been reported in children (age 0-17 years) compared with  adults.1,2 While children comprise 22% of the US population,3 recent data show that 7.3% of all cases of COVID-19 in the United States reported to CDC were among children (as of August 3rd, 2020).4  The number and rate of cases in children in the United States have been steadily increasing from March to July 2020. The true incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is not known due to lack of widespread testing and the prioritization of testing for adults and those with severe illness. Hospitalization rates in children are significantly lower than hospitalization rates in adults with COVID-19, suggesting that children may have less severe illness from COVID-19 compared to adults.5, 6 Visit CDC\u2019s Cases, Data, and Surveillance page for current CDC data.\n\nInfections and Transmission Among Children\nIt is unclear whether children are as susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 compared with adults and whether they can transmit the virus as effectively as adults. Recent evidence suggests that children likely have the same or higher viral loads in their nasopharynx compared with adults7 and that children can spread the virus effectively in households and camp settings.8,9\n\nDue to community mitigation measures and school closures, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to and among children may have been reduced in the United States during the pandemic in the spring and early summer of 2020. This may explain the low incidence in children compared with adults. Comparing trends in pediatric infections before and after the return to in-person school and other activities may provide additional understanding about infections in children.\n\nSymptoms and Severity of COVID-19 in Children\nClinical Presentation\nThe incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be about the same for children as in adults, at 2-14 days with an average of 6 days.10\n\nSigns or symptoms of COVID-19 in children include:\n\nFever\nFatigue\nHeadache\nMyalgia\nCough\nNasal congestion or rhinorrhea\nNew loss of taste or smell\nSore throat\nShortness of breath or difficulty breathing\nAbdominal pain\nDiarrhea\nNausea or vomiting\nPoor appetite or poor feeding\nChildren infected with SARS-CoV-2 may have many of these non-specific symptoms, may only have a few (such as only upper respiratory symptoms or only gastrointestinal symptoms), or may be asymptomatic. The most common symptoms in children are cough and/or fever.11-15 A recent systematic review estimated that 16% of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection are asymptomatic,16 but evidence suggests that as many as 45% of pediatric infections are asymptomatic.17 The signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in children are similar to other infections and noninfectious processes, including influenza, streptococcal pharyngitis, and allergic rhinitis. The lack of specificity of signs or symptoms and the significant proportion of asymptomatic infections make symptom-based screening for identification of SARS-CoV-2 in children particularly challenging.17\n\nSeverity of Illness in Children\nWhile children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are less likely to develop severe illness compared with adults, children are still at risk of developing severe illness and complications from COVID-19. Recent COVID-19 hospitalization surveillance data shows that the rate of hospitalization among children is low (8.0 per 100,000 population) compared with that in adults (164.5 per 100,000 population), but hospitalization rates in children are increasing. 5  While children have lower rates of mechanical ventilation and death than adults, 1 in 3 children hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States were admitted to the intensive care unit, which is the same in adults.5   \n\nCurrent evidence suggests that children with certain underlying medical conditions and infants (age <1 year) might be at increased risk for severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection.10,11,14 Of the children who have developed severe illness from COVID-19, most have had underlying medical conditions. 5\n\nThere is limited evidence about which underlying medical conditions in children might increase the risk for severe illness. Current evidence suggests that children with medical complexity, with genetic, neurologic, metabolic conditions, or with congenital heart disease might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Similar to adults, children with obesity, diabetes, asthma and chronic lung disease, sickle cell disease, or immunosuppression might also be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.\nWhile healthcare providers should maintain a high index of suspicion for SARS-CoV-2 infection in these populations and monitor the progression of illness closely, it appears that most infants18 and children with certain underlying conditions such as cancer19 who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 do not usually develop severe illness.\nHospitalization rates in the United States are higher among Hispanic/Latino children and black, non-Hispanic children and non-Hispanic black children compared with white children, which may be related to the higher rates of obesity and other underlying conditions among these populations.5\nSimilar to adults, children with severe COVID-19 may develop respiratory failure, myocarditis, shock, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, and multi-organ system failure. Some children with COVID-19 have developed other serious problems like intussusception or diabetic ketoacidosis.10,14, 20,21 Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are also at risk for developing multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).22 For the case definition, recommended evaluation, and current data on MIS-C cases in the United States, visit MIS-C Information for Healthcare Providers.\n\nTesting and Recommendations for Isolation\nViral tests (nucleic acid or antigen) are recommended to diagnose acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. Testing strategies, including clinical criteria for considering testing and recommended specimen type, are the same for children and adults. CDC\u2019s guidance for the evaluation and management of neonates at risk for COVID-19 details specific testing considerations for newborns.\n\nFor more information on CDC\u2019s recommendations for isolation, which apply to children and adults, visit: discontinuing precautions and disposition of patients with COVID-19 in healthcare settings and discontinuation of home isolation for people not in healthcare settings.\n\nTesting, Isolation, and Quarantine for School-Aged Children\nAs children return to school and other in-person activities, pediatric healthcare providers should be prepared to answer questions from families about testing and when it is safe to return to school or be with people outside the household. Review CDC\u2019s information for school administrators on symptom screening and testing for children in school as well as CDC\u2019s Community Mitigation framework.\n\nSchool-aged children should be prioritized for viral testing if they have:\n\nSigns or symptoms of COVID-19 and\nclose contact (within 6 feet of someone for a total of 15 minutes or more) with a person with laboratory confirmed or probable SARS-CoV-2 infection or\nincreased likelihood for exposure (which includes living in or traveling to a community with substantial transmission as defined by the local public health department  and described in CDC\u2019s Community Mitigation framework)\nNo symptoms but have had close contact (within 6 feet of someone for a total of 15 minutes or more) with a person with laboratory confirmed or probable SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nChildren with symptoms of an infectious disease should not attend school, but the length of time the child should stay home depends on the most likely etiology of illness (COVID-19 or not). Return to school policies for children with COVID-19 should be based on CDC\u2019s recommendation for discontinuation of home isolation. A negative test or doctor\u2019s note should not be required for return to school upon completion of the 10 days of isolation with improvement of symptoms.\n\nIf the child has symptoms of COVID-19, but the child has not had close contact (within 6 feet of someone for a total of 15 minutes or more) with a person with laboratory confirmed or probable SARS-CoV-2 infection and the child does not have an increased likelihood for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (which includes living in or traveling to a community with substantial transmission), he or she should be evaluated for other disease processes.\u200b If the child is determined to likely not have COVID-19 by a healthcare provider, he/she should be allowed to return to school according to existing school policies for non-COVID illnesses. Examples of non-COVID return to school policies include resolution of fever without antipyretics for 24 hours for non-COVID viral illnesses or after initiation of antibiotics for bacterial illnesses.\nIf the child has symptoms of COVID-19 and has increased likelihood for exposure (which includes living in or traveling to a community with substantial transmission), he or she should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, if possible. If the test result is negative, the child should be allowed to return to school once their symptoms of illness have improved consistent with non-COVID return to school policies. If testing cannot be obtained, the child should be considered a presumed case of COVID-19 and should isolate according to CDC\u2019s recommendations for discontinuation of home isolation.\nIf the child has had close contact to someone with SARS-CoV-2, he or she should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 but must remain in quarantine for the 14-day incubation period even if results are negative, in accordance with CDC\u2019s Quarantine If You Might Be Sick.\nLaboratory and Radiographic Findings of COVID-19\nTypical laboratory findings in children with COVID-19 include mild abnormalities in white blood cell count (either increased or decreased lymphocyte counts), mildly elevated inflammatory markers (including procalcitonin), and mildly elevated liver enzymes.23 Radiologic findings in children with COVID-19 include unilateral or bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph or CT, ground-glass opacities on CT, and consolidation with surrounding Halo sign on CT.23,24 CT should be used sparingly and only for hospitalized, symptomatic patients with specific clinical indications. For more information, see recommendations from the American College of Radiologyexternal icon.\n\nManagement of COVID-19 in Children\nPediatric healthcare providers should consider the child\u2019s clinical presentation, requirement for supportive care, underlying medical conditions, and the ability for caregivers to care for the child at home when deciding whether the child may need inpatient care for COVID-19. For more information, visit Guidance for home care of people not requiring hospitalization for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Provide parents resources on emergency warning signs for COVID-19 and caring for someone at home.\n\nCurrently, there are no specific drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of COVID-19. Treatment of COVID-19 remains largely supportive and includes prevention and management of complications. Remdesivirexternal icon, which has shown benefits in clinical trials in adults, is currently available through Emergency Use Authorization or compassionate use programs for children. The safety and effectiveness of remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19 has not yet been evaluated in children. Additionally, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggests that dexamethasoneexternal icon may be beneficial in pediatric patients with COVID-19 respiratory disease who are on mechanical ventilation. For more information, review considerations for childrenexternal icon in NIH\u2019s COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines.25\n\nFor information on evaluation and management of MIS-C, visit MIS-C Information for Healthcare Providers.\n\nIt is important to remember that children infected with SARS-CoV-2 can present with other serious conditions such as  diabetic ketoacidosis or intussusception, and a broad differential must be maintained in evaluating ill children during the COVID-19 pandemic.10,14,20,21,26-29 Standard evaluation and management of co-occurring conditions should be maintained for a child infected with SARS-CoV-2, with additional infection control measures. Pediatric providers should have an appropriate suspicion for COVID-19, but also to continue to consider and test for other diagnoses, such as community acquired pneumoniaexternal icon and influenza (see CDC\u2019s Flu Information for Healthcare Professionals for more information).\n\nCDC has specific guidance for inpatient obstetric healthcare settings and the evaluation and management of neonates at risk for COVID-19. Additionally, several other organizations have published guidelines related to the treatment and management of adult and pediatric patients with COVID-19:\n\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH) Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Treatment Guidelinesexternal icon\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) Interim Guidance on Clinical Management of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection when Novel Coronavirus (nCoV) Infection is Suspectedexternal icon\nSurviving Sepsis Campaign International Guidelines for the Management of Septic Shock and Sepsis-Associated Organ Dysfunction in Childrenexternal icon\nInfectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines on the Treatment and Management of Patients with COVID-19external icon\nImmunizations and Well-Child Care\nCommunity mitigation measures such as shelter-in-place orders resulted in declines in outpatient pediatric visits and fewer vaccine doses administered during the early COVID-19 pandemic,30 leaving children at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases. Healthcare providers should work with families to keep children up to date with all recommended vaccinations, especially with influenza vaccinations for the 2020-2021 influenza season. For more information on influenza, visit CDC\u2019s Influenza page. For more information on immunization services and vaccination recommendations during the pandemic, visit Vaccination Guidance.\n\nHealthcare providers should identify children who have missed well-child visits and/or recommended vaccinations and contact them to schedule in-person appointments, with prioritization of infants, children age < 24 months and school-aged children. Developmental surveillance and early childhood screenings, including developmental and autism screening, should continue along with referrals for early intervention services and further evaluation if concerns are identified.\n\nAll newborns should be seen by a pediatric healthcare provider shortly after hospital discharge (three to five days of age). Ideally, newborn visits should be done in-person, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, to evaluate feeding and weight gain, check for dehydration and jaundice, ensure all components of newborn screening were completed with appropriate confirmatory testing and follow-up, and evaluate maternal well-being. All healthcare facilities should ensure infection prevention and control policies are in place to minimize chance of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 among providers, patients, and families. For specific recommendations by healthcare facility type and level of community transmission, review Infection Control Guidance for Healthcare Professionals. CDC has additional trainings and information about potential exposures in the workplace for healthcare providers.\n\nPediatric healthcare providers should incorporate education on everyday infection prevention measures, such as the importance of proper hand hygiene, social distancing, and wearing masks when in public, as well as information on stress and coping during the pandemic in their regular anticipatory guidance with children and their families. Pediatric healthcare providers should educate patients and families about infection prevention policies that exist in clinics, emergency departments, hospitals, and clinics. Remind people to seek emergency care immediately, if indicated, as delaying care may cause harm.\n\nPrimary care practices should continue to use infection prevention strategies including:\n\nScheduling sick visits and well-child visits during different times of the day\nReducing crowding in waiting rooms, by asking patients to remain outside (e.g., stay in their vehicles, if applicable) until they are called into the facility for their appointment, or setting up triage booths to screen patients safely\nConsidering telemedicine for visits that do not involve vaccination or do not require an in-person physical exam.

If at any time a facility intends to report a patient-specific test result, it must first obtain a CLIA certificate and meet all requirements to perform testing. For more information, see the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services\u2019 (CMS) Research Testing and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) Regulationspdf iconexternal icon and the CDC Division of Laboratory Systems\u2019 CLIA webpage.\n\nFor information about the CLIA Certificate application process, see CMS\u2019 How to Apply for a CLIA Certificate, Including International Laboratoriesexternal icon webpage.\n\nFor definitions of COVID-19 diagnostic, screening, and surveillance testing, see CDC\u2019s Interim Guidance for Use of Pooling Procedures in SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostic, Screening, and Surveillance Testing. How to report\nLaboratory data elements may be reported in the following ways:\n\nSubmit laboratory testing data directly to state or local public health departments according to state/or local law or policy. Data must be sent using existing reporting channels to ensure rapid initiation of case investigations, and concurrent reporting of results must be shared with ordering provider or patient, as applicable.\nSubmit laboratory testing data to state and local public health departments through a centralized platform (such as the Association of Public Health Laboratories\u2019 AIMS platformexternal icon), where the data will then be routed to the appropriate state and local authorities and routed to CDC after removal of personally identifiable information according to applicable rules and regulations.\nSubmit laboratory testing data through a state or regional Health Information Exchange (HIE) to the appropriate state or local public health department and then to CDC as directed by the state.\nPublic health departments will submit de-identified data to CDC on a daily basis, using either Health Level 7 (HL7) messaging or the CDC-provided CSV format. What to report\nComplete laboratory data must include the following data elements for state and jurisdictional health departments.\n\nTest ordered \u2013 use harmonized LOINC codes provided by CDC\nDevice Identifier\nTest result\u2013use appropriate LOINC and SNOMED codes, as defined by the Laboratory In Vitro Diagnostics (LIVD) Test Code Mapping for SARS-CoV-2 Tests provided by CDC\nTest Result date (date format)\nAccession # / Specimen ID\nPatient age\nPatient race\nPatient ethnicity\nPatient sex\nPatient residence zip code\nPatient residence county\nOrdering provider name and NPI (as applicable)\nOrdering provider zip\nPerforming facility name and CLIA number\nPerforming facility zip code\nSpecimen Source \u2013 use appropriate LOINC, SNOMED-CT, or SPM4 codes, or equivalently detailed alternative codes\nDate test ordered (date format)\nDate specimen collected (date format)\nThe following additional demographic data elements should also be collected and reported to state or local public health departments.\n\nPatient name (Last name, First name, Middle Initial)\nPatient street address\nPatient phone number with area code\nPatient date of birth\nOrdering provider address\nOrdering provider phone number\nTo protect patient privacy, any data that state and jurisdictional health departments send to CDC will be deidentified and will not include some patient-level information. The deidentified data shared with CDC will contribute to understanding COVID-19\u2019s impact, positivity trends, testing coverage, and will help identify supply chain issues for reagents and other materials.\n\nHow to report using standard terminology\nCDC has posted a LOINC In-Vitro Diagnostic (LIVD) Test Code Mapping Guide for COVID-19 test results for tests with emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that can be used by clinical laboratories and instrument manufacturers. This specification supports the use of standardized LOINC and SNOMED Clinical Terms (CT) codes to improve the accuracy of reporting tests for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Using these harmonized LOINC and SNOMED-CT codes helps ensure that the same type of test is represented uniformly across the United States.\n\nFor those COVID-19 tests that have not yet received FDA emergency use authorization, CDC encourages test developers and laboratories that use COVID-19 tests to work together to obtain appropriate and interoperable LOINC and SNOMED-CT codes for reporting purposes.\n\nLOINC codes must be used to represent the \u201cquestion\u201d a viral test asks of a specimen (e.g., does this specimen have SARS-CoV-2 RNA?), and SNOMED-CT codes must be used to represent the diagnostic \u201canswer\u201d (e.g., what was detected?). More background on these terminology standards can be found here:\n\nLOINC Term external icon\nSNOMED CT external icon\nWhenever possible, laboratories must use standard codes that already exist. Before requesting a new code, search the list of currently available LOINC external icon for SARS-CoV-2 tests. If a LOINC test code cannot be identified whose attributes appropriately match the test for which coding is needed, new terms can be submitted, and a new code requested through the LOINCexternal icon.\n\nTechnical assistance for electronic reporting Electronic reporting options are available to reduce the burden on providers reporting test results. Laboratories that are not currently reporting electronically to their state or local health department and want assistance in establishing electronic reporting can contact CDC\u2019s Emergency Operations Center, Laboratory Reporting Working Group at eocevent405@cdc.gov.",

            "Text": "On August 3, 2020, CDC updated its isolation guidance based on the latest science about COVID-19 showing that people can continue to test positive for up to 3 months after diagnosis and not be infectious to others.  Contrary to media reporting today, this science does not imply a person is immune to reinfection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the 3 months following infection.  The latest data simply suggests that retesting someone in the 3 months following initial infection is not necessary unless that person is exhibiting the symptoms of COVID-19 and the symptoms cannot be associated with another illness.\n\nPeople with COVID-19 should be isolated for at least 10 days after symptom onset and until 24 hours after their fever subsides without the use of fever-reducing medications.\n\nThere have been more than 15 international and U.S.-based studies recently published looking at length of infection, duration of viral shed, asymptomatic spread and risk of spread among various patient groups.  Researchers have found that the amount of live virus in the nose and throat drops significantly soon after COVID-19 symptoms develop.  Additionally, the duration of infectiousness in most people with COVID-19 is no longer than 10 days after symptoms begin and no longer than 20 days in people with severe illness or those who are severely immunocompromised.\n\nCDC will continue to closely monitor the evolving science for information that would warrant reconsideration of these recommendations.",

            "Text": "CDC wants to learn more about the percentage of people in the United States who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 and to better understand how the virus is spreading through the U.S. population over time. Because infected people can have mild illness or may not get medical care or testing, CDC also wants to use this information to estimate the number of people who have been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and were not included in official case counts. To help answer those questions and others, CDC is collaborating with public health and private partners on a variety of seroprevalence surveys of different sizes, locations, populations studied, and purposes.\n\nSeroprevalence surveys use serology tests to identify people in a population or community that have antibodies against an infectious disease. Antibodies are specific proteins made in response to infections. Antibodies are detected in the blood of people who are tested after infection; they show an immune response to the infection. Antibody test results are especially important for detecting previous infections in people who had few or no symptoms. It is not known yet if having antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 can protect someone from getting infected again, or, if they do, how long this protection might last. CDC and its partners plan to study this issue.\n\nCDC is conducting seroprevalence surveys called \u201clarge-scale geographic seroprevalence surveys\u201d in locations across the United States. The first seroprevalence surveys began in areas that first reported community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States; they are now being expanded to more regions. Descriptions of these surveys are provided below.\n\nCommercial Laboratory Survey\nResults from ten sites\nCDC has received results from all of Connecticut, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, the New York City metro area, Philadelphia, San Francisco Bay area, South Florida, Utah and Western Washington State from blood samples collected by commercial laboratories as part of routine patient care. In addition, CDC has results from a 2nd and 3rd later, time period, which are included on the interactive website.\n\nAs more data become available, tables and data charts will be added to this page to show the early antibody test results for patient specimens tested in these areas.\n\nThis survey will continue to collect additional samples from selected areas over time.\nResults from a 2nd period of specimen collection (\u201cRound 2\u201d) are shown for 8 of 10 sites.\nResults from a 3rd period of specimen collection (\u201cRound 3\u201d) are shown for 7 of 10 sites.\nThe survey will expand to include testing of samples from patients in additional geographic areas.\nThe interactive dashboard below will be regularly updated as new seroprevalence survey results become available.",

            "Text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness (see list of symptoms) caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. Here\u2019s what we currently know:\n\nThe main way the virus spreads is from person-to-person through respiratory droplets when people cough, sneeze, or talk.\nYou may also be able to get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.\nThe virus may be spread by people who are not experiencing symptoms.\nMore Info for Gyms and Fitness Centers\nEmployees and Staff\nCOVID-19 can sometimes cause serious complications. People at an increased risk for severe illness include:\n\nOlder adults\nPeople of any age who have underlying medical conditions\nAs a gym and fitness center employer, your workforce might be exposed to the virus when:\n\nIn close contact (within less than 6 feet) with other people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus at the worksite, which can include coworkers, patrons, or service providers.\nTouching or handling frequently touched surfaces and equipment, and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.\nHow You Can Protect Your Staff and Others and Slow the Spread\nEvaluate your workplace to identify scenarios where workers cannot maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet from each other, patrons, or service providers. Use appropriate combinations of controls following the hierarchy of controls to address these situations to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. A committee of both workers and management may be most effective at identifying all possible scenarios.\n\nWhile protecting workers, it is important to note that control recommendations or interventions to reduce risk of COVID-19 must be compatible with any safety programs and personal protective equipment (PPE) normally required for the job task. Approaches to consider may include the following:\n\nCreate a COVID-19 Workplace Health and Safety Plan\n\nReview the CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers and the Resuming Business Toolkit for guidelines and recommendations that all employers can use to protect their employees.\n\nContinue to follow any state or local regulations for gyms and fitness centers in addition to the recommendations here.\nIdentify an on-site workplace coordinator who will be responsible for COVID-19 assessment and control.\nWhen developing plans, include all employees in the workplace, for example: operational staff, utility employees, janitorial staff, maintenance, supervisory staff, lifeguards, childcare staff, personal trainers, fitness instructors, and swim instructors, even if part-time, temporary, or visiting instructors.\nDevelop plans to communicate with patrons regarding modification to gym operation processes.\nNotify all employees that any COVID-19 concerns should be directed to the identified coordinator.\nImplement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices.\nDevelop policies that encourage sick employees to stay at home without fear of reprisals, and ensure employees are aware of these policies.\nIf contractors are employed in the workplace, develop plans to communicate with the contracting company regarding changes to work processes.\nConsider conducting daily in-person or virtual health checks (e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening) of employees on scheduled workdays.\nScreening options could include having employees self-screen before arriving at work or having on-site screening by taking employees\u2019 temperatures and assessing other potential symptoms prior to beginning work. (see CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers)\nMake sure employees can maintain at least 6 feet of distance while waiting for screening if done on-site.\nMake employee health screenings as private as possible and maintain the confidentiality of each individual\u2019s medical status and history.\nTake action if an employee is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19\n\nImmediately separate employees who report with or develop COVID-19 symptoms at work from other employees and arrange for private transport home. These employees should self-isolate and contact their healthcare provider immediately.\nPerform enhanced cleaning and disinfection after anyone suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 has been in the workplace. Cleaning staff should clean and disinfect offices, bathrooms, common areas, and shared equipment used by the sick person, focusing especially on frequently touched surfaces or objects. If other workers do not have access to these areas or items, wait 24 hours (or as long as possible) before cleaning and disinfecting.\nEmployees who test positive for COVID-19 should immediately notify their employer of their results.\nSick employees should follow CDC recommended steps to self-isolate or seek care. Employees should not return to work until they meet the criteria to discontinue home isolation, in consultation with healthcare providers.\nDevelop hazard controls using the hierarchy of controls to prevent infection among workers. You may be able to include a combination of controls noted below.\n\nEngineering Controls (Isolate people from the hazards)\nAlter the workspace using engineering controls to prevent exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19.\nModify or adjust cardio equipment, free weight areas, weight training equipment, and fitness classrooms to maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet between patrons and employees.\nIf rearranging is not an option, place \u201cdo not use\u201d signage and turn-off/unplug select equipment to allow for proper social distancing.\nMove electronic payment terminals/card readers farther away from the attendant to increase the distance between the patron and the attendant.\nWhere possible, establish physical barriers between workers, and between workers and patrons.\nInstall cleanable transparent shields or other barriers to physically separate employees and patrons where distancing is not an option (e.g., between pieces of equipment that cannot be moved).\nUse strip curtains, plastic barriers, or similar materials to create impermeable dividers or partitions.\nClose or limit access to common areas where employees are likely to gather and interact, such as break rooms, outside the entrance, and in entrance/exit areas.\nEncourage social distancing of at least 6 feet between patrons and employees in all areas of the facility, such as workout areas, classrooms, pools and saunas, courts, walking/running tracks, locker rooms, parking lots, and in entrance/exit areas.\nIf your gym has restaurants or juice bars, consult CDC restaurant guidance.\nConsider making foot-traffic single direction in narrow or confined areas, such as aisles and stairwells, to encourage single-file movement at a 6-foot distance.\nUse visual cues such as floor decals, colored tape, and signs to remind workers and patrons to maintain distance of at least 6 feet from others, including around training equipment, free weight areas, at employee workstations, and in break areas.\nPlace handwashing stations or hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol in multiple locations throughout the workplace for workers and patrons.\nUse touch-free stations, where possible.\nMake sure restrooms are well stocked with soap and drying materials.\nMake sure the gym is well-ventilatedexternal icon.\nWork with facilities management to adjust the ventilation so that the maximum amount of fresh air is delivered to occupied spaces while maintaining the humidity at 40-60%. If possible, increase filter efficiency of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) units to highest functional level.\nPortable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration units may be considered to remove contaminants in the air of poorly ventilated areas.\nIf free standing fans are used, position them in a way that does not direct air from one patron to another.\nAdditional considerations for improving the building ventilation system can be found in the CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers.\nAdministrative Controls (Change the way people work)\nProvide training and other administrative policies to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\nAll workers should have a basic understanding of COVID-19, how the disease is thought to spread, what the symptoms of the disease are, and what measures can be taken to prevent or minimize transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19.\nTrainings should include the importance of social distancing (maintaining a distance of 6 feet or more when possible), wearing cloth face coverings or masks appropriately, covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands, cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces, not sharing personal items or tools/equipment unless absolutely necessary, and not touching their face, mouth, nose, or eyes.\nWorkers should be encouraged to go home or stay home if they feel sick. Ensure that sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance, and that employees are aware of and understand these policies.\nConsider maintaining small groups of workers in teams (cohorting) to reduce the number of coworkers each person is exposed to.\nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.\nIf surfaces are visibly dirty, clean them using a detergent or soap and water before you disinfect them.\nUse products that are EPA-registeredexternal icon, diluted household bleach solutions, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, appropriate for surface disinfection.\nProvide sanitizing disposable wipes and other cleaning materials and conduct targeted and more frequent cleaning of frequently touched surfaces and objects (free weights, exercise equipment, cardio machines, time clocks, break room tables and chairs, locker rooms [if in use], vending machines, railings, and door handles, countertops, doorknobs, toilets, tables, light switches, phones, faucets, sinks, keyboards, etc.)\nClean and disinfect all exercise equipment and tools between patrons.\nProvide disinfecting wipes and/or paper towels and disinfectant for patrons to use before and after exercising at each location/station/piece of equipment. Gym patrons should be encouraged to clean equipment before and after use.\nConsider removing hard-to-clean items and equipment such as bands, rubber mats, foam rollers, and yoga blocks.\nUse devices that do not require the employee to handle patron credit and debit cards and institute a cashless policy. If this is not possible, ensure that cash and/or cards are handled with care by employees either by changing gloves between each transaction or using hand sanitizer between patrons.\nProvide employees adequate time and access to soap, clean water, and single use drying materials for handwashing.\nRemind employees to wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, they should use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.\nProvide hand sanitizer, tissues, and no-touch waste baskets at the cash registers and in the restrooms.\nLimit the number of people in the facility at one time. (Consult state and local guidance if available.)\nConsider implementing limited or contactless online reservation and check-in/check-out systems that will limit the number of people in the facility at one time (employees should be included in the count).\nConsider offering or continuing to offer virtual classes and opportunities.\nStagger work shifts and break times where feasible to reduce the number of employees in common areas such as screening areas, break rooms, and locker rooms.\nReview current practices for all classes and fitness/training instruction while limiting and reducing the number of patrons in class settings.\nConsider opening sections of the facility in phases.\nKeep areas where social distancing is particularly challenging (e.g., locker rooms, courts/fields, and childcare areas) closed until conditions improve and infection risks are lowered.\nDevelop plans to determine what conditions are necessary to open additional areas of the facility.\nWhen opening aquatic activity areas, consult CDC Considerations for Public Pools, Hot Tubs, and Water Playgrounds During COVID-19.\nLimit locker room access to the restroom area only, prohibiting the use of shower and changing areas.\nConsider closing water stations and water fountains, except for no-touch bottle refill stations. Encourage patrons and employees to bring their own water bottle.\nDetermine if you can make any additional changes to minimize the risk of spreading the virus that causes COVID-19, such as reducing class sizes, discontinuing in-person group fitness classes, moving to larger areas or holding classes outdoors, and removing shared yoga mats and asking patrons to bring their own.\nRemind employees that people may be able to spread the virus even if they do not show symptoms. Consider all close interactions (within 6 feet) with employees, patrons, and others as a potential source of exposure.\nConsider closing waiting areas and discourage patrons from entering the facility prior to their reservation time, if possible.\nConsider assigning social distancing coaches to ensure that patrons are properly spaced during their workout.\nUse cloth face coverings or masks as appropriate.\nCloth face coverings or masks are intended to protect other people\u2014not the wearer. They are not considered to be personal protective equipment.\nEmphasize that care must be taken when putting on and taking off cloth face coverings or masks to ensure that the worker or the cloth face covering or mask does not become contaminated.\nCloth face coverings or masks should be routinely laundered.\nDo not wear cloth face coverings or masks if their use creates a new risk (i.e., interferes with driving or vision, or contributes to heat-related illness) that exceeds their COVID-19 related benefits of slowing the spread of the virus. Cloth face coverings or masks should also not be worn by anyone who has trouble breathing or is unable to remove it without assistance. CDC provides information on adaptions and alternatives that should be considered when cloth face coverings or masks may not be feasible.\nConsider requiring workplace visitors (service personnel, patrons) to also wear cloth face coverings or masks when feasible.\nPost signs and reminders at entrances and in strategic places providing instruction on social distancing, hand hygiene, use of cloth face coverings or masks, and cough and sneeze etiquette. Signs should be accessible for people with disabilities, easy to understand, and may include signs for non-English speakers, as needed.\nCommunication and training should be easy to understand, in preferred language(s) spoken or read by the employees and include accurate and timely information.\nEmphasize use of images (infographics) that account for language differences.\nReinforce training with signs (preferably infographics), placed in strategic locations. CDC has free, simple posters available to download and print, some of which are translated into different languages.\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE)\nPPE is the last step in the hierarchy of controls because it is more difficult to use effectively than other measures. To be protective and not introduce an additional hazard, the use of PPE requires characterization of the environment, knowledge of the hazard, training, and consistent correct use. Because of this, administrative and engineering controls are emphasized when addressing occupational hazards, including when applying guidance to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.\nIn the current COVID-19 pandemic, use of PPE such as surgical masks or N95 respirators is being prioritized for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance, unless they were required for the job before the pandemic.",

Here\u2019s what is currently known:\n\nIt mainly spreads from person to person.\nBetween people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet).\nThrough respiratory droplets produced when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, or talks.\nYou can get the virus from infected people who don\u2019t seem sick or show symptoms.\nYou may be able to get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus (SARS-CoV-2) on it and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.\nThe more closely you interact with others and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread.\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 can spread from people to animals after close contact. The risk of COVID-19 spreading from animals to people is considered to be low. Learn about COVID-19 and pets and other animals.\nAs an in-home service provider, you could be exposed to the virus during your work by:\n\nBeing in close contact (within 6 feet) with infected clients and others who live with them.\nTouching or handling contaminated surfaces or items and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.\nAs an in-home service client, you could be exposed to the virus in your home by:\n\nBeing in close contact (within 6 feet) with your service provider who is infected.\nTouching or handling items from outside your home and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.\nHow you can protect yourself and others to slow the spread\nFor Service Providers\nStay home if you are having symptoms consistent with COVID-19.\nFollow CDC recommended steps and isolate yourself if you are sick.\nTalk with your supervisor and do not return to work until it\u2019s safe. Check When You Can be Around Others After You Had or Likely Had COVID-19 and talk to your healthcare provider.\nFollow CDC recommended precautions and tell your supervisor that you have been exposed to a person with COVID-19 even if you are well.\nDo not work with clients in-person until at least 14 days after your last possible exposure to the virus.\nTake your temperature before the start of each work shift. Stay home if you have a fever of 100.4oF or greater and follow above steps.\nTelephone screen all clients for symptoms consistent with COVID-19 or exposure to a person with COVID-19 before each visit. Ask the client:\n\u201cIn the past two weeks have you or someone you live with had contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19?\u201d\n\u201cDo you have a fever or have you felt hot or feverish in the last two days?\u201d\n\u201cWere you able to take your temperature with a thermometer?\u201d\nIf yes, ask \u201cWhat was your temperature?\u201d and \u201cWhen did you take  it?\u201d\nNote: With COVID-19, fever can come and go, and some people might not have a fever at all. Fever is less likely in people with some underlying medical conditions, older adults, and people taking certain fever-reducing medications, such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and aspirin.\nIf no, ask \u201cAre you experiencing shaking, chills, or sweating? Do you feel warm to the touch?\u201d\n\u201cDo you have a new or worsening cough today?\u201d\n\u201cDo you have any of these other symptoms?\nShortness of breath or difficulty breathing\nFatigue\nMuscle or body aches\nHeadache\nNew loss of taste or smell\nSore throat\nCongestion or runny nose\nNausea or vomiting\nDiarrhea\u201d\nIf your client has been exposed, has symptoms, or tests positive for COVID-19:\nCancel your in-person appointment, unless you are an essential caregiver or aid. Encourage your client to contact their healthcare provider or help them contact their provider, if assistance is needed. Clients may need help accessing telehealth.\nEssential caregivers or aides: If hospitalization for your client is not needed, your client may require assistance with home care for COVID-19.\nSee guidance for implementing home care for people not requiring hospitalization.\nFollow recommended infection prevention and control measures, including the use of recommended personal protective equipment (PPE).\nIf there is potential that you may be splashed or sprayed by body fluids during your work, use standard precautions and PPE.\nBefore arriving at each client\u2019s home, evaluate yourself for symptoms.\nStay at least 6 feet away from clients and others in clients home, including pets, when possible.\nRemember that people may be able to spread SARS-CoV-2 even if they do not show symptoms.

Clinical criteria for considering testing for SARS-CoV-2 in animals is based on what is currently known about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and is subject to change as additional information becomes available.\n\nHuman patients with COVID-19 have symptoms that appear 2-14 days after exposure and include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals is currently unknown, but animals may present with a combination of respiratory symptoms or gastrointestinal illness based on presentation in a small number of animals and what is known about other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-13. Veterinarians should use their best judgment to determine if an animal has been exposed to people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and if the animal has clinical signs compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection3.

            "Text": "What do we currently know about animals and COVID-19?\nSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 in humans, is thought to be spread primarily through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking. There are also reports that people may be able to spread the virus while pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic. We are still learning about this novel zoonotic virus, and it appears that in some rare situations, human to animal transmission can occur.\n\nCDC is aware of a small number animals, including dogs and cats, reportedexternal icon to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 after close contact with people with COVID-19. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and CDC recently reported confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 in two pet cats with mild respiratory illness in New York, which were the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in companion animals in the United States. Both cats are expected to recover. The cats had close contact with people confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19, suggesting human-to-cat spread. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by SARS-CoV-2.\n\nLimited information is available to characterize the spectrum of clinical illness associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals. Clinical signs thought to be compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals include fever, coughing, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, lethargy, sneezing, nasal/ocular discharge, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\nAdvise veterinary clinic staff who are sick to stay home\nStaff who are sick\nFollow CDC\u2019s guidance on what to do if you are sick. Tell staff to stay home if they are sick.  Employees who appear to have COVID-19 symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, or shortness of breath) upon arrival at work or who become sick during the day should immediately be separated from other clinic employees, customers, and clients and sent home:\n\nStaff who are sick or who test positive for COVID-19 should isolate at home.\nStaff who are exposed\nInform the staff\u2019s team members if they have been exposed to someone who might have COVID-19, while maintaining confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act. Notify the local health department of the potential exposure as well.\n\nStaff who have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 should quarantine at home.\nNote: However, critical workers, like veterinarians and their staff, can be permitted to continue to work following a potential exposure to COVID-19, provided they remain asymptomatic and additional precautions are implemented to protect them and the workplace. Everyone who enters the clinic, including employees and visitors, should wear a mask over their nose and mouth to contain respiratory secretions, unless engaged in an activity that requires PPE.\n\nImplement sick leave policies for veterinary clinic staff that are flexible, nonpunitive, and consistent with public health guidance, allowing employees to stay home if they have symptoms of respiratory infection.\n\nFollow CDC guidelines for cleaning and disinfecting areas the sick employee visited. If possible, staff should each have their own workspace/equipment and avoid sharing desks/work tools. If these items must be shared, they should be frequently disinfected.\n\nSee also:  Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers to Plan and Respond to COVID-19\n\nPostpone non-urgent veterinary visits and elective procedures until regular business operations resume in your community\nMost jurisdictions recognize veterinary practices as essential and are allowing them to operate during the COVID-19 pandemic. To protect staff and preserve PPE and supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic, veterinary clinics should make considerations to protect both human and animal health. Veterinarians should apply careful professional judgement to case management so that needed care for animals continues to be provided while limiting staff and client person-to-person exposure and conserving PPE. This may also include prioritizing urgent patient visits and postponing non-urgent veterinary visits and elective procedures until regular business operations resume in your community. In some jurisdictions, executive orders will directly influence what types of procedures may be performed.\n\nThe greatest risk of COVID-19 exposure to staff at veterinary clinics comes from person-to-person transmission through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking, which is the main way SARS-CoV-2 spreads. Clinic staff should be screened daily, at the beginning of shifts prior to interacting with staff and clients, and should practice social distancing. Clinics should take precautions to minimize staff contact with all pet owners. Examples of actions to take to minimize contact with pet owners or other people include:\n\nUsing professional judgement when determining whether a case is urgent or non-urgentexternal icon and when procedures should be postponed.\nUsing telemedicine for consults or to help triage patients. Consult your state requirements for telemedicine and veterinary-client-patient relationship (VCPR) requirements.\nScheduling drop-off appointments or receiving companion animals from their owners\u2019 vehicles (also called curbside).\nCommunicating via telephone or video-chat to maintain social distancing.\nUsing direct-to-exam-room admissions or enforcing social distancing in the lobby.\nHaving staff members, rather than clients, hold animals to minimize direct contact.\nUsing online payment and billing to reduce handling credit cards or other potential fomites.\nHave a plan in place to handle animals with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 exposure, or potentially compatible clinical signs. Veterinarians should contact their state public health veterinarianpdf iconexternal icon or state animal health officialexternal icon for guidance on testing animals for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nScreen companion animals for exposure to people with COVID-19\nBefore scheduled appointments or upon arrival, a staff person should ask if the pet has had any exposure to a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.\n\nKnow actions to take if a pet owner has suspected or confirmed COVID-19\nIf a pet owner currently has respiratory symptoms or is suspected of or confirmed to have COVID-19, they should not visit the veterinary facility. Consider whether a telemedicine consult is appropriate. If possible, a healthy friend or family member from outside their household should bring the animal to the veterinary clinic. The clinic should use all appropriate precautions to minimize contact with the person bringing the animal to the clinic. If there is an emergency with the animal, the animal should not be denied care.\n\nIf a pet owner is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 and must bring their pet to the clinic, the following actions should be taken:\nCommunicate via phone call or video chat to maintain social distancing.\nRetrieve the animal from the owner\u2019s vehicle (also called curbside) to prevent the owner from having to enter the clinic or hospital.\nMaintain social distancing and PPE recommendations when interacting with clients.\nRequest smaller animals be brought in a plastic carrier to facilitate disinfection of the carrier after use. Also advise the owner to leave all non-essential items at home to avoid unnecessary opportunities for additional exposure.\nEvery effort should be made to prevent ill persons from entering the clinic, without negatively impacting animal welfare\nIf an ill pet owner must enter the clinic:\nHave the person wear a mask over his or her nose and mouth. Be prepared to provide a mask to the ill person if they do not have their own.\nDirect the pet owner and patient to a single exam room or isolation room.\nLimit the number of veterinary staff that enter the room, handle the animal, or interact with the pet owner and wear appropriate PPEpdf icon as described below.\nClean and disinfect the room, surfaces, supplies, floor, and equipment located within 6 feet of ill pet owners after they leave.\nIf you are a mobile or house call veterinarian and are called upon to evaluate a sick or injured companion animal in the home of a COVID-19 patient:\nEnter the home only if absolutely necessary. AVMAexternal icon suggests that mobile and house call veterinarians consider examining companion animals in their vehicle, outside, or seek the assistance of a local clinic. If you must enter the home where someone is sick with COVID-19, wear appropriate PPEpdf icon.\nPPE should be donned before entering the home and removed only after leaving the home, following appropriate donning and doffing procedurespdf icon.\nIf there is a sick person in the home, ask the sick person(s) to confine themselves to another room in the house if possible. If not possible, ask them to wear a mask and maintain a distance of at least 6 feet (2 meters). Be prepared to provide a mask to the ill person if they do not have their own. Minimize contact with other household members, even if they appear healthy, as person-to-person transmission can occur before symptom onset.\nWash hands immediatelypdf icon after removing PPE, handling the animal, or interacting with a sick person or household contact. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.\nCritical workers, like veterinarians and their staff, can be permitted to continue to work following a potential exposure to COVID-19, provided they remain asymptomatic and additional precautions are implemented to protect them and the workplace.\nClinical signs in animals\nThe clinical spectrum of illness for the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains largely undefined in animals. Companion animals may present with respiratory or gastrointestinal clinical signs based on the presentation of other coronaviruses more commonly found in animals as well as other emerging coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1 infection.\n\nClinical signs more likely to be compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection in mammalian animals may include a combination of the following:\n\nFever\nCoughing\nDifficulty breathing or shortness of breath\nLethargy\nSneezing\nNasal discharge\nOcular discharge\nVomiting\nDiarrhea\nPersonal protective equipment (PPE)\nGiven current limitations in knowledge regarding COVID-19 and companion animals, these PPE guidelines use a cautious approach. Recommendations may change over time, as new information becomes available. Veterinarians should use their professional judgement regarding potential for exposure to COVID-19 and PPE resource constraints when determining the appropriate PPE precautions to apply.\n\nVeterinarians should be aware of the current shortage of PPE due to the high demand for PPE in human healthcare settings. Veterinarians should consider their current PPE supply and rate of PPE use and review Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of PPE. Consider using reusable PPE where possible.\nVeterinarians and their staff should review the concepts in the NASPHV Compendium of Veterinary Standard Precautions for Zoonotic Disease Prevention in Veterinary Personnelexternal icon. This document outlines routine infection prevention practices designed to minimize transmission of zoonotic pathogens from animals to veterinary personnel. These guidelines are applicable regardless of ongoing infectious disease outbreaks but are especially important during an outbreak of an emerging infectious disease such as COVID-19.\nAnimal History\tFacemask\tEye Protection (face shield, goggles)\tGloves\tProtective Outerwear (gown or coveralls3)\tN95 Respirator or Suitable Alternative4\nRecommended Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Based on Companion Animal History\nHealthy companion animal without exposure to a person with COVID-19 compatible symptoms1, 2\tN1\tN1\tN1\tN1\tN1\nCompanion animal with an illness that is not suspicious of SARS-CoV-2 infection5 AND without exposure to a person with COVID-19 compatible symptoms1, 2\tN1\tN1\tN1\tN1\tN1\nCompanion animal that is not suspicious of SARS-CoV-2 infection5  BUT has exposure to a person with COVID-19 compatible symptoms\tY\tN1\tY\tN1\tN1\nCompanion animal with an illness that is suspicious of SARS-CoV-2 infection5\tY\tY\tY\tY\tN7\nAerosol-generating procedure for any animal without an exposure to a person with COVID-19 compatible symptoms6\tY\tY\tY\tY\tN7\nAerosol-generating procedure for any animal with an exposure to a person with COVID-19 compatible symptoms6\tN\tY\tY\tY\tY\nAny procedure on an animal that is known to be currently infected with SARS-CoV-2 through detection by a validated RT-PCR assay\tN\tY\tY\tY\tY\nAny procedure where a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 will be present\tN\tY\tY\tY\tY\n1PPE Standard Precautions should be applied in any setting where veterinary care is delivered and if exposure to exudates, feces, saliva, or other animal fluids is possible.\n\n2A companion animal\u2019s exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 exposure in this context refers to the following conditions within the 14 days before the animal is presented for veterinary care:\n\nBeing within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) of a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 starting from 2 days before the person\u2019s illness onset (or, for asymptomatic human patients, 2 days before positive specimen collection) until the time the person is isolated.\nHaving direct contact with infectious secretions from a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 starting from 2 days before the person\u2019s illness onset (or, for asymptomatic human patients, 2 days before positive specimen collection) until the time the person is isolated.

Veterinarians are strongly encouraged to rule out other, more common causes of illness before considering SARS-CoV-2 testing, especially among companion animals without a COVID-19 exposure.\n\nAdditional guidance on determining when testing a companion animal for SARS-CoV-2 is recommended can be found here.\nTake a thorough history to assess for likely exposure or risk factors in the 2 weeks prior to symptom onset, such as whether the animal has been in contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19, a person with COVID-19 compatible symptoms, or had recent exposure to a known high-risk environment, such as a nursing home.\n\nVeterinarians who have evaluated a companion animal and determined that it is consistent with SARS-CoV-2 testing guidance should contact their state public health veterinarianpdf iconexternal icon (SPHV) or state animal health officialexternal icon to discuss testing options.\n\nWhat to do if a companion animal tests positive for SARS-CoV-2\nIf an animal test is presumptive positive, veterinarians should immediately contact their state public health veterinarian or state veterinarian regarding next steps, and the testing laboratory should contact USDA\u2019s National Veterinary Services Laboratories for guidance on forwarding samples for confirmatory testing. Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals must be reported by USDA to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).external icon\n\nAt this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. We are still learning about this virus, and it appears that in some rare situations, people can spread the virus to animals. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19.\n\nOptions for companion animals that test positive for SARS-CoV-2\nVeterinarians should assess whether pets infected with SARS-CoV-2 can be cared for at home.  Considerations for home isolation include whether:\n\nThe pet is stable enough to receive care at home.\nThe pet owner is able to safely provide care at home.\nThere is a separate room where the pet can continue to recover without sharing immediate space with other pets and people, including high-risk individuals.\nThe pet owner and other household members have access to gloves and mask and are capable of adhering to precautions recommended as part of home care (e.g., hand hygiene).\nThe pet owner or other person who will be the primary caretaker of the pet at home does not have conditions that would put them at increased risk of complications from COVID-19 infection.\nBased on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are older adults and people of any age with certain underlying conditions.\nHome isolation recommendations\n\nIf the pet can be isolated at home, advise the pet owner to do the following:\n\nHave the pet stay in a designated \u201csick room\u201d (such as a laundry room or extra bathroom) if possible, or otherwise be separated from people and other animals. This is similar to how a person with COVID-19 would separate from others in their household.\nLimit interaction with the isolated pet as much as possible, while still ensuring appropriate care is provided for the animal.\nIf possible, the pet should use a litterbox or bathroom that is separate from other animals.\nDogs in households with access to private areas for elimination (e.g., backyard) should not be taken on walks. When walks are unavoidable, they should be limited to bathroom breaks, and restricted to the immediate vicinity of the dog\u2019s home. Interaction with other people or animals should be avoided.\nCats should be kept inside in a designated area away from people and other animals. Do not allow cats positive for SARS-CoV-2 to roam outside.\nUse gloves when picking up feces (poop). Throw out gloves and place waste material or litterbox waste in a sealed bag before throwing it away in a trashcan lined with a trash bag. Always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds immediately after cleaning up after your pet.\nAt this time, there is no evidence that companion animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19, but there are other zoonotic diseases that can spread between animal and people, so it is always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before and after interacting with them. If a companion animal is under home isolation for suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2:\nProvide bedding, bowls or containers, treats, and toys that are separate from those used by other people or animals in the household.\nDisinfect bowls, toys, and other animal care items with an EPA-registered disinfectantexternal icon and rinse thoroughly with clean water afterwards.\nSoft items like towels, blankets, and other bedding, can be safely laundered and reused. Dirty laundry that has been in contact with an ill animal can be washed with other items.\nAvoid taking the pet to human healthcare facilities, schools, dog parks, parks, groomers, and pet daycares, pet stores, boarding facilities, or similar places until the animal is cleared to resume normal activities.\nIf direct contact with the ill animal cannot be avoided, out of an abundance of caution, follow similar recommended precautions as for humans caring for other infected humans at home.\nVeterinary clinic isolation recommendations:\n\nVeterinary clinics or hospitals caring for ill, test-positive companion animals should have:\n\nA room where SARS-CoV-2-positive companion animals can be isolated from the rest of the patient population.\nA planned route for moving the animal from the transport vehicle to an isolation space.\nWhere possible, only animals being evaluated and treated for SARS-CoV-2 should be housed in this isolation space.\nSpace for veterinary personnel to don and doff PPE prior to entering the room, and immediately upon exiting. Alcohol-based hand rub, or a sink with soap and water (preferred) should be easily accessible and used before donning and immediately after doffing PPE.\nAvailability of an adequate amount of appropriate PPE for the projected duration of hospitalization. Consider utilizing reusable PPE when available.\nVeterinarians and veterinary staff should follow appropriate PPE guidance when providing care to sick, test positive companion animals.\nPlans for limiting the number of veterinary clinic staff that have contact with the animal and maintaining a log of all personnel who have had contact with the animal for occupational health monitoring.\nAbility to clean and disinfect the area with EPA-registered disinfectantsexternal icon.\nProcedures to limit or prohibit visitors and additional clinic or hospital traffic in the area(s) where sick, test-positive household animals are being housed and treated.\nRepeat testing\nWhere deemed appropriate, repeat testing of pets for SARS-CoV-2 or additional testing (e.g., serology) should be conducted in coordination with a state public health veterinarian and/or state animal health official.\n\nWhen a pet can resume normal activities\nIf the companion animal is test-positive for SARS-CoV-2, monitoring, isolation, and movement restrictions can end if these conditions are met:\n\nThe animal has not shown clinical signs consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection for at least 72 hours without medical management;\nAND one of the following conditions:\nIt has been at least 14 days since their last positive test from a lab that uses a validated SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR diagnostic assay;\n\u200bOR\nAll sample types collected at follow-up are negative by a validated SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR diagnostic assay.\nEmployees at increased risk for severe illness or outcomes\nBased on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have certain underlying medical conditions might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Based on what we know at this time, pregnant people might be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant people. Additionally, there may be an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, among pregnant people with COVID-19. For people at increased risk for severe illness and pregnant veterinary staff, facilities may want to consider limiting exposure of these individuals to both pet owners with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and to sick animals with a history of exposure to a human COVID-19 case.\n\nWhat to tell pet owners during the COVID-19 outbreak Informing pet owners on what is known about companion animals and SARS-CoV-2 is important to help them stay safe and healthy around their pets.  Below are key messages to share with pet owners:\n\nAt this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited data available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19.\nWe are still learning about this virus, and it appears that in some situations, people can spread the virus to animals.\nIf you are sick with COVID-19 (either suspected or confirmed by a test), you should restrict contact with pets and other animals, just as you would with people.\nWhen possible, have another member of your household care for your pets while you are sick.\nAvoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, sharing food, or sleeping in the same bed.\nIf you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with them and wear a mask.\nUntil we know more about how this virus affects animals, treat pets as you would other family members to prevent them from getting infected.\nAlthough we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets. Do not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or any other products not approved for animal use.\nDo not let pets interact with people outside your household.\nWalk dogs on a leash at least 6 feet away from others.\nAvoid public places where large numbers of people gather.\nDo not put masks on pets. Covering a pet\u2019s face could harm them.\nKeep cats indoors when possible and do not let them roam freely outside.\nBecause all animals can carry germs that can make people sick, it\u2019s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals.\nWash your hands after handling animals, their food, waste, or supplies.\nPractice good pet hygiene and clean up after pets properly.\nVisit CDC\u2019s Healthy Pets, Healthy People website for more information on keeping animals and people safe and healthy.\nAt this time, routine testing of animals for this new coronavirus is not recommended.",

            "Text": "CDC suggests that all school reopening plans address adherence to behaviors that prevent the spread of COVID-19. When used consistently and correctly, along with important mitigation strategies, masks are important to help slow the spread of COVID-19. Other important mitigation strategies include social distancing, washing hands, and regular cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces in schools and buses. CDC provides considerations for wearing masks and recommends that people wear masks in public settings and when around people who live outside of their household. The use of masks is especially important when social distancing is difficult to maintain.\n\nMasks are recommended as a simple barrier to help prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air and onto other people when the person wearing the mask coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice. Masks are an example of source control. Several studies1-13 have documented asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission; meaning that people with COVID-19 who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) and those who are not yet showing symptoms (pre-symptomatic) can still transmit the virus to other people. Masks are meant to protect other people in case the wearer is unknowingly infected. Masks are not personal protective equipment, such as surgical masks or respirators. \n\nThe use of masks in educational settings may present challenges, particularly for younger students and students with special healthcare or educational needs. This document provides guidance to help school administrators decide how to best implement the wearing of masks \u2015 in their school settings and facilities, including but not limited to buses and other shared transportation. \n\nEducation and promotion of positive and supportive relationships should remain the primary focus of school administrators, teachers, and staff. This guidance provides K-12 school administrators with strategies to encourage students to wear masks, consistent with CDC guidance, while maintaining a positive learning environment. \n\nGeneral Considerations\nCOVID-19 can be spread to others even if you do not feel sick. A mask helps prevent a person who is sick from spreading the virus to others. Appropriate and consistent use of masks is most important when students, teachers, and staff are indoors and when social distancing of at least 6 feet is difficult to implement or maintain.\n\nMasks should not be placed on:\n\nChildren younger than 2 years old.\nAnyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious.\nAnyone who is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.\nAppropriate and consistent use of masks may be challenging for some students, teachers, and staff, including:\n\nYounger students, such as those in early elementary school.\nStudents, teachers, and staff with severe asthma or other breathing difficulties.\nStudents, teachers, and staff with special educational or healthcare needs, including intellectual and developmental disabilities, mental health conditions, and sensory concerns or tactile sensitivity.\nWhile masks are strongly encouraged to reduce the spread of COVID-19, CDC recognizes there are specific instances when wearing a mask may not be feasible. In these instances, parents, guardians, caregivers, teachers, and school administrators should consider adaptations and alternatives whenever possible. They may need to consult with healthcare providers for advice about wearing masks.\n\nConsider use of clear masks that cover the nose and wrap securely around the face by some teachers and staff. Clear masks should be determined not to cause any breathing difficulties or over heating for the wearer. Teachers and staff who may consider using clear masks include:\n\nThose who interact with students or staff who are deaf or hard of hearing, per the Individuals with Disabilities Education Actexternal icon\nTeachers of young students learning to read\nTeachers of students in English as a second language classes\nTeachers of students with disabilities\nClear masks are not face shields. CDC does not recommend use of face shields for normal everyday activities or as a substitute for masks because of a lack of evidence of their effectiveness for source control.\n\nUnintended Consequences\nStigma, discrimination, or bullying may arise due to wearing or not wearing a mask. Schools should have a plan to prevent and address harmful or inappropriate behavior.\nNot all families will agree with school policies about masks. Schools should have a plan to address challenges that may arise and refer parents, caregivers, and guardians to CDC\u2019s guidance on masks.\nPractical Recommendations\nInclude masks on school supply lists and provide masks as needed to students, teachers, staff, or visitors who do not have them available.\nInclude clear masks on school supply lists for teachers and staff who regularly interact with students who are deaf or hard of hearing, students learning to read, students with disabilities, and those who rely on lip reading as a part of learning, such as students who are English Language Learners.\nEnsure that students and staff are aware of the correct use of masks, including wearing masks over the nose and mouth and securely around the face.\nEnsure that students, teachers and staff are aware that they should wash or sanitize their hands (using a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol) before putting on a mask.\nEnsure that students, teachers, and staff are aware that they should not touch their masks while wearing them and, if they do, they should wash their hands before and after with soap and water or sanitize hands (using a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol).\nEnsure teachers and staff are aware that they should wash or sanitize hands (using a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol) before and after helping a student put on or adjust a mask.\nEnsure that all students and staff are aware that masks should not be worn if they are wet. A wet mask may make it difficult to breathe.\nEnsure that all students and staff are aware that they should never share or swap masks.\nStudents\u2019 masks should be clearly identified with their names or initials, to avoid confusion or swapping. Students\u2019 masks may also be labeled to indicate top/bottom and front/back.\nMasks should be stored in a space designated for each student that is separate from others when not being worn (e.g., in individually labeled containers or bags, personal lockers, or cubbies).\nMasks should be washed after every day of use and/or before being used again, or if visibly soiled.\nStudents and schools should consider having additional masks available for students, teachers, and staff in case a back-up mask is needed during the day and to facilitate every day washing of masks.\nAdditional Considerations for the Use of Masks among K-12 Students\nCDC recommends that people, including teachers, staff, and students, wear masks in public settings as able when around people who live outside of their household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.\n\nThe following table contains examples of some, but not all, situations schools might encounter.\n\nMasks in schoolspdf icon\n\nAdditional Considerations for the Use of Masks among K-12 Students\nPossible Student Scenario\tMasks recommended\tMasks may be considered\tAdditional considerations\nStudents are seated less than 6 feet apart while riding a bus or carpooling\tcheck solid icon\t\t\nMasks should always be worn by bus and carpool drivers as able*\nStudents are less than 6 feet apart while entering or exiting school (e.g., carpool drop off/pick up) or while transitioning to/from other activities\tcheck solid icon\t\t\nConsider having staff monitor students during transitions to encourage correct use and distribute masks as needed.\nTeachers and staff should wash or sanitize hands (using a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol) before and after helping a student put on or adjust a mask.\nStudents are seated at least 6 feet apart in the classroom\t\tcheck solid icon\t\nAdaptations and alternatives should be considered whenever possible to increase the feasibility of wearing a mask or to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading.\nStudents are seated less than 6 feet apart in the classroom, or are engaging in learning stations or circle time that require close contact\tcheck solid icon\t\t\nSchools may consider keeping students in \u201ccohorts.\u201d Cohorts are groups of students that do not mix with other cohorts/groups of students throughout the school day.\nAdaptations and alternatives should be considered whenever possible to increase the feasibility of wearing a mask or to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading.\nStudents are less than 6 feet apart while transitioning between classes or to other activities during the school day\tcheck solid icon\t\t\nSchools may consider staggering classroom transition times and allow only one-way pathways/hallways.\nAdaptations and alternatives should be considered whenever possible to increase the feasibility of wearing a mask or to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading.\nStudents are at recess or in physical education class.\t\tcheck solid icon\t\nVigorous exercise in a confined space (e.g., indoors) may contribute to transmission of COVID-19 and should be limited.\nSocial distancing helps protect students at recess or in physical education class.\nConsider conducting activities in an area with greater ventilation or air exchange (e.g., outdoors).\nSee CDC\u2019s guidance on youth sports for more information.\nAdaptations and alternatives should be considered whenever possible to increase the feasibility of wearing a mask or to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading.\nStudents are in band, choir, or music class.\t\tcheck solid icon\t\nWhen students are not singing or playing an instrument that requires the use of their mouth, they should wear a mask in music class (unless class is outdoors and distance can be maintained).\nSocial distancing helps protect students in music class.\nWhile students are singing or playing an instrument, use visual cues to keep them at least 6 feet apart.

If parents, caregivers, and guardians model appropriate use of masks and help students get used to wearing them, students may be more comfortable using them.\nIntroduce students with sensory concerns/tactile sensitivities to masks with a variety of materials, prints, and textures, and allow them to choose which mask is most comfortable.\nUse behavioral techniques such as positive reinforcement to increase the likelihood that students will comply with mask guidance and other prevention practices.\nEncourage parents, caregivers, and guardians to include students in the selection of their mask and/or the material that is used to make it. This might increase a child\u2019s acceptance of wearing the mask.\nDisplay age appropriate posters and materials with visual cues that show the proper way to wear a mask in classrooms and hallways. Consider incorporating images of popular influencers promoting or modeling use of masks.\nInclude reminders about masks in daily announcements, school newspapers, and other materials.  All communication should be in an appropriate format, literacy level, and language. Consider including how to properly use, take off, and wash masks in back-to-school communications educational materials. \nElementary School Settings\nEnsure that teachers and school staff are available to help students put on and adjust masks as needed and that teachers and staff wash or sanitize their hands with hand sanitizer that includes at least 60% alcohol before and after doing so.\nPlay games or engage in other fun activities that teach students how to wear a mask.\nConsider using some art materials or other creative outlets to help students understand why masks help reduce the spread of COVID-19.\nShare social stories about masks with students so they know what to expect at school. A social story is similar to a simple picture book that teaches students what to expect in social settings.\nUse behavioral techniques, such as positive reinforcement, to increase the likelihood that students will comply with mask guidance. \nMiddle School Settings\nShow short videos or incorporate short lessons (less than 10 minutes) that teach students how to wear a mask. Consider including videos with celebrities, musicians, athletes or other influencers popular among this age group.\nFollow videos with verbal instructions that demonstrate the correct ways to wear a mask.\nEngage the class in discussions about why masks help reduce the spread of COVID-19.\nIncorporate a lesson into the science curriculum on how respiratory droplets spread infectious disease.\nCreate a school competition for the best health communication strategy to highlight the importance of wearing a mask to middle school students.\nHigh School Settings\nShow videos or incorporate lessons that teach students how to wear a mask, including the correct and incorrect ways to wear a mask. Consider including videos with celebrities, musicians, athletes, or other influencers popular among this age group.\nAsk students to write a short paper on the science behind the use of masks as a form of source control.\nCreate a school competition for the best health communication strategy to highlight the importance of wearing masks to high school students.\nStudents with Special Healthcare Needs\nAsk parents, caregivers, and guardians to practice wearing masks at home before the student returns to school.\nShare social stories about masks with students so they know what to expect at school. A social story is similar to a simple picture book that teaches students about what to expect in social settings.\nIntroduce students with sensory concerns or tactile sensitivities to masks with a variety of materials, prints, and textures, and allow them to choose which mask is most comfortable.\nUse behavioral techniques such as positive reinforcement to increase the likelihood that students will comply with mask guidance and other prevention practices.",

            "HeadLine": "Criteria for Return to Work for Healthcare Personnel with SARS-CoV-2 Infection (Interim Guidance)",
            "Text": "Who this is for: Occupational health programs and public health officials making decisions about return to work for healthcare personnel (HCP) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, or who have suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g., developed symptoms of COVID-19) but were never tested for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nHCP with symptoms of COVID-19 should be prioritized for viral testing with approved nucleic acid or antigen detection assays.  When a clinician decides that testing a person for SARS-CoV-2 is indicated, negative results from at least one FDA Emergency Use Authorized COVID-19 molecular viral assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA indicates that the person most likely does not have an active SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time the sample was collected. A second test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be performed at the discretion of the evaluating healthcare provider, particularly when a higher level of clinical suspicion for SARS-CoV-2 infection exists.  For HCP who were suspected of having COVID-19 and had it ruled out, either with at least one negative test or a clinical decision that COVID-19 is not suspected and testing is not indicated, then return to work decisions should be based on their other suspected or confirmed diagnoses.\n\nDecisions about return to work for HCP with SARS-CoV-2 infection should be made in the context of local circumstances. In general, a symptom-based strategy should be used as described below.  The time period used depends on the HCP\u2019s severity of illness and if they are severely immunocompromised.1\n\nA test-based strategy is no longer recommended (except as noted below) because, in the majority of cases, it results in excluding from work HCP who continue to shed detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA but are no longer infectious.\n\nOther Resources:\n\nFor guidance about assessment of risk and application of work restrictions for asymptomatic HCP with potential exposure to patients, visitors, or other HCP with confirmed COVID-19, refer to the Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Work Restrictions for Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure to COVID-19.\n\nReturn to Work Criteria for HCP with SARS-CoV-2 Infection\nSymptom-based strategy for determining when HCP can return to work.\n\nHCP with mild to moderate illness who are not severely immunocompromised:\n\nAt least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared and\nAt least 24 hours have passed since last fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and\nSymptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) have improved\nNote:  HCP who are not severely immunocompromised and were asymptomatic throughout their infection may return to work when at least 10 days have passed since the date of their first positive viral diagnostic test.\n\nHCP with severe to critical illness or who are severely immunocompromised1:\n\nAt least 10 days and up to 20 days have passed since symptoms first appeared\nAt least 24 hours have passed since last fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and\nSymptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath) have improved\nConsider consultation with infection control experts\nNote:  HCP who are severely immunocompromised but who were asymptomatic throughout their infection may return to work when at least 10 days and up to 20 days have passed since the date of their first positive viral diagnostic test.\n\nAs described in the Decision Memo, an estimated 95% of severely or critically ill patients, including some with severe immunocompromise, no longer had replication-competent virus 15 days after onset of symptoms; no patient had replication-competent virus more than 20 days after onset of symptoms. The exact criteria that determine which HCP will shed replication-competent virus for longer periods are not known. Disease severity factors and the presence of immunocompromising conditions should be considered in determining the appropriate duration for specific HCP. For example, HCP with characteristics of severe illness may be most appropriately managed with at least 15 days before return to work.\n\nTest-Based Strategy for Determining when HCP Can Return to Work.\n\nIn some instances, a test-based strategy could be considered to allow HCP to return to work earlier than if the symptom-based strategy were used. However, as described in the Decision Memo, many individuals will have prolonged viral shedding, limiting the utility of this approach. A test-based strategy could also be considered for some HCP (e.g., those who are severely immunocompromised1) in consultation with local infectious diseases experts if concerns exist for the HCP being infectious for more than 20 days.\n\nThe criteria for the test-based strategy are:\n\nHCP who are symptomatic:\n\nResolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and\nImprovement in symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath), and\nResults are negative from at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected \u226524 hours apart (total of two negative specimens) tested using an FDA-authorized molecular viral assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. See Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\nHCP who are not symptomatic:\n\nResults are negative from at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected \u226524 hours apart (total of two negative specimens) tested using an FDA-authorized molecular viral assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. See Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Return to Work Practices and Work Restrictions\nAfter returning to work, HCP should:\n\nWear a facemask for source control at all times while in the healthcare facility until all symptoms are completely resolved or at baseline. A facemask instead of a cloth face covering should be used by these HCP for source control during this time period while in the facility. After this time period, these HCP should revert to their facility policy regarding universal source control during the pandemic.\nA facemask for source control does not replace the need to wear an N95 or equivalent or higher-level respirator (or other recommended PPE) when indicated, including when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nSelf-monitor for symptoms, and seek re-evaluation from occupational health if symptoms recur or worsen. Strategies to Mitigate Healthcare Personnel Staffing Shortages\nMaintaining appropriate staffing in healthcare facilities is essential to providing a safe work environment for HCP and safe patient care. As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, staffing shortages will likely occur due to HCP exposures, illness, or need to care for family members at home. Healthcare facilities must be prepared for potential staffing shortages and have plans and processes in place to mitigate them, including considerations for permitting HCP to return to work without meeting all return to work criteria above. Refer to the Strategies to Mitigate Healthcare Personnel Staffing Shortages document for information. Definitions\nCloth face covering: Textile (cloth) covers are intended to keep the person wearing one from spreading respiratory secretions when talking, sneezing, or coughing. They are not PPE, and it is uncertain whether cloth face coverings protect the wearer. CDC has guidance available on design, use, and maintenance of cloth face coverings.\n\nFacemask: Facemasks are PPE and are often referred to as surgical masks or procedure masks. Use facemasks according to product labeling and local, state, and federal requirements. FDA-cleared surgical masks are designed to protect against splashes and sprays and are prioritized for use when such exposures are anticipated, including surgical procedures. Facemasks that are not regulated by FDA, such as some procedure masks, which are typically used for isolation purposes, may not provide protection against splashes and sprays.\n\nRespirator: A respirator is a personal protective device that is worn on the face, covers at least the nose and mouth, and is used to reduce the wearer\u2019s risk of inhaling hazardous airborne particles (including dust particles and infectious agents), gases, or vapors. Respirators are certified by the CDC/NIOSH, including those intended for use in healthcare.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 Illness Severity Criteria (adapted from the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelinesexternal icon):\n\nNote:  The studies used to inform this guidance did not clearly define \u201csevere\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d illness. This guidance has taken a conservative approach to define these categories. Although not developed to inform decisions about when HCP with SARS-CoV-2 infection may return to work, the definitions in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelinesexternal icon are one option for defining severity of illness categories. The highest level of illness severity experienced by the HCP at any point in their clinical course should be used when determining when they may return to work.\n\nMild Illness: Individuals who have any of the various signs and symptoms of COVID 19 (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, headache, muscle pain) without shortness of breath, dyspnea, or abnormal chest imaging.\n\nModerate Illness: Individuals who have evidence of lower respiratory disease by clinical assessment or imaging and a saturation of oxygen (SpO2) \u226594% on room air at sea level.\n\nSevere Illness: Individuals who have respiratory frequency >30 breaths per minute, SpO2 <94% on room air at sea level (or, for patients with chronic hypoxemia, a decrease from baseline of >3%), ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) <300 mmHg, or lung infiltrates >50%.\n\nCritical Illness: Individuals who have respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction.Footnotes\n1The studies used to inform this guidance did not clearly define \u201cseverely immunocompromised\u201d. For the purposes of this guidance, CDC used the following definition that was created to more generally address HCP occupational exposures.\n\nSome conditions, such as being on chemotherapy for cancer, being within one year out from receiving a hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplant, untreated HIV infection with CD4 T lymphocyte count < 200, combined primary immunodeficiency disorder, and receipt of prednisone >20mg/day for more than 14 days, may cause a higher degree of immunocompromise and require actions such as lengthening the duration of HCP work restrictions.\nOther factors, such as advanced age, diabetes mellitus, or end-stage renal disease, may pose a much lower degree of immunocompromise and not clearly affect occupational health actions to prevent disease transmission.\nUltimately, the degree of immunocompromise for HCP is determined by the treating provider, and preventive actions are tailored to each individual and situation.",

            "Text": "People who are homeless are at risk of COVID-19.\n\nHomeless services are often provided in congregate settings, which could facilitate the spread of infection. Because many people who are homeless are older adults or have underlying medical conditions, they may also be at increased risk for severe illness.\n\nHealth departments and healthcare facilities should be aware that people who are homeless are a particularly vulnerable group. If possible, identifying non-congregate settings where those at increased risk can stay may help protect them from COVID-19.\n\nHow people experiencing homelessness can protect themselves\nMany of the recommendations to prevent COVID-19 may be difficult for a person experiencing homelessness to do. Although it may not be possible to avoid certain crowded locations (such as shelters), people who are homeless should:\n\nTry to avoid other crowded public settings.\nIf using public transportation, follow the CDC guidance on how to protect yourself when using transportation, try to travel during less busy times, and clean your hands as soon as possible after their trip.\nIf possible, use take-away options for food.\nMaintain a distance of 6 feet (about two arms\u2019 length) from other people.\nWash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds as often as possible, and cover their coughs and sneezes.\nIf people experiencing homelessness have symptoms\nAny person experiencing homelessness with symptoms consistent with COVID-19  (fever, cough, or shortness of breath) should alert their service providers (such as case managers, shelter staff, and other care providers). These staff will help the individual understand how to isolate themselves and identify options for medical care as needed.\n\nHow to get tested for COVID-19\nIf they meet criteria for testing, people experiencing homelessness will access COVID-19 testing through a healthcare provider.\n\nLocal public health and healthcare facilities need to determine the best location for this testing in coordination with homeless healthcare clinics and street medicine clinics.\n\nAnyone sick with COVID-19 should stay isolated\nThose with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should stay in a place where they can best be isolated from other people to prevent spreading the infection. Local health departments, housing authorities, homeless service systems, and healthcare facilities should plan to identify locations to isolate those with known or suspected COVID-19 until they meet the criteria to end isolation.\n\nIsolation housing could be units designated by local authorities or shelters determined to have capacity to sufficiently isolate these people. If no other options are available, homeless service providers should plan for how they can help people isolate themselves while efforts are underway to provide additional support.\n\nDonations of food and clothing to homeless service providers\nHomeless service providers can accept donations of food and clothing during community spread of COVID-19, but general infection control precautions should be taken. Request that donors not donate if they are sick.\n\nSet up donation drop-off points to encourage social distancing between shelter workers and those donating.\nLaunder donated clothing, sheets, towels, or other fabrics on high heat settings, and disinfect items that are nonporous, such as items made of plastic.\nFood donations should be shelf-stable, and shelter staff should take usual food-related infection prevention precautionsexternal icon.\nSymptom screening of clients at homeless shelters\nHomeless shelters can screen clients for symptoms of respiratory infections.\n\nClients who have symptoms may or may not have COVID-19. Make sure they have a separate place they can safely stay within the shelter or at an alternate site in coordination with local health authorities.  An on-site nurse or other clinical staff can help with clinical assessments.\n\nProvide anyone who presents with symptoms with a mask.\nFacilitate access to non-urgent medical care as needed.\nUse standard facility procedures to determine whether a client needs immediate medical attention. Emergency signs include:\nTrouble breathing\nPersistent pain or pressure in the chest\nNew confusion or inability to arouse\nBluish lips or face\nNotify the designated medical facility and personnel to transfer clients that the client might have COVID-19.\n\nKeeping open homeless shelters and encampments\nHomeless shelters serve a critical function in our communities. Shelters should stay open unless homeless service providers, health departments, and housing authorities have determined together that a shelter needs to close.\n\nConnecting people to stable housing should continue to be a priority.\n\nHowever, if individual housing options are not available, allow people who are living in encampments to remain where they are.\nEncourage people living in encampments to increase space between people and provide hygiene resources.",

For some other illnesses caused by respiratory viruses (such as influenza), some people may be more likely to have severe illness than others because they have characteristics or medical conditions that increase their risk. These are commonly called \u201crisk factors.\u201d  Examples include older age or having certain underlying medical conditions.\n\nCDC is conducting disease surveillance and field investigations to better understand why some people are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 illness. This is one of the top priorities in CDC\u2019s strategy to combat COVID-19. What we learn from these efforts will provide vital information to help CDC scientists and other public health officials make decisions to protect our most vulnerable populations.\n\nCDC carries out these activities in collaboration with state, local, and territorial health departments; public health, commercial, and clinical laboratories; vital statistics offices; health care providers; emergency departments; and academic and private sector partners.\n\nWhy Risk Factors Matter\nPeople with risk factors may be more likely to need hospitalization or intensive care if they have COVID-19, or they may be more likely to die of the infection.\n\nIt is important to learn about risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness because it can help you:\n\nTake precautions as you go about your daily life and attend events.\nBetter understand how a medical condition could affect your own health if you get sick with COVID-19.\nAnticipate medical treatment that you might need if you get sick.\nReduce your risk for severe COVID-19 illness by managing any conditions you have that are risk factors.\nHow We Learn about Risk Factors for Severe Disease\nBecause COVID-19 is a new disease, more work is needed to better understand the risk factors for severe illness or complications. Potential risk factors that have been identified to date include:\n\nAge\nRace/ethnicity\nGender\nSome medical conditions\nUse of certain medications\nPoverty and crowding\nCertain occupations\nPregnancy\nAdditional research will help us confirm if these are risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness and determine if there are other factors that increase a person\u2019s risk.\n\nInvestigations\nCDC is working to identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness through a variety of investigations, some of which are described below.  These investigations include adults and children and examine severe illness resulting in hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As we continue to investigate risk factors for severe illness, we will update this webpage with new findings and new investigations.\n\nInvestigation of People with COVID-19 Who Have Symptoms (Symptomatic) vs. People with COVID-19 Who Do Not Have Symptoms (Asymptomatic or Pre-symptomatic)*\nclipboard check light icon\nAssessment\nCompare characteristics of people with COVID-19 who have symptoms with characteristics of people with COVID-19 who do not have symptoms.\n\nbook reader light icon\nWhat We Will Learn\nHow people with COVID-19 who have symptoms are different from those with COVID-19 who do not have symptoms.\n\nHow people with COVID-19 who feel more sick (for example, sick enough to need to stay in bed or to seek medical care) are different from those with COVID-19 who feel less sick.

            "Text": "CDC recommends that people wear masks in public settings and when around people who don\u2019t live in your household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.\nMasks may help prevent people who have COVID-19 from spreading the virus to others.\nMasks are most likely to reduce the spread of COVID-19 when they are widely used by people in public settings.\nMasks should NOT be worn by children under the age of 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.\nMasks with exhalation valves or vents should NOT be worn to help prevent the person wearing the mask from spreading COVID-19 to others (source control).\nEvidence for Effectiveness of Masks Masks are recommended as a simple barrier to help prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air and onto other people when the person wearing the mask coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice. This is called source control. This recommendation is based on what we know about the role respiratory droplets play in the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, paired with emerging evidence from clinical and laboratory studies that shows masks reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth. COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet), so the use of masks is particularly important in settings where people are close to each other or where social distancing is difficult to maintain. CDC\u2019s recommendations for masks will be updated as new scientific evidence becomes available.\n\nWho Should Wear A Mask?\n General public\n\nCDC recommends all people 2 years of age and older wear a mask in public settings and when around people who don\u2019t live in your household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.\nCOVID-19 can be spread by people who do not have symptoms and do not know that they are infected. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important for everyone to wear masks in public settings and practice social distancing (staying at least 6 feet away from other people).\nWhile masks are strongly encouraged to reduce the spread of COVID-19, CDC recognizes there are specific instances when wearing a mask may not be feasible. In these instances, adaptations and alternatives should be considered whenever possible (see below for examples).\n People who know or think they might have COVID-19\nIf you are sick with COVID-19 or think you might have COVID-19, do not visit public areas. Stay home except to get medical care. As much as possible stay in a specific room and away from other people and pets in your home. If you need to be around other people or animals, wear a mask (including in your home).\nThe mask helps prevent a person who is sick from spreading the virus to others. It helps keep respiratory droplets contained and from reaching other people.\nCaregivers of people with COVID-19\nThose caring for someone who is sick with COVID-19 at home or in a non-healthcare setting may also wear a mask. However, the protective effects\u2014how well the mask protects healthy people from breathing in the virus\u2014are unknown. To prevent getting sick, caregivers should also continue to practice everyday preventive actions: avoid close contact as much as possible, clean hands often; avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands; and frequently clean and disinfect surfaces.\nWho Should Not Wear a Mask\nMasks should not be worn by:\n\nChildren younger than 2 years old\nAnyone who has trouble breathing\nAnyone who is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance\nFeasibility and Adaptations\nCDC recognizes that wearing masks may not be possible in every situation or for some people. In some situations, wearing a mask may exacerbate a physical or mental health condition, lead to a medical emergency, or introduce significant safety concerns. Adaptations and alternatives should be considered whenever possible to increase the feasibility of wearing a mask or to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading if it is not possible to wear one.\n\nFor example,\n\nPeople who are deaf or hard of hearing\u2014or those who care for or interact with a person who is hearing impaired\u2014may be unable to wear masks if they rely on lipreading to communicate. In this situation, consider using a clear mask. If a clear mask isn\u2019t available, consider whether you can use written communication, use closed captioning, or decrease background noise to make communication possible while wearing a mask that blocks your lips.\nSome people, such as people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, mental health conditions or other sensory sensitivities, may have challenges wearing a mask. They should consult with their healthcare provider for advice about wearing masks.\nYounger children (e.g., preschool or early elementary aged) may be unable to wear a mask properly, particularly for an extended period of time. Wearing of masks may be prioritized at times when it is difficult to maintain a distance of 6 feet from others (e.g., during carpool drop off or pick up, or when standing in line at school). Ensuring proper mask size and fit and providing children with frequent reminders and education on the importance and proper wear of masks may help address these issues.\nPeople should not wear masks while engaged in activities that may cause the mask to become wet, like when swimming at the beach or pool. A wet mask may make it difficult to breathe. For activities like swimming, it is particularly important to maintain physical distance from others when in the water.\nPeople who are engaged in high intensity activities, like running, may not be able to wear a mask if it causes difficulty breathing. If unable to wear a mask, consider conducting the activity in a location with greater ventilation and air exchange (for instance, outdoors versus indoors) and where it is possible to maintain physical distance from others.\nPeople who work in a setting where masks may increase the risk of heat-related illness or cause safety concerns due to introduction of a hazard (for instance, straps getting caught in machinery) may consult with an occupational safety and health professional to determine the appropriate mask for their setting. Outdoor workers may prioritize use of masks when in close contact with other people, like during group travel or shift meetings, and remove masks when social distancing is possible. Find more information here and below.\nMasks are a critical preventive measure and are most essential in times when social distancing is difficult. If masks cannot be used, make sure to take other measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread, including social distancing, frequent hand washing, and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces.\n\nMasks with Exhalation Valves or Vents\nThe purpose of masks is to keep respiratory droplets from reaching others to aid with source control. However, masks with one-way valves or vents allow air to be exhaled through a hole in the material, which can result in expelled respiratory droplets that can reach others.  This type of mask does not prevent the person wearing the mask from transmitting COVID-19 to others. Therefore, CDC does not recommend using masks for source control if they have an exhalation valve or vent.\n\nFace Shields\nA face shield is primarily used for eye protection for the person wearing it. At this time, it is not known what level of protection a face shield provides to people nearby from the spray of respiratory droplets from the wearer. There is currently not enough evidence to support the effectiveness of face shields for source control. Therefore, CDC does not currently recommend use of face shields as a substitute for masks.\nHowever, wearing a mask may not be feasible in every situation for some people for example, people who are deaf or hard of hearing\u2014or those who care for or interact with a person who is hearing impaired. Here are some considerations for individuals who must wear a face shield instead of a mask:\nAlthough evidence on face shields is limited, the available data suggest that the following face shields may provide better source control than others:\nFace shields that wrap around the sides of the wearer\u2019s face and extend below the chin.\nHooded face shields.\nFace shield wearers should wash their hands before and after removing the face shield and avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth when removing it.\nDisposable face shields should only be worn for a single use and disposed of according to manufacturer instructions.\nReusable face shields should be cleaned and disinfected after each use according to manufacturer instructions or by following CDC face shield cleaning instructions .\nPlastic face shields for newborns and infants are NOT recommended.\nSurgical Masks\nMasks are not surgical masks or respirators. Currently, those are critical supplies that should continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance. Masks also are not appropriate substitutes for them in workplaces where surgical masks or respirators are recommended or required and available.",

Testing for all three viruses at the same time will provide public health officials with information they need to help reduce the spread of these viruses in the community while conserving resources that are in short supply.\n\nCDC Influenza SARS-CoV-2 Multiplex Assay\nCDC\u2019s newest laboratory test, detects two types of influenza viruses (A and B) and SARS-CoV-2 at the same time. This test is called the CDC Influenza SARS-CoV-2 (Flu SC2) Multiplex Assay.\n\nA single test that diagnoses current infection with one or more of these viruses will allow public health laboratories to continue influenza surveillance while they are also testing for SARS-CoV-2. Information about both viruses will help public health officials to control the spread of influenza and COVID-19 in the community and may help health care providers manage treatment of influenza and COVID-19. The test will also allow laboratories to conserve important testing materials that are in short supply and process up to three times as many tests as they can with the existing test for SARS CoV-2.\n\nThe Flu SC2 test kit was evaluated in CDC laboratories and three other public health laboratories to ensure that the test works as intended. The Flu SC2 Multiplex Assay was designed using data about SARS-CoV-2 genomes that were not available when the earlier test was designed, which is likely to improve performance of the test.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorizationexternal icon (EUA) for use of the Flu SC2 Multiplex Assay on July 2, 2020. The EUA processexternal icon enables FDA to consider and authorize the use of unapproved but potentially lifesaving medical or diagnostic products during a public health emergency. The U.S Secretary of Health and Human Services declared SARS-CoV-2 to be a U.S. public health emergency on January 31, 2020. CDC 2019-nCoV RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel In early 2020, CDC developed its first laboratory test kit for use in testing patient specimens for SARS-CoV-2. The test kit is called the CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)\u2013PCR Diagnostic Panel.\n\nOn February 3, 2020, CDC submitted an EUA package to expedite FDA-permitted use of the CDC diagnostic panel in the United States. FDA issued the EUA the next day, and CDC sent the test kits to state and local public health laboratories.\n\nBefore laboratories use a new test on samples from patients, they must verify the test performance (make sure it works as expected) using \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d control materials. The positive control should always test positive, and the negative control should always test negative. During validation of the CDC SARS-CoV-2 test, some laboratories discovered a problem with one of the test\u2019s three reagents\u2014chemicals required to run a test. The reagent produced a positive result with the negative control, so laboratories could not verify test performance.\n\nTo resolve the issue, CDC laboratories determined that this reagent could be left out without affecting test accuracy because of the built-in redundancy in test design. The redundant design saved time by allowing the kits to be used without the reagent. FDA authorized this modification, and new test kits with the two necessary reagents were manufactured and distributed to states. These kits are still in use.\n\nHigh demand for the reagents needed with this test has resulted in global shortages. Some public health laboratories have been unable to get testing reagents to support their testing volumes, resulting in testing delays. Therefore, CDC laboratories validated alternatives for processing the testexternal icon:\n\nFour additional extraction reagents that can be used in the existing extraction methods\nAn additional extraction instrument and associated reagents\nA new process that can be used in place of the extraction method when materials for the current method are limited\nFDA approved these changes on June 12, 2020, in an amendmentexternal icon to the test\u2019s EUA to allow state public health laboratories and others to use these alternatives. Additionally, FDA approved an amendmentexternal icon on July 13, 2020, to add the Promega Maxwell\u00ae RSC 48 as an authorized extraction instrument for use with the CDC 2019-nCoV rRT-PCR Diagnostic Panel.\n\nWho Can Use These Tests?\nCDC tests are provided to U.S. state and local public health laboratories and Department of Defense laboratories that were either previously qualified for being able to perform a similar type of test used to detect influenza or have been recently approved by their state public health laboratory for SARS-CoV-2 testing.",

            "HeadLine": "Coronavirus in South Africa: Scientists explore surprise theory for low death rate",
            "Text": "Infection and death rates in many African countries have turned out to be much lower than initially feared. As the number of infections dips sharply in South Africa, experts there are exploring a startling hypothesis, as our Africa correspondent Andrew Harding reports from Johannesburg.\nCrowded townships. Communal washing spaces. The impossibility of social distancing in communities where large families often share a single room...\nFor months health experts and politicians have been warning that living conditions in crowded urban communities in South Africa and beyond are likely to contribute to a rapid spread of the coronavirus.\n\"Population density is such a key factor. If you don't have the ability to social distance, the virus spreads,\" said Professor Salim Karim, the head of South Africa's ministerial advisory team on Covid-19.\nBut some experts are now posing the question, what if the opposite is also true? What if those same crowded conditions also offer a possible solution to the mystery that has been unresolved for months? What if those conditions - they are asking - could prove to give people in South Africa, and in similar settings globally, some extra protection against Covid-19? \"It seems possible that our struggles, our poor conditions might be working in favour of African countries and our populations,\" said Professor Shabir Madhi, South Africa's top virologist and an important figure in the hunt for a vaccine for Covid-19.\nIn the early stages of the pandemic, experts across Africa - echoed by many leaders - appeared to agree that the continent faced a severe threat from the virus.\n\"I thought we were heading towards a disaster, a complete meltdown,\" said Professor Shabir Madhi.\nEven the most optimistic modelling and predictions showed, for example, that South Africa's hospitals - and the continent's most developed health system - would be quickly overwhelmed. And yet, today South Africa is emerging from its first wave of infections with a Covid-19 death rate roughly seven times lower than Britain's.\nScientists acknowledge that reliable data is not always easy to come by and all these figures are likely to change. But even if deaths have been under-reported here - perhaps by a factor of two - South Africa has still performed impressively well, as have many other parts of the continent, where many hospital beds remain empty, and where infection graphs have almost entirely avoided the pronounced peaks and sharp angles seen in so many other parts of the world. \"Most African countries don't have a peak. I don't understand why. I'm completely at sea,\" admitted Professor Salim Karim - widely seen as a leading voice on the pandemic response in South Africa and across the continent.\n\"This is an enigma. It's completely unbelievable,\" said Professor Shabir Madhi. For a while now, experts have cited a youthful population as the best explanation for Africa's relatively low infection rates. After all, the average age on the continent is roughly half that in Europe. Far fewer Africans live into their 80s, and so are less likely to succumb to the virus as a result.\n\"Age is the highest risk factor. Africa's young population protects it,\" said Tim Bromfield, a regional director of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change.\nBut as the pandemic drags on, and the statistical evidence builds up, analysts appear increasingly reluctant to give demographics all the credit for this continent's successes.\n\"Age is not such a big factor,\" said Professor Karim.\nEarly, and aggressive lockdowns here in South Africa and elsewhere on the continent have clearly played a crucial role. Clear messaging about masks and the provision of oxygen supplies have also been important.",

She said: \"The main thrust of the study is to understand the rates of infections and to jump on them very quickly, so we're giving heads the tools to spot infections early and to keep their schools open, and so permit the continuity of education.\" Schools and the NHS Test and Trace system will receive the data to help map infections in the city.\n\nResearchers will also work with schools, looking at attendance data, seating plans and timetables to help them put appropriate measures in place.\n\nSt Mary Redcliffe and Temple School in Bristol, where all pupils returned last week, is one of the first schools to become involved in the study.\n\nPupil volunteers\nRipley, in Year 10, is just starting her GCSEs and will be volunteering for a test.\n\n\"I want to take part in it because I think it would be really useful to get tested even if you don't have any of the symptoms, to be extra sure,\" she said.\n\nReuben, in Year 8, thinks pupils might be surprised by a positive test but it would be useful to know.\n\n\"The benefits are you know you can take precautions. You can quickly isolate and help others stay safe and keep yourself safe.\"\n\nElijah, in Year 11, will take his GCSEs next summer and is keen that his year group faces the least possible disruption to their learning.\n\n\"We've had quite lot of months off school so keeping school open for our year right now is probably the best thing that can happen, so it will just mean a lot to everybody,\" he said.\n\nHead teacher Elisabeth Gilpin said: \"We were able to work with the scientists, to say: 'What do head teachers need to be able to keep their schools safe and to keep them open and to minimise the chance of closing?'\n\n\"So for us to get testing of a large percentage of the school population, even the asymptomatic people is just so exciting.\" Staff have also welcomed being part of the study.\n\nJean Miller, a receptionist at the school, is keen to take part: \"I've got grandchildren and I had glandular fever twice so my immune system isn't quite what it was and to know we have got the testing and we're as safe as we can possibly be is massively reassuring.\"\n\nA second study, by academics at Imperial College, will carry out at a deeper investigation of a number of confirmed cases in schools.\n\nThey aim to identify whether both symptomatic and asymptomatic children transmit the virus as well as looking at possible means of transmission both at school and within households.\n\nBoth studies are funded by the National Institute for Health Research and UK Research and Innovation.",

            "Text": "Children can carry coronavirus in their noses for up to three weeks, according to a study from South Korea.\n\nBut the presence of the virus in a swab doesn't mean someone is necessarily capable of passing it on.\n\nThese findings leave unresolved question of how likely children are to spread the virus to others.\n\nThey emphasise the continuing role of social distancing and good hygiene as children go back to school.\n\nThe president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, Prof Russell Viner explains there are three separate, but linked questions about children and Covid-19:\n\nDo children get the virus?\nHow severely do they get the virus?\nDo they pass it on to others?\nWhile we know for sure that children can catch the virus, Prof Viner says data from antibody blood tests suggest they may be less susceptible to catching it than adults - particularly children under the age of 12.\n\nAnd scientists are very confident that children are less likely to become ill than adults even if they do catch it, with many not showing any symptoms at all. That's what a British study, published on Friday, confirms.\n\nThe third question is the one we know least about, and it's this the South Korean study claims to address. What does the South Korean study say?\nThe study, based on 91 children, found that even among those with few or no symptoms, virus could be found in their swabs as much as three weeks later.\n\nThe fact they had detectable virus in their noses, the authors concluded, suggested they were capable of passing it on.\n\nBecause of the way South Korea tested, traced and isolated cases, even those without symptoms, it is uniquely placed to look at this group.\n\nOnce they had identified and isolated cases, the patients were repeatedly tested until the virus had cleared.\n\nThe study was therefore able to give us some new information about children as carriers of the virus, and their potential capacity to be spreading it onwards.\n\nLike other studies, though, it still leaves a missing piece of the puzzle.\n\nJust because virus is found in a child's nose does not definitively prove they are transmitting it at the same rate as adults.\n\nDr Roberta DeBiasi, chief of the paediatric diseases division at the Children's National Hospital in Washington DC, said it would be \"illogical to think children have no role in transmission\" given they do carry the virus.\n\nBut professor of child health at the University of Liverpool, Prof Calum Semple said: \"The presence of the virus genetic material in swabs in the respiratory tract need not equate with transmission, particularly in people who do not have important symptoms such as cough and sneeze.\"\n\nSo can we draw a conclusion?\nLogic dictates that in both children and adults, people with no or few symptoms - who aren't coughing and projecting the virus into the air - are likely to be less infectious, and children generally get milder cases of the disease.\n\nBut significant numbers of asymptomatic people could still have a noticeable effect on the infection rate.\n\nAnd, as Prof Viner points out, keeping schools closed is not neutral either but poses its own set of risks - to children's development, education and mental health.\n\nWhile the exact risk children pose remains an open question for the moment, answering it will be vital to controlling future outbreaks.\n\nDr DeBiasi believes that while the \"vast majority of infected children have mild or unrecognised disease,\" they may play an \"important\" role in enabling the spread of infection through communities.",

            "Text": "The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given emergency authorisation to use plasma to treat Covid patients.\n\nThe technique uses antibody-rich blood plasma from people who've recovered from the disease and has already been applied to 70,000 people in the US - in trials or for the gravely ill.\n\nThe FDA says initial trials indicate it is safe, although more are needed to prove effectiveness.\n\nSeveral experts have questioned the robustness of studies into its use.\n\nThe announcement came a day after President Donald Trump accused the FDA of impeding the rollout of vaccines and therapeutics for political reasons, and on the eve of the Republican National Convention, where he will launch his campaign to win a second term in the White House.\n\nDoes the US have the world's worst coronavirus death rate?\nHow close are we to finding a treatment to coronavirus?\n\"This is what I've been looking forward to doing for a long time,\" the president told reporters on Sunday.\n\n\"I'm pleased to make a truly historic announcement in our battle against the China virus that will save countless lives.\"\n\nMr Trump described the procedure as a powerful therapy, as he appealed to Americans to come forward to donate plasma if they had recovered from Covid-19. More than 176,000 people have died from coronavirus since the start of the outbreak in the United States, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Nearly 5.7 million cases have also been confirmed nationwide. The country has had more confirmed cases and deaths than anywhere else in the world.\n\nDoes plasma treatment work?\nThe FDA had already approved the use of plasma transfusions on coronavirus patients under certain conditions.\n\nIt has now given the treatment \"emergency use authorisation\", rather than full approval, saying that early research suggests blood plasma can decrease mortality and improve patient health if it is administered within the first three days of admittance to hospital. However, more trials are needed to prove its effectiveness. The agency said it had concluded it was safe after reviewing the results of 20,000 patients who had received the treatment so far.\n\nThe FDA said people under the age of 80 who were not on a respirator and received plasma containing high levels of antibodies had a 35% better survival rate a month after the treatment than those who had received plasma with a low level of antibodies.\n\n\"It appeared that the product is safe and we're comfortable with that and we continue to see no concerning safety signals,\" said Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.\n\nIn his own comments, Mr Trump did not use such nuanced language, saying instead that the plasma treatment had been \"proven to reduce mortality by 35%\".\n\nSeveral experts, including Dr Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House's coronavirus task force, have expressed reservations about the robustness of studies so far. Many countries are using plasma as a coronavirus therapy, but it's not yet clear how effective the treatment is.\n\nThe decision by the US FDA to grant emergency use is a balance of risks. It says, based on the evidence so far, convalescent plasma may lessen the severity or shorten the length of Covid-19 illness.\n\nCertainly, sick coronavirus patients whose own immune systems are struggling to fight off the pandemic virus might get protection from a transfusion of antibody-rich plasma from someone who has successfully recovered from Covid-19.\n\nConvalescent plasma has been used to successfully treat other diseases, including Ebola.\n\nIt is generally well-tolerated, but unwanted effects can occur, including harmful allergic reactions.\n\nA recent UK analysis said it remained \"very uncertain\" whether plasma was beneficial for people admitted to hospital with Covid-19.\n\nTrials are ongoing to understand precisely which patients might benefit and by how much.\n\nExperts want \"gold standard\" evidence to inform treatment decisions and gathering that data will take time.\n\nIn a statement, the Infectious Diseases Society of America said that while there were \"some positive signals that convalescent plasma can be helpful in treating individuals with Covid-19.... we lack the randomised controlled trial data we need to better understand its utility in Covid-19 treatment\".\n\nJonathan Reiner, a professor of medicine at George Washington University, called it \"a political stunt\".\n\n\"Convalescent plasma may have some efficacy, but we need to have definitive data,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) officials said on Monday that using convalescent plasma was \"still an experimental treatment\".\n\nThey added that the risks and side effects associated with it, ranging from mild to severe, must be considered.\n\n\"There are a number of clinical trials going on around the world looking at convalescent plasma compared to the standard of care. Only a few of them have actually reported interim results... and at the moment, it's still very low-quality evidence,\" WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told a news conference.\n\nThe WHO has previously said that \"Covid-19 convalescent plasma can be made available on an experimental basis through local production provided that ethical and safety criteria are met for its preparation and use\".\n\nWhat's the latest on vaccines?\nIn a tweet on Saturday, President Trump said \"the deep state, or whoever, at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics.\n\n\"Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after [the US presidential election],\" he added.\n\nEarlier this year, US regulators gave emergency authorisation to Gilead Science Inc's remdesivir as a therapeutic treatment for coronavirus.\n\nMeanwhile, a report by the Financial Times suggests the White House is considering granting emergency authorisation for a vaccine being developed by Oxford University and pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, ahead of the US presidential election on 3 November.\n\nThe White House has not commented on the story, but a spokesperson for AstraZeneca told Reuters that efficacy results for its trials were not expected until later this year.",

He's also said excess deaths are significantly lower than elsewhere - that's the number of extra deaths above what would be expected.\n\nBut others say the US has been hit worse than other countries, pointing out it has the most recorded Covid deaths of any country in the world.\n\n\"More than 170,000 Americans have died - by far the worst performance of any nation on earth,\" Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden has said.\n\nWe've looked at three different ways you can measure the rate of Covid-19 deaths, two of which show that while the US is not the worst affected, it's among those most badly hit.\n\n1. The number of excess deaths\nFirst, there is no international standard for how you measure deaths, or their causes. And making comparisons is tricky as countries record deaths in different ways.\n\nBut experts say one of the most telling measures is how many extra deaths a country experiences above the number who would have been expected to die. This \"excess\" death data captures some potentially unrecorded coronavirus deaths, and other deaths that might be the result of strain on healthcare systems and other indirect effects of the epidemic.\n\nIt can therefore provide a more complete picture of how a country has been affected overall.\n\nMost developed countries publish excess death data, but they do it less frequently than the daily coronavirus death totals they provide.\n\nThe US experienced almost 200,000 excess deaths from the start of the outbreak up to 11 July, according to the latest data available. That's an 18% increase on previous years.\n\nAlthough the time periods are different, looking at the latest data from the world's leading industrialised nations, we can see the US has a lower proportion of excess deaths so far than Italy and the UK.\n\nThe UK has been one of the hardest hit countries, with around 26% more deaths than expected in a typical year up to the start of August.\n\nSo on this measure with the data available so far, the US is not the hardest-hit country, but this figure could change.\n\nWhile weekly deaths in the UK and Italy have gone back to expected levels, the US could move up the rankings if it continues to see above-expected numbers of deaths each week.\n\n2. The case fatality rate\nAnother measure is the case fatality rate. This is the ratio of deaths to confirmed cases - of those who tested positive for coronavirus, how many have died?\n\nPresident Trump has said: \"Our case fatality rate has continued to decline, and is lower than the European Union, and almost everywhere else in the world.\"\n\nThe US rate is relatively low compared with most major European countries, including the UK, although it isn't the lowest in the world.\n\nPercentage of coronavirus cases which lead to deaths \nBut different countries are testing to find coronavirus cases in different ways, meaning this is a hard comparison to make.\n\nA low case fatality rate could mean that widespread testing identifies lots of mild cases who were unlikely to die in the first place.\n\n3. Death rates per capita\nThe US has recorded the most deaths from coronavirus in the world, but it has a larger population than many other countries.\n\nWhen you look at deaths per capita - as a proportion of each country's population - the US is no longer top of the list, but remains in the top 10 worst-hit countries.\n\n10 countries with most coronavirus deaths per capita The US has recorded more than 52 coronavirus deaths per 100,000 people - there are a number of countries that have recorded more.\n\nThe US continues to regularly report more than 1,000 new coronavirus deaths a day, which is one of the highest daily death rates per capita in the world, according to the UK-based Our World in Data website which compiles global figures for coronavirus.\n\nHowever, there are important differences in how countries count coronavirus deaths, making exact comparisons difficult.",

            "Text": "Spain saw one of the most draconian Covid-19 lockdowns in Europe, but two months after it was lifted, the virus is spreading faster than in any neighbouring nation.\nIt now has Europe's fastest-rising caseload, with 142 positive cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the past two weeks.\nBy the time the state of emergency ended on 21 June, Spain was registering 100 to 150 cases per day. That number has risen to more than 3,000. But the number of deaths over the past week stood at 122 on Thursday, a far cry from the 950 registered on 2 April alone, the blackest day in Europe's deadliest per capita coronavirus epidemic.\nIs it just the young?\nMost of the transmission is now between young people, and around three-quarters of positives are in patients who show no symptoms.\nSpain's government admits the numbers are \"not what we want to see\", but points to key differences compared to the spring.\nOnly around 3% of current cases require hospital treatment, less than 0.5% need intensive care and the current death rate is as low as 0.3%.\n\"Mortality is very low, as is the hospitalisation rate. Something has changed big time, although the rise is still worrying,\" says Ildefonso Hern\u00e1ndez, a professor in public health from Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez University in Alicante.\n\"As long as cases are rising, we have to think that a second wave is on the way. We don't have much time to react before September's return to routines.\" Spain's tourism season has ended up as little more than a damp squib, as most countries moved to blacklist this key destination within weeks of the country opening up at the end of June.\nThat means beach areas have so far avoided the highest rates of infection, although Catalonia's infection rate is slightly above the national average on 145 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.\nWhy one region has been hit hard\nHealthcare is a competence of Spain's 17 regions, and some are looking much better prepared than others. At the good end of the scale, the northern region of Asturias has an infection rate of 32, while Arag\u00f3n in the north-east is topping 500.\nArag\u00f3n's capital, Zaragoza, has become a hotspot for community transmission over recent weeks, but the problems began in the early summer when thousands of seasonal workers, many of them wandering migrants, began to travel to orchards in the region.\n1px transparent line\nGrowers and packing companies have been criticised for not providing accommodation for migrant workers, leading them to travel between shelters and fields or subsist in insanitary shanties.\n\"Everything happening in Arag\u00f3n is very much connected to outbreaks among the seasonal fruit-pickers. There should have been more anticipation of the problems that could arise due to the accommodation situation of these workers,\" explains Juan Gonz\u00e1lez Armengol, president of the Spanish Society of Emergency Medicine (Semes).\nWorst of all, more than 55 care homes for the elderly in Arag\u00f3n have registered cases since the end of the state of emergency. There is a risk that areas that escaped the worst ravages of the spring pandemic could be hit by a second wave as autumn nears.\nIn June, Arag\u00f3n estimated around 760 deaths in residences, 10 times fewer than in Madrid.\n1px transparent line\nHow poisonous politics is putting Madrid at risk\nSpanish politics has lacked any consensus or spirit of collaboration in managing the coronavirus crisis.\nWhile the national government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has faced accusations from rivals of lying about death rates, the regional government in Madrid run by the conservative Popular Party has attracted equally fierce criticism.\nDespite a shocking collapse of Madrid's public hospital system in the spring, and with 50% more deaths than the more populous region of Catalonia, the capital is now seeing cases double week after week.\nMadrid\u2019s medical heroes in fight of their lives\nSpanish regions ban smoking over Covid-19 risk\nSpain's holiday islands shake off party image\nWaiting for tourists on Spain's Costa del Sol\nMadrid had fewer than 200 contact tracers by the end of July. Double that number had been promised, and even that was half the figure recommended by the medical community. \"Among the factors for the high infection numbers we are seeing, the quality of Spain's democracy is playing a part. Were accountability stricter, it would not be acceptable that some regions - and not just Madrid - are taking so long to put measures in place,\" says Prof Hern\u00e1ndez.\n2px presentational grey line\nSpain's Covid-19 pandemic\nOfficially, 28,813 have died from Covid-19 - Spain's health ministry counts only those who tested positive for the virus\nAccording to excess death statistics, close to 44,596 are believed to have died from the illness\nThe Spanish government says more than 19,000 elderly people have died in care homes, although only around half have been included in the official death toll\nAs infections surged, hospitals in many areas stopped sending ambulances to care homes, so residents died undiagnosed and often with very little treatment\n\"Never again can we leave our old people to die alone and afraid,\" said Ximena Di Lollo of Doctors Without Borders, which has criticised a lack of preparation and poor staffing levels.\nInside story of Spain's care home tragedy\n2px presentational grey line\nHow Spain's youth accelerated northern surge\nFor three months, Spaniards were under lockdown. That meant many young people were stuck in their family homes.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, street parties and night life are now being signalled as the biggest catalysts of new outbreaks along with family gatherings.\nTown and city festivals have all been cancelled. That did not stop crowds gathering in Navarre's capital of Pamplona for the 7 July start date of the world-famous San Ferm\u00edn bull-running fiesta. Last Friday 400 young revellers paraded the streets of nearby Tafalla, marking the town's \"non-festival\".\nIn the neighbouring Basque Country, which is just ahead of Navarre as Spain's third worst-affected region this month, youthful gatherings have also been linked to outbreaks.\nOf the 350 people called to turn up for testing after a busy night at Bilbao's Back&Stage nightclub last month, at least 34 proved positive, the kind of result that has prompted an agreement between Spain's authorities to close down all nightlife after 01:00.\n\"It was like any other night at the club and many people were not wearing a face mask even when dancing. I was among the first to take mine off,\" 18-year-old Arkaitz Serrano told newspaper El Pa\u00eds. \"Spaniards were extremely fastidious about following the rules during the lockdown, but there has been a massive relaxation now we have returned to a kind of normality,\" notes Prof Hern\u00e1ndez.\nUnder new emergency powers, the Basque government this week banned so-called botell\u00f3n parties, alcohol-fuelled outdoor gatherings of young people.\nBut the botell\u00f3n is a national problem.\nIn Madrid the regional government has asked for police reinforcements to seek out and break up such parties, whose numbers are rising as restrictions on nightclubs and bars take effect.",

            "Text": "Indoor and outdoor social gatherings of more than six people will be banned in England from Monday as coronavirus restrictions are tightened. Although larger households are able to gather within their bubbles, some can no longer meet up with friends and family.\n\nBefore the pandemic hit, Alison Keen had planned a big party for her 40th birthday on 21 September. When lockdown happened, she postponed it until 2021 and instead had hoped for a family gathering. But now that too cannot go ahead.\n\nShe and her husband have four children, meaning the new \"rule of six\" applies solely to their family.\n\n\"I can't meet up with anyone just because I've got kids,\" said Mrs Keen, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire.\n\n\"Mum's upset that she can't see me on my birthday and really annoyed that she could have come to see the kids last week, but not next week.\"\n\nMrs Keen said allowing her children, between six and 11, to go back to school but not have family gatherings \"seems daft\".\n\nHer parents, who live in Birmingham, will still be able to see Mrs Keen's two sisters, who both have fewer children and can meet up without exceeding six people. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the new rules \"to avoid a second national lockdown\" as the rate of infection climbs across the country.\n\nIt applies both indoors and outdoors and to all ages - although there are some exemptions, such as gatherings for work or school.\n\nThe new rules will be enforced by police who will have powers to issue fines and make arrests.\n\n\"I get they're trying to simplify the rules, but that's not how viruses work,\" said Mrs Keen.\n\n\"At the end of the day it's a new virus and as you learn, policies have to evolve. But it feels awful.\" Dee Jones, a mum of six from Telford, in Shropshire, said the new restrictions means she won't be able to see all of her children, five of whom have moved out and married.\n\nShe works two jobs and so only has one weekend off each month - the family would normally use that weekend to get together for a big meal.\n\n\"We can't do that now, unless my son-in-law sits out in the garden and eats his dinner there.\"\n\nThe \"rule of six\" will make it almost impossible to arrange seeing her family and already they are having to do so \"almost on a rota\".\n\nShe said a turkey, bought for the family's Easter meal, had been \"stuck in the freezer all throughout lockdown - if I didn't laugh about it I would have cried\", adding she was finding the restrictions \"quite depressing\".\n\n\"Honestly, it's ridiculous. I'm frustrated. We've done what we've been advised and there are clearly people out there who haven't.\" Stephanie Raheel, from Yardley in Birmingham, has three children, Alina, Amaya and Arissa.\n\nHer husband's parents are at the heart of their family and they would usually meet them regularly with extended family members.\n\nTo go back to stricter measures will be hard, she said, \"especially for the children - it's hard for them to understand\".\n\nLatest news and updates from the West Midlands\nSo how many friends can I meet - and where?\nWhat can police do if I break the new rules?\nMrs Raheel's children, aged between three and six, have returned to school and nursery but she worries the restrictions will mean the older people in her family will miss out on special moments with her young daughters.\n\n\"Within our family we've had two babies born in lockdown,\" she said. \"The key moments, you want to celebrate with your loved ones.\n\n\"The grandparents too, they love to see the little ones.\" Mrs Raheel said her mother-in-law is due to have an eye operation next week, something her husband and his six brothers are keen to support her with.\n\n\"We'll all just want to go and see her and check she's OK - when people are in need, it's difficult.\"\n\nShe is not sure how the family will be able to keep checking in on loved ones without breaking the new restrictions, but thinks they will just have to take it in turns to visit.\n\n\"Everyone is just a little bit puzzled about why it is six people, and they're not shutting restaurants and pubs - it just doesn't make any sense.\n\n\"There are so many different things you're allowed to do and not allowed to do, we just have to accept that's the way it is.\"",

            "HeadLine": "Covid-19: Five ways to avoid catching the virus indoors",
            "Text": "Good ventilation could be the key to avoiding coronavirus as autumn approaches and people spend more time indoors.\nFor months we've been told to wash our hands and maintain social distancing to beat coronavirus.\nBut scientists and engineers say we also need to think about the air we breathe, as children go back to school and more people return to offices.\nGood ventilation matters in five ways.\n1: If it's stuffy, walk away\nWhen you walk into a room and the air feels stale, something is wrong with the ventilation.\nNot enough fresh air is being introduced, which increases your chances of getting infected by coronavirus.\nRecent research shows that in confined spaces there can be \"airborne transmission\" of the virus - with tiny virus particles lingering in the air.\nAccording to workplace regulations set up before the pandemic, everyone should get 10 litres of fresh air every second, and that matters more than ever now.\nSo if a place seems stuffy, just turn around and leave, says Dr Hywel Davies, technical director of the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers.\nHe says that it's vital to have a flow of clean air:\n\"If you've got someone who's infected in a building, and you're bringing in plenty of outside air, you're diluting whatever infectious material they're giving off. You're reducing the risk of other people becoming infected.\"\n2: Look up at the air conditioning\nFrom offices to shops, air conditioning is welcome on hot days - but check the type of unit.\nThe simplest is a slender white box mounted on walls or ceilings, known as a split air conditioner.\nThis draws in air from a room, chills it and then blows it back out again. In other words, it's recirculating the air.\nThis is no problem for a quick visit but may be a risk over a period of hours.\nA study of a restaurant in China blamed this type of air conditioner for spreading the virus.\nOne customer was \"pre-symptomatic\" - in other words, he was infected but did not realise because he had yet to develop symptoms.\nScientists reckon he released the virus as he breathed and talked, and it was pushed around the room by swirling air currents from the units on the wall.\nThe result was that nine other people became infected.\nDr Davies points again to the importance of fresh air:\n\"If there had been a good supply of outside air, very likely fewer people would have become infected - if any.\"\n3: Ask about the 'fresh air ratio'\nIn a modern building where the windows are sealed, how can you get enough fresh air?\nYou're relying on a ventilation system in which stale air is extracted from the rooms and piped to an air handling unit, often on the roof. There, fresh air can be pulled in from outside and mixed with the old inside air, before being sent back into the building.\nGiven the risk of coronavirus infection, the professional advice is to maximise the fresh supply.\n\"Having 100% outside air or close to 100% is a good thing,\" says Prof Cath Noakes of the University of Leeds and chair of the environmental panel of the government's SAGE advisers, speaking in a personal capacity.\n\"The more fresh air, the less you're running the risk of recirculating the virus through the building.\"\nThe precise mix is decided by the building's managers, who may be working for the owners or the tenants. .\nThe drawback to running 100% fresh air is the cost - the incoming air has to be heated in winter and cooled in summer, all of which requires energy.\n4: Check if there's virus in the filters\nA modern ventilation system will have filters but these are not fool-proof.\nIn the US, researchers investigating the Oregon Health & Science University Hospital found that traces of coronavirus were trapped by the filters but some had somehow slipped through.\nProf Kevin van den Wymelenberg, who led the project, believes that swabbing the filters could reveal if there's someone infected working in a building.\nIn South Korea, a call centre on the 11th floor of an office building saw one person infect more than 90 others.\nIf the filters had been checked more frequently, the presence of the virus might have been spotted sooner.\nProf van den Wymelenberg says data from filters can \"show us where to punch and when to punch\" in tackling infections.\n5: Watch out for draughts\nTalk to any expert in the field and they will say that fresh air is the key.\nBut one specialist in modelling the movement of air says it's not that simple.\nNick Wirth used to design Formula 1 racing cars, and now advises supermarkets and food-processing companies on how to manage air flow to keep people safe. He worries that if someone sitting beside an open window turns out to be infectious, they could shed virus to others downwind.\n\"If you open a window, where is the air going to go?\" he asks. \"We don't want people in a direct line of that airflow.\n\"More fresh air in general is better but if it's flowing horizontally and full of virus it could have unintended consequences.\"\nI put this scenario to Prof Cath Noakes.\nShe says the benefits of plentiful fresh air diluting the virus will outweigh any risks.\nAn open window might lead to more people receiving the virus but in smaller, less risky amounts, in her view.\nIt's no surprise there are disagreements - there's a lot we still don't know about the virus.\nBut the air we breathe is bound to be part of any effort to make buildings safer.",

But having asthma - unlike being obese - had not made the children more likely to need intensive care.\n\nOf the children studied, 52 were also diagnosed with a multisystem inflammatory syndrome linked to coronavirus, with the first case seen by doctors in mid-March.\n\nThese children - none of whom died - were more likely than the others to be older, about 10, and from ethnic minorities.\n\nAnd they were five times more likely to be admitted to intensive care, where they responded well to treatment.\n\n'Higher incidence'\nBased on their study, the definition of this syndrome could now be broadened to include symptoms such as fatigue, headache, sore throat and muscle pain, the researchers said, on top of the symptoms already listed by the World Health Organization.\n\nDr Liz Whittaker, of Imperial College London, said the findings echoed other studies of Covid-19 in children.\n\n\"Very low numbers of children have been admitted to critical care and the researchers reported a very low death rate - particularly in comparison to adults but also in comparison to the death rate due to other infections, influenza, chicken pox, meningitis, group-A-strep[tococcus] sepsis etc, and other causes of childhood death - for example, road traffic accidents,\" she said.\n\nThe fact black children were more commonly affected by the very rare inflammatory syndrome \"reflects the higher incidence of coronavirus infection in these communities\", Dr Whittaker added.",

Most people recover having only experienced mild symptoms. Steroids calm down inflammation and the immune system, which is why they are already used in conditions like arthritis and asthma, as well as in some severe infections.\n\nThe drugs are not thought to be helpful in the early stages of a coronavirus infection - when symptoms include a cough, fever or a sudden loss of taste or smell.\n\nBut as the disease develops, the immune system can go into overdrive, damaging the lungs and other organs.\n\nIt is this stage of Covid that steroids are thought to help with.\n\n\"At the point at which you reach for an oxygen cylinder for a patient with Covid, you probably should be reaching for the prescription for corticosteroids,\" said Prof Martin Landray, from the University of Oxford.\n\n\"These results are instantly useable; they are widely available, cheap, well-understood drugs that reduce mortality.\"\n\nDoctors are already using dexamethasone after the results earlier in the year, but the hope is that having the choice of different drugs will increase access to the treatment around the world.\n\nThe drugs can either be swallowed as tablets or given via intravenous drip.\n\nThe research so far has focused on low doses of steroids. There is no evidence that higher doses would be more effective.\n\nNew guidelines for doctors are expected to be released by the World Health Organization.\n\nIn the UK, NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said: \"Just as we did with dexamethasone, the NHS will now take immediate action to ensure that patients who could benefit from treatment with hydrocortisone do so, adding a further weapon in the armoury in the worldwide fight against Covid-19.\"",

            "Text": "The loss of smell that can accompany coronavirus is unique and different from that experienced by someone with a bad cold or flu, say European researchers who have studied the experiences of patients.\n\nWhen Covid-19 patients have smell loss it tends to be sudden and severe.\n\nAnd they usually don't have a blocked, stuffy or runny nose - most people with coronavirus can still breathe freely.\n\nAnother thing that sets them apart is their \"true\" loss of taste.\n\nIt's not that their taste is somewhat impaired because their sense of smell is out of action, say the researchers in the journal Rhinology. Coronavirus patients with loss of taste really cannot tell the difference between bitter or sweet.\n\nExperts suspect this is because the pandemic virus affects the nerve cells directly involved with smell and taste sensation.\n\nThe main symptoms of coronavirus are:\n\nhigh temperature\nnew, continuous cough\nloss of smell or taste\nAnyone with these symptoms should self-isolate and arrange to have a swab test to check if they have the virus. Members of their household should isolate too to prevent possible spread.\n\nCoronavirus: What are the rules? Smell research\nLead investigator Prof Carl Philpott, from the University of East Anglia, carried out smell and taste tests on 30 volunteers: 10 with Covid-19, 10 with bad colds and 10 healthy people with no cold or flu symptoms Smell loss was much more profound in the Covid-19 patients. They were less able to identify smells, and they were not able to discern bitter or sweet tastes at all.\n\nProf Philpott, who works with the charity Fifth Sense, which was set up to help with people with smell and taste disorders, said: \"There really do appear to be distinguishing features that set the coronavirus apart from other respiratory viruses.\n\n\"This is very exciting because it means that smell and taste tests could be used to discriminate between Covid-19 patients and people with a regular cold or flu.\"\n\nHe said people could do their own smell and taste tests at home using products like coffee, garlic, oranges or lemons and sugar.\n\nHe stressed that diagnostic throat and nose swab tests were still essential if someone thought they might have coronavirus.\n\nThe senses of smell and taste return within a few weeks in most people who recover from coronavirus, he added.\n\nCoronavirus wiped out my sense of smell\nProf Andrew Lane is an expert in nose and sinus problems at Johns Hopkins University in the US.\n\nHe and his team have been studying tissue samples from the back of the nose to understand how coronavirus might cause loss of smell and have published the findings in the European Respiratory Journal.\n\nThey identified extremely high levels of an enzyme which were present only in the area of the nose responsible for smelling.\n\nThis enzyme, called ACE-2 (angiotensin converting enzyme II), is thought to be the \"entry point\" that allows coronavirus to get into the cells of the body and cause an infection.\n\nThe nose is one of the places where Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, enters the body.\n\nProf Lane said: \"We are now doing more experiments in the lab to see whether the virus is indeed using these cells to access and infect the body.\n\n\"If that's the case, we may be able to tackle the infection with antiviral therapies delivered directly through the nose.\"",

            "Text": "Coronavirus will be present \"forever in some form or another\", a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has said.\n\nSir Mark Walport said people would need to be vaccinated at regular intervals.\n\nHis comments come after the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said he hoped the pandemic would be over within two years, as the Spanish flu had taken two years to overcome.\n\nSir Mark said denser populations and travel meant the virus spread easily.\n\nHe also said the world population was now much larger than in 1918.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Mark said that, in order to control the pandemic, \"global vaccination\" would be required, but coronavirus would not be a disease like smallpox \"which could be eradicated by vaccination\".\n\nWhere are the world's coronavirus hotspots?\nUK tourists dash home as quarantine rules kick in\n\"This is a virus that is going to be with us forever in some form or another, and almost certainly will require repeated vaccinations,\" he said.\n\n\"So, a bit like flu, people will need re-vaccination at regular intervals.\"\n\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO, has said that the Spanish flu of 1918 took two years to overcome, and that advances in technology could allow the world to halt coronavirus \"in a shorter time\". The flu of 1918 killed at least 50 million people.\n\nCoronavirus has so far killed 800,000 people. Nearly 23 million infections have been recorded but the number of people who have actually had the virus is thought to be much higher due to inadequate testing and asymptomatic cases. Sir Mark warned that it was \"possible\" coronavirus would get \"out of control\" again, but said more targeted measures could now be used instead of a generic lockdown.\n\nCoronavirus cases have been increasing in European countries in recent weeks. Some nations, which had appeared successful in suppressing the initial outbreaks, are now seeing infections rise again.\n\nAs of 22 August, the UK recorded 21.5 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people over the last fortnight, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\nSir Mark said: \"We know that less than one in five people around the country have been infected, so 80% of the population are still susceptible to this virus.\n\n\"It is this terrible balance between trying to minimise the harm to people from the infection and protecting people, whilst keeping society going.\"\n\nHe said he was worried about the rise in the number of cases in Europe and other parts of the world. Meanwhile, tourists returning to the UK spent thousands of pounds arranging new flights in a race to get home before new travel rules came into force.\n\nFrom 04:00 BST on Saturday, travellers coming back from Croatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago must quarantine for 14 days.\n\nThere were similar scenes last weekend when new rules kicked in for those returning from countries including France and the Netherlands.",

            "Text": "The 1918 influenza pandemic was the most severe pandemic in recent history. It was caused by an H1N1 virus with genes of avian origin. Although there is not universal consensus regarding where the virus originated, it spread worldwide during 1918-1919.  In the United States, it was first identified in military personnel in spring 1918. It is estimated that about 500 million people or one-third of the world\u2019s population became infected with this virus. The number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide with about 675,000 occurring in the United States. Mortality was high in people younger than 5 years old, 20-40 years old, and 65 years and older. The high mortality in healthy people, including those in the 20-40 year age group, was a unique feature of this pandemic. While the 1918 H1N1 virus has been synthesized and evaluated, the properties that made it so devastating are not well understood. With no vaccine to protect against influenza infection and no antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections that can be associated with influenza infections, control efforts worldwide were limited to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as isolation, quarantine, good personal hygiene, use of disinfectants, and limitations of public gatherings, which were applied unevenly.",

            "Text": "The (H1N1)pdm09 virus was very different from H1N1 viruses that were circulating at the time of the pandemic. Few young people had any existing immunity (as detected by antibody response) to the (H1N1)pdm09 virus, but nearly one-third of people over 60 years old had antibodies against this virus, likely from exposure to an older H1N1 virus earlier in their lives. Since the (H1N1)pdm09 virus was very different from circulating H1N1 viruses, vaccination with seasonal flu vaccines offered little cross-protection against (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. While a monovalent (H1N1)pdm09 vaccine was produced, it was not available in large quantities until late November\u2014after the peak of illness during the second wave had come and gone in the United States. From April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010, CDC estimated there were 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (range: 195,086-402,719), and 12,469 deaths (range: 8868-18,306) in the United States due to the (H1N1)pdm09 virus. Additionally, CDC estimated that 151,700-575,400 people worldwide died from (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection during the first year the virus circulated.** Globally, 80 percent of (H1N1)pdm09 virus-related deaths were estimated to have occurred in people younger than 65 years of age. This differs greatly from typical seasonal influenza epidemics, during which about 70 percent to 90 percent of deaths are estimated to occur in people 65 years and older.\n\nThough the 2009 flu pandemic primarily affected children and young and middle-aged adults, the impact of the (H1N1)pdm09 virus on the global population during the first year was less severe than that of previous pandemics. Estimates of pandemic influenza mortality ranged from 0.03 percent of the world\u2019s population during the 1968 H3N2 pandemic to 1 percent to 3 percent of the world\u2019s population during the 1918 H1N1 pandemic. It is estimated that 0.001 percent to 0.007 percent of the world\u2019s population died of respiratory complications associated with (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection during the first 12 months the virus circulated.\n\nThe United States mounted a complex, multi-faceted and long-term response to the pandemic, summarized in The 2009 H1N1 Pandemic: Summary Highlights, April 2009-April 2010. On August 10, 2010, WHO declared an end to the global 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. However, (H1N1)pdm09 virus continues to circulate as a seasonal flu virus, and cause illness, hospitalization, and deaths worldwide every year.",

President Obama meets Wednesday with top advisers to discuss plans regarding the H1N1 virus.\n\nAmong other things, he said, people should wash their hands frequently and stay home from work if they are ill.\n\n\"I know it sounds simple, but it's important and it works,\" he said at the White House.\n\n\"I don't want anybody to be alarmed. But I do want (people) to be prepared.\"\n\nThe president said hospitals need to prepare for an unusually large influx of patients. While the federal government is doing everything possible to prepare for a new H1N1 outbreak, there will likely be \"issues coming up over the next several months,\" Obama said. The way the virus is \"moving is still somewhat unpredictable.\"\n\nFamilies and businesses, he said, should have plans in place in the event that relatives or co-workers contract the virus and need to remain at home.\n\nState and local governments need to be \"on the front lines to make anti-viral medications and vaccines available,\" he added. Video Watch President Obama discuss what precautions people can take \u00bb\n\nThe president made his remarks after receiving a briefing on preparedness for H1N1, also known as swine flu, from several senior administration officials. He met with Homeland Security Adviser John Brennan, Education Secretary Arne Duncan, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, Commerce Secretary Gary Locke and Health, and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, among others.\n\nObama's remarks came one week after a presidential advisory panel estimated the H1N1 virus could cause up to 90,000 U.S. deaths, mainly among children and young adults, when infections surge upward as expected this fall.\n\nSeasonal flu, in contrast, typically kills an average of about 36,000 Americans each year, according to the CDC, mainly people 65 and older and young children.\n\nWith both types of flu, people with chronic medical conditions and pregnant women also are at higher risk.\n\nH1N1 could infect between 30 percent to 50 percent of the American population during fall and winter and lead to as many as 1.8 million hospital admissions, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology reported.\n\nThe fall H1N1 resurgence may begin with the start of the school year and may peak in mid-October, the report said. A vaccine against H1N1 is being tested but is not expected to be available until at least mid-October, health officials have noted.\n\nThe vaccine will likely require two shots at least one week apart, and because it typically takes a couple of weeks for a person's immunity to build up after vaccination, most Americans would not be protected until sometime in November.\n\nVaccinations will be voluntary but \"strongly recommended,\" Obama said.\n\nIn a separate meeting Tuesday, Napolitano and Washington-area leaders expressed confidence in the region's planning for the H1N1 virus.\n\nMaryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine said state budget problems will not impact public health care.\n\n\"We are confident that we are going to be able, notwithstanding those challenges, to distribute vaccinations as they become available. ...

            "Text": "(CNN) -- The swine flu outbreak is spawning debate about how people get information during health emergencies -- especially at a time when news sources are becoming less centralized. Buzz about swine flu on Twitter is stirring conversations about how people get health news.\n\nSome observers say Twitter -- a micro-blogging site where users post 140-character messages -- has become a hotbed of unnecessary hype and misinformation about the outbreak, which is thought to have claimed more than 100 lives in Mexico.\n\n\"This is a good example of why [Twitter is] headed in that wrong direction, because it's just propagating fear amongst people as opposed to seeking actual solutions or key information,\" said Brennon Slattery, a contributing writer for PC World. \"The swine flu thing came really at the crux of a media revolution.\"\n\nTwitter's popularity has exploded in recent months, and Slattery said it's a new development that a wide number of people would turn to the site in search of information during an emergency.\n\nA spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, however, said that the online buzz about swine flu is a good sign. It means people are talking about the issue, and that's the first step toward learning how to reasonably protect yourself.\n\n\"I think it's generally a useful development, but I would encourage people to look to other sources, especially established, recognized medical authorities,\" said Glen Nowak, chief of media relations at the CDC. \"It shows that people are engaged and they care and that it's caught their attention -- and those all are good things.\"\n\nDon't Miss\nWHO raises pandemic alert level\nWatch videos on swine flu outbreak\nSeveral dozen cases of swine flu worldwide have been confirmed by the World Health Organization and hundreds more are feared. Read more about the situation\n\nThat information needs to be put in context by journalists, especially given the fact that so many deaths from the common flu occur each year and go underreported by the news media, said Al Tompkins, who teaches broadcast and online news at the Poynter Institute, a school for journalists. Follow CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta on Twitter\n\nAbout 36,000 people die from flu-related symptoms each year in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe fast pace of new swine flu cases and their relevance to global public health policy makes the situation newsworthy, Tompkins said.\n\nTompkins said there is a tendency for television stations to hype health emergencies to boost their ratings, but so far coverage of the swine flu outbreak has been responsible. Coverage of the story is just ramping up, though, he said.\n\nHealth Library\nMayoClinic.com: Influenza (flu)\nOf the swine flu news on Twitter, Tompkins said, \"Bad news always travels faster than good news. I'm sure that was true in smoke signal days.\"\n\nUnofficial swine flu information on Twitter may lead people to unwise decisions, said Evgeny Morozov, a fellow at the Open Society Institute and a blogger on ForeignPolicy.com.\n\nFor example, some Twitter users told their followers to stop eating pork, he said. Health officials have not advised that precaution. Read about how the virus is transmitted\n\nMorozov said there's incentive for Twitter users to post whatever is on their mind because it helps them grow their online audiences.\n\nBut in an emergency, that tendency means people write about their own fears of symptoms and widespread deaths, which can create an uninformed hysteria, he said.\n\nThe debate about swine flu on Twitter is not one-sided, however. And the site is not the only place online where people are talking about the outbreak.\n\nSome Twitter users have expressed concern that the swine flu story is being hyped. Several media outlets, including the BBC and CNN's iReport.com, give readers and viewers a chance to express their own views about the outbreak.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also maintains its own Twitter account where official government information is given straight to the public.\n\nAnd on Monday, President Obama seemed to try to calm national fears by saying the outbreak is \"cause for concern and requires a heightened state of alert\" but is not a \"cause for alarm,\" CNN reported.\n\nTwitter traffic about swine flu has been strong. According to Nielsen Online, swine flu has worked its way into about 2 percent of all notes posted on the site on Monday. You can follow that Twitter conversation here.\n\nChatter about swine flu is also loud elsewhere online. About 10 times more people are writing online about swine flu than wrote about the salmonella and peanut butter scares from this winter, Nielsen says.\n\nAn interactive map created using the free Google Maps service lets Internet users see where outbreak deaths have been confirmed and where they are suspected. See a CNN map\n\nSlattery, the PC World contributor, also criticized television news stations like CNN and Fox News for hyping the story and adding to public fear.\n\nHe said he generally was excited about Twitter until recently. Now, it's changing, and he finds the site to be \"an incredibly unreliable source of information.\"\n\nNowak, of the CDC, said the media has done a good job of informing the public about the outbreak. He said some headlines, however, have been a bit sensational.\n\nTompkins said people who post information on social media sites should think about the credibility of their sources before they pass something on.",

Marine spokesman Maj. David Nevers told the Associated Press that the man's condition is improving.\n\nMeanwhile, President Barack Obama said Wednesday that U.S. public health officials were recommending that schools with confirmed or suspected cases of swine flu \"should strongly consider temporarily closing so that we can be as safe as possible,\" the AP reported.\n\nAt a press briefing Wednesday morning, Besser said there were now 91 confirmed cases of infection with the never-before-seen virus in 10 states, with the one death. Sixty-four percent of the cases involve people under age 18, but patients range in age from 8 to 81, he said.\n\nBorder surveillance has been increased to actively look for cases of infection, he said.\n\nKathleen Sebelius, the new secretary of U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS), said at the briefing that, \"while we still don't know what this virus will do, we expect to see more cases, more hospitalizations and, unfortunately, we are likely to see additional deaths from the outbreak.\" \"Currently, the FDA [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] and the CDC are developing virus reference strains -- the information that is necessary to develop a vaccine,\" Sebelius said. \"Today, there are a series of steps that HHS is taking in vaccine development. The process is more speedy than it has ever been before.\"\n\nThe earliest a vaccine could be ready is this fall, said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nDuring a press briefing Tuesday, Besser had said that the cases of infection found in the United States so far continued to be mild, but more severe cases were expected, and \"as we move forward, I fully expect we will see deaths.\"\n\nMany of the swine flu cases in the United States come from a New York City high school that had previously reported 18 cases of the infectious disease, Besser said.\n\nBesser said the incubation period for the U.S. cases is two to seven days, which, he said, \"is typical for what you see with an influenza virus.\"\n\nThe majority of new cases in New York continued to come at St. Francis Preparatory School in Queens. Some students who have come down with the infection had been to Mexico -- believed to be the source of the outbreak -- during a spring break trip to Cancun, the AP reported.\n\nTexas has postponed all public high school sports and academic competitions at least until May 11 due to the outbreak.\n\nAs with the previously tested strains of the swine flu virus, new testing found that the pathogen remains susceptible to the two common antiviral drugs Tamiflu and Relenza, according to an April 28 dispatch from the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.\n\nThe new flu strain is a combination of pig, bird and human viruses, prompting worries from health officials that humans may have no natural immunity to the virus.\n\nMeanwhile, the AP reported that the epidemic had crossed new borders, with the first cases confirmed in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region. Canada, Austria, New Zealand, Israel, Spain, Britain and Germany also have reported cases of swine flu sickness. Deaths reported so far have been limited to Mexico, and now the United States.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cuba and then Argentina suspended flights to and from Mexico, becoming the first countries to impose a travel ban, even though the World Health Organization (WHO) has said such bans were ineffective because the virus has already taken root in more than one country, the AP said.\n\nIn Mexico, meanwhile, the toll from the swine flu epidemic appeared to be stabilizing, health officials there said late Tuesday, with only seven more suspected deaths, CBS News reported.\n\nThe virus is suspected in 159 deaths and 2,498 illnesses across Mexico, said Health Secretary Jose Cordova, who called the death toll \"more or less stable.\" He said only 1,311 suspected swine flu patients remain hospitalized, a sign that treatment works for people who get medical care quickly, the news network reported.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. officials said they were tightening their travel advisory to Mexico, recommending that all non-essential travel to that country be avoided.\n\nThe United States has stepped up checks of people entering the country by air, land and sea, looking for signs of infection, and the CDC plans to distribute \"yellow cards at ports of entry,\" Besser said Monday.\n\n\"These will provide information on swine flu, so that people coming into the United States will have information about this outbreak -- what to do if they become sick, what things they can do to prevent the likelihood that they will become sick,\" he said.\n\nHe also said U.S. officials were questioning border visitors about their health, looking for signs of possible infection.",

            "Text": "Hong Kong (CNN)In 2003, panic was setting in. The fatal severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) -- which first appeared in southern China -- had spread across borders, prompting schools to close in Singapore and hundreds to be quarantined in Hong Kong.\n\nIn the Chinese city of Wuhan, some 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from the origin of the outbreak, Li -- then a 15-year-old high school student -- was cramming for exams.\nClasses were running, but students were told they couldn't go home between their afternoon and evening classes, so parents clustered outside the school gate to pass boxes of food to their children.\nLi, not his real name, said his school smelled of vinegar, due to a belief that vinegar fumes would help prevent the spread of disease. CNN agreed to Li's request not to publish his name -- he's now an academic and fears any perceived criticism of the government could damage his career.\nFor Li, SARS didn't feel like something he was going to catch himself. Back then, there were no high-speed trains linking Wuhan with other cities, and the southern province of Guangdong, where the outbreak started, felt very far away. Some people wore masks, others didn't.\nAlmost two decades later, Asia is on the brink of another pandemic, say experts. For many, it feels eerily similar to the SARS outbreak that infected over 8,000 people and killed 774 around the world between November 2002 and July 2003. SARS is also a type of coronavirus, which causes flu-like symptoms, and can mutate as it spreads from person to person.\nIn the past month, at least 41 people have died and more than a thousand people have been diagnosed as infected by the Wuhan coronavirus, a cousin of SARS. Cases have been reported in a number of countries, including the United States, France, and Singapore.\nTransport is on lockdown in Wuhan -- a city of 11 million and the epicenter of the virus -- and in 10 nearby cities. This is all happening at the worst possible time of year: Lunar New Year, the most significant holiday in the Chinese calendar, when three billion trips were expected to be made. Even before Wuhan closed train stations and airports, Li -- who is now 31 and working in Macao -- decided, for the first time in his adult life, not to go home for Lunar New Year, which is also known in the mainland as Spring Festival. He worries for his family's health, but says there's little he personally can do.\n\"I would hope the government learned a lesson from what happened 17 years ago,\" said Li. \"It seems like they are taking the issue seriously, but I am not sure if it is a little bit too late.\"\nSix weeks into the outbreak, there are signs that China is handling this outbreak differently. But there's still concern over China's response -- and just how transparent Beijing is being. What went wrong during SARS\nIn the first few months of the 2003 SARS outbreak, China kept the disease under wraps.\nSARS was first publicly reported in February 2003, but by that time the country was already months into an outbreak. Five people had died and another 300 had fallen ill from the disease in Guangdong province.\nIn April 2003, a prominent doctor in Beijing went on the record to accuse the government of a cover-up. Later that month, China sacked its health minister and the mayor of Beijing over their mishandling of the outbreak.\nAnd it wasn't until April -- around five months after the outbreak started -- that American and Canadian scientists announced they had sequenced the genome thought to be the cause of the SARS virus. The lack of transparency from China, combined with a lack of knowledge about what the virus was and a lack of preparedness among countries in the region in dealing with pandemics, all contributed to SARS's deadly impact.\nIn semi-autonomous Hong Kong, over 280 people died from SARS -- the highest proportion of death per capita of any territory in the world.\n\"The outbreak was very, very difficult to control. At that time, we had no idea what caused the pandemic,\" said Ivan Hung, a specialist in infectious disease at Hong Kong University. \"We were not able to get on top of things and able to make early diagnosis and isolation as a result. There was a lot of cross infection that happened in the hospital.\" SARS also exposed how ill-prepared China and other territories were at responding to pandemics. In a paper published soon after the epidemic was contained, Hong Kong's former Director of Health Lee Shiu-hung pointed to a number of issues facing the city, including a lack of protective clothing for medical staff, ill-prepared hospital authorities, and basic failings in the healthcare system, like overcrowded wards and poor ventilation.\nAs Hung puts it, last time around, public health authorities were \"playing catch up.\"\nGrace -- a 37-year-old Hong Konger -- was interning at a hotel at the time, and remembers the fear. At her hotel, everyone wore a mask, and people cleaned their hands and phones before starting work.\n\"Everyone was worried because nobody knew how serious it was. Everybody had to wear masks wherever they go. Business was not good as well,\" said Grace, who asked CNN not to use her last name out of concern for the impact of her current job. \"People preferred to stay at home if they didn't have to go to work or school.\" A different China\nIn the six weeks since the first case of Wuhan coronavirus was detected, it's already clear that today's China isn't the same as the China of 2003.\nChina informed the World Health Organization about the new virus on December 31, 2019, less than three weeks after the first case was detected on December 12. The virus behind the outbreak was identified on January 7 -- as swift as any other developed country would have been able to identify it, said Ian Lipkin, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University who worked to contain SARS back in 2003. The prompt identification of the new strain allowed other countries to develop tests for the virus early on that should help contain the outbreak, said Peter Daszak, the president of non-profit EcoHealth Alliance, which researches emerging infectious diseases.\nExperts have also praised China for being transparent about the outbreak -- something the country was criticized for last time. Many are also impressed with China's unprecedented decision this week to stop transport to and from Wuhan during the country's biggest holiday. \"SARS was a huge embarrassment to China, and that's been driving a lot of the openness and transparency around this outbreak,\" Daszak said.\nThere are other things, too, that should make this outbreak easier to contain than SARS 17 years ago.\nChina and other Asian countries have stepped up their ability to respond to pandemics. Chinese residents are also more aware of how to protect themselves from the spread of disease, Lipkin said. Face masks are now mandatory in Wuhan, but before that, online sales surged, China Daily reported. That's also true in Hong Kong. For almost eight months, face masks have been closely associated with the ongoing pro-democracy protest movement. But over the past few weeks, more and more people have been wearing surgical masks in public -- for health reasons. For many, SARS taught them how to respond to the risk of disease.\nSurgical masks are now ubiquitous on the subway, and Hong Kong is facing a serious shortage of face masks, according to Horace Lau, the vice president of Hong Kong's General Chamber of Pharmacy.\nGrace said she started wearing a mask weeks ago.\n\"Since SARS took place in 2003, people in Hong Kong are more conscious about health and how to protect themselves,\" she said. What hasn't changed\nBut while China has undoubtedly been more communicative about the Wuhan coronavirus, there's still lingering distrust.\nIn 2003, then 15-year-old Li didn't think to question the authorities. Now, as an academic living outside mainland China's censorship, Li believes the Chinese government doesn't trust its people to handle the full truth.\n\"(It's this) sort of idea of 'we have to control the scale of the panic instead of the scale of disease,\" he said. \"I can only hope that ... they can act better and they can respond quickly instead of keeping people in the dark.\"\nOn Wednesday, a senior US State Department official said the US was concerned about the Chinese government's transparency. \"I do believe that the concern you see both inside China and internationally is a reflection of what we've seen in the past,\" the official said. \"That reluctance to respond in a rapid manner doesn't give the global community a secure feeling for this being managed inside China.\"\nHowever, on Friday President Donald Trump said on Twitter that China \"had been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus\" and thanked Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\"The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!\" Trump tweeted.\nLast weekend, Imperial College London found that an estimated 1,723 people were likely to have been infected by the virus by January 12, significantly more than the 45 confirmed cases around the time the study was released. On Monday, Chinese authorities reported that the number of cases had tripled over the weekend to 218.\nThose figures worried some people, but Daszak points out that there are always going to be more people infected than we know about -- not everyone's symptoms are serious enough for them to seek medical attention. Lipkin agrees, saying that authorities are likely being cautious about reporting numbers as it is winter -- a season when people often get flu and pneumonia anyway. Online, numerous people claim to have been turned away from Wuhan's hospitals. Although CNN has not been able to verify individual claims, Wuhan's health authority acknowledged in a statement that local hospitals were overwhelmed. Officials said the situation would improve as more medical facilities were set aside for the detection and treatment of the virus. According to state media reports, Wuhan plans to build a new hospital in six days.\nThere's also more to be done to address a major issue: live animal markets.\nThe coronavirus that caused SARS was traced to the civet cat, a wild animal considered a delicacy in parts of south China. After the outbreak in 2003, China banned the slaughter and consumption of civet cats.\nThis time around, it's believed the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak started in the now-shuttered Wuhan Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market, where a number of wild animals were for sale, including raccoon dogs and snakes. Experts believe that the coronavirus was carried by animals -- possibly snakes -- and then spread to humans. Although China bans the trafficking of some wild animals, it is still widely seen as the world's largest market for illicit wildlife products. Experts say markets that sell wild animals need to be banned.\n\"It places the whole world at risk. And I don't think we can allow these to continue. The risk is just too great,\" Lipkin said.\nDaszak added that countries need to take more preventative measures to stop pandemics.\n\"We should treat pandemics a bit like smoking or heart disease,\" he said. \"We spend billions of dollars once they emerge to control an outbreak, but we should also start spending money before they emerge to stop them spilling over to people.\"\nIs this SARS all over again?\nThere's reason to think that the current coronavirus outbreak won't have the same impact as SARS did in 2003.\nFor now, the virus doesn't seem as deadly. As of Thursday, Daszak estimated that it had a 3.5% mortality rate -- the WHO estimates that SARS had a fatality ratio of 14% to 15%.\nThis time around, we know what the disease is, and there are potential vaccines that can be trialed, Daszak said. Health authorities are also better prepared, says Hung, who doesn't think that this outbreak will be as bad as SARS.\nBut authorities also face new difficulties. This outbreak coincides with the Lunar New Year, and in the past 17 years, China has seen a dramatic increase in international and domestic travel. China's expansive trade network means the virus could spread to places like Africa, where testing might not be so intensive, Daszak said. Even in more developed countries, identifying people who were potentially infected still largely depends on them self-reporting their symptoms -- something some people just won't do.\nAt the moment, the disease hasn't become a super-spreader like SARS. If a disease is a super-spreader, it means that one person infects many people. There has been one report of a single patient infecting 14 health care workers, but no other similar cases have been reported.\nBut if the virus evolves to become a super-spreader, Daszak said that would \"basically be a repeat of SARS.\"\n\"It's beginning to look more and more like SARS every day,\" Daszak said, adding that the decision to shut down Wuhan suggested the authorities know something about the way the disease spreads that isn't good news.\nWhether this epidemic turns into SARS or not depends on how the disease evolves -- and how well public health authorities manage to contain it, he said.\n\"Right now, we are on the cusp of what could be a repeat of the SARS pandemic.\"",

Among the confirmed cases is a man aged in his 30s who has been diagnosed as a disease carrier without symptoms.\n\nAt least two people with the coronavirus in Japan have no travel history to Wuhan. One, a man in his 60s, is a bus driver who drove tour groups from Wuhan for nine days before getting ill. His is the first case of suspected human-to-human transmission in Japan.\n\nA third plane carrying Japanese evacuees from Wuhan arrived in Tokyo on Friday.\n\n\nNotably, the Japanese flights also carried medical supplies for the Chinese government.

He was admitted to hospital in Kathmandu on January 13, but was subsequently released on January 17 after his condition improved.\n\n\nThe Health Ministry said people in close contact with the patient have been identified and are being monitored.\n\nPhilippines (at least 2 cases, 1 death)\n\nThe Philippines reported its first coronavirus fatality on Sunday -- the first death from the virus outside of mainland China.\n\nThe patient was a 44-year-old Chinese man who flew in from Wuhan in January, and who died on Saturday. He is the partner of a 38-year-old Chinese woman who was traveling with him, and who was the first confirmed case reported in the Philippines.\n\nEarlier, the Department of Health stressed it is \"on top of the evolving situation\" but urged the public to wear surgical masks and avoid crowded places if they are experiencing symptoms, such as coughing and a fever.\n\nRussia (at least 2 cases)\n\n\nRussia has identified its first two cases, both Chinese citizens, Russia's TASS news agency reported, citing Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova.\n\nOne patient is being treated in the Zabaikalsky region, which borders China, with the second case detected in the Tyumen region in Western Siberia, which borders Kazakhstan, TASS reports.\n\nAccording to Golikova, Russia will begin evacuating its citizens from the Chinese provinces of Wuhan and Hubei, where there are 300 and 341 Russians respectively.\n\n\nSingapore (at least 24 cases)\n\nThe current number of confirmed cases in the country stands at 24.\n\nThe health ministry previously advised citizens to \"defer all travel to Hubei province and all non-essential travel to mainland China.\"\n\nMinister of trade and industry Chan Chun Sing said at a news conference the government will distribute four masks each to 1.3 million households starting Saturday. He added that the country has \"sufficient masks\" if they manage the supply appropriately.\n\nThe health ministry earlier urged employers to implement flexible work arrangements, such as working from home or telecommuting, for employees who have been to China in the past 14 days.\n\nSouth Korea (at least 16 cases)\n\nSouth Korea has confirmed a 16th case of the Wuhan coronavirus, according to Kim Gang-lip, vice minister of Health and Welfare.\n\nAccording to government estimates, there are about 700 South Koreans in Wuhan who registered to return to South Korea. The South Korean government initially planned to send two charter flights but only one flight has so far been approved by the Chinese government.\n\nSouth Korea is sending $5 million of emergency humanitarian aid to China, the South Korean Foreign Affairs Ministry announced on Thursday.\n\nSpain (at least 1 case)\n\nSpain confirmed its first case Friday, according to a statement from the Health Minister's Office. The statement said the patient is currently under observation at a hospital in La Gomera, a small island that is part of the Canary Islands.\n\nThe patient is part of a group of five people that health officials on the island say are \"under observation\" after being in contact with a person in Germany who has been diagnosed with the virus, the release stated.\n\nSri Lanka (at least 1 case)\n\nThere is one case of the Wuhan coronavirus in Sri Lanka.\n\nA statement from the health ministry assured residents that local hospitals were prepared to handle any further outbreak. The government is contacting people who may have come into contact with the single case to detect potential contagion.\n\nSweden (at least 1 case)\n\nSweden on Friday confirmed its first case, a woman in Jonkoping county who had visited Wuhan.\n\nWhen the woman landed in Sweden on January 24, she was free of symptoms of the infection, but later developed a cough and contacted a local hospital, Sweden's Public Health Authority said in a statement. She was isolated in the hospital's infection clinic, but is not seriously ill.\n\nTaiwan (at least 10 cases)\n\nTaiwan's Centre for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed its 10th case on Friday.\n\nThe CDC says that Taiwan's latest case, a man in his 40s, is the husband of the ninth confirmed case. He returned to Taiwan from Wuhan on January 12 and developed symptoms of upper respiratory infection on January 21.\n\nAll residents of Hubei province are banned from entering the self-governing island. Chinese students from other provinces will also be denied entry for two months. The export of face masks is also temporarily suspended to ensure stable supply.\n\nThailand (at least 25 cases)\n\nThai health officials have confirmed six new cases of the Wuhan coronavirus bringing the countrywide total to 25.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference on Tuesday, the Director General for the Disease Control Department, Dr. Suwannachai Wattanayingcharoen, said that four of the new cases are Thai nationals and the additional two are Chinese nationals. Two of the Thai nationals are a married couple who recently traveled to Japan and the other two Thais are \"hired car drivers\" who have transported Chinese passengers.\n\nFive out of the six cases are in stable condition, but the sixth case -- who is 70 years old and also suffers from tuberculosis -- is in critical condition according to Dr. Wattanayingcharoen.\n\nThai airports are now screening all Chinese visitors for symptoms. Thai citizens are also being asked to report anyone who seems to have fallen ill after recently traveling from China.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates (at least 5 cases)\n\nA new case of coronavirus has been reported in the UAE, making that the fifth case in the country, the Ministry of Health and Prevention announced on Saturday.\n\nThe patient, who arrived from Wuhan, is \"stable and under medical care,\" the ministry said in a statement, adding there is \"no cause for concern\" for the public.\n\nUnited Kingdom (at least 2 cases)\n\nThe UK has confirmed its first two cases in the northwest of England, according to a statement Friday by the chief medical officer for England.\n\n\"We can confirm that two patients in England, who are members of the same family, have tested positive for coronavirus. The patients are receiving specialist NHS (National Health Service) care, and we are using tried and tested infection control procedures to prevent further spread of the virus,\" Chris Whitty said.\n\n\"The NHS is extremely well-prepared and used to managing infections and we are already working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients had, to prevent further spread.\n\n\"We have been preparing for UK cases of novel coronavirus and we have robust infection control measures in place to respond immediately. We are continuing to work closely with the World Health Organization and the international community as the outbreak in China develops to ensure we are ready for all eventualities.\"\n\nUnited States (at least 11 cases)\n\nThere are now 11 cases of the novel coronavirus in the United States.\n\nTwo cases have been confirmed in San Benito County, California according to a statement provided by San Benito County Public Health Services.\n\nThe confirmed cases in San Benito County are related -- the individuals are husband and wife, both 57 years of age, according to the statement. The husband recently traveled from Wuhan, China, and the wife did not -- therefore, there has been person-to-person transmission.\n\nSix confirmed cases are in California, one in Massachusetts, one in Washington state, one in Arizona, and two in Illinois.\n\nThe State Department is telling US citizens not to travel to China amid the outbreak. In an advisory posted on the State Department website Friday, the agency elevated its travel warning to \"Do Not Travel\" and warned of possible \"travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice.\"\n\nThe advisory said US citizens currently in China should consider leaving using commercial means.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday confirmed that 195 passengers who have been evacuated from Wuhan arrived at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County, California, Wednesday. None of the passengers show signs of sickness, CDC officials said during a news conference Wednesday afternoon, but they will remain under a voluntary quarantine at the air base.\n\nVietnam (at least 8 cases)\n\nVietnam has confirmed an additional case of the Wuhan coronavirus in the province of Vinh Phuc, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to eight.\n\nThe latest case involves a Vietnamese woman who returned to Vietnam from Wuhan on January 17, according to state broadcaster VTV. The patient then had her samples taken for testing by the Ministry of Health on January 31. The Ministry of Health confirmed on Monday that she tested positive for the Wuhan coronavirus.",

            "HeadLine": "Will the new coronavirus burn out like SARS ... or is it here to stay?",
            "Text": "(CNN)Nearly two decades after he was treated, former severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patient Alex Lam is still haunted by his experience.\n\n\"(It is) painful hearing the news again. SARS is coming back, the deadly virus is coming back,\" he said. SARS, of course, has not returned, but a new type of deadly virus from the same family is sweeping China, opening old wounds for some.\nIn 2003, SARS infected more than 8,000 people, and killed 774. Asia was hardest hit, with Hong Kong recording almost 300 deaths. Lam was treated in an isolation ward for three weeks, and considered one of the lucky ones because he was discharged with no further complications.\n\"I was put in a big room with many other patients,\" he recalled. \"I heard some coughing at night, crying, and that's really sad.\" The novel coronavirus, which has now spread to at least 27 territories outside mainland China, is already bigger in numbers -- at least 28,000 people have been infected worldwide and more than 560 have died. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, prompting countries to take unprecedented measures.\nJohn Nicholls, clinical professor of pathology at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), said the SARS outbreak was brought to an end in July 2003 by good hygiene practices -- such as frequent hand-washing -- and environmental factors such as high temperature and humidity in the summer months.\n\"That will be the same for this one,\" he said. \"My feeling is that this is just going to be like SARS and the world is going to get basically a very bad cold for about five months.\" Containment\nTo stop the virus spreading further, China has ordered a lockdown on the movement of millions of people, which has seen flights, trains and buses canceled in all major cities of Hubei province, where the coronavirus was first reported. School in Hong Kong and Macao -- semi-autonomous Chinese cities that operate their own education systems -- is suspended until at least March.\nSome countries, such as South Korea and the Philippines, have closed their borders to visitors arriving from mainland China. Others have also issued travel warnings and evacuated citizens in Wuhan.\nDespite the drastic measures, some virology experts believe containing the current outbreak might prove to be more difficult than it was to stem SARS. Nicholls said one problem could be that the new virus appeared to have greater transmissibility than SARS, due the possibility that cases can be transmitted by asymptomatic patients.\nThe WHO, however, has said that \"the main driver of transmission ... is symptomatic cases.\" The organization said that it was \"aware of possible transmission\" from asymptomatic individuals in a few instances but believed this to be rare and not a major player in the spread of the virus.\nMeanwhile, Gilead Sciences, a biopharmaceutical firm with an experimental drug called remdesivir that is used to treat the Ebola virus, is working with Chinese health authorities to see if the medication can combat the symptoms of coronavirus.\nUnderstanding the virus\nIn January, Nicholls and his team became the first scientists outside mainland China to reproduce the virus in a laboratory. They have since been studying it to understand how the coronavirus interacts with human tissue around the body, and evaluate the test that diagnoses patients.\nMalik Peiris, a public health virologist at HKU who advises the WHO, said one optimistic sign was that the novel coronavirus appeared to have a lower fatality rate than SARS. On Tuesday, China's National Health Commission said the death rate was 2.1% nationwide, while SARS had a global ratio of 9.6%, according to the WHO. \"The case fatality rate doesn't count the milder cases that don't come to medical attention -- and there does seem to be quite a number of those,\" Peiris said. \"Hopefully, the severity of the disease is much lower than what we believe or what is apparent at the moment, and so the overall outcome may not be as dire as what some people think at this point in time.\"\nOther medical scholars have given different predictions on how long the outbreak may last.\nZhong Nanshan, one of China's leading respiratory experts and a hero of the 2003 fight against SARS, said he expected the virus to peak as quickly as the coming weekend.\nGabriel Leung, HKU's chair professor of public health medicine, was less optimistic and estimated the number of cases to peak around mid-April or mid-May.\nThe new normal?\nAnother scenario is that the new coronavirus could become a common global illness, like influenza. That outcome would not be without precedent. H1N1 -- a strain of flu responsible for the 2009 flu pandemic has now become a seasonal virus. \"The common cold is caused by two different types of coronaviruses,\" Peiris said.\nFor Lam, the former SARS patient, that scenario would be a failure. He is now the head of Hong Kong SARS Mutual Help Association -- a group of SARS survivors which is calling on the Hong Kong government to take tougher measures to end the outbreak.\n\"We hope that the government can do something more drastic ... because most parts of China are considered high risk,\" he said.\nLam also called for unity.\n\"To fight against contagious disease, we must stand together. We must not panic,\" he added. \"We need to think positive, because one day, the disease will go away.\"",

            "HeadLine": "SARS cost global airlines $7 billion. The coronavirus outbreak will likely be much worse",
            "Text": "Hong Kong (CNN Business)The global airline industry is facing huge financial losses as a growing number of carriers cancel flights to China because of the coronavirus outbreak. The hit will very likely be worse than the damage wrought by the 2003 SARS epidemic.\n\nThe outbreak of the disease has already killed 492 people worldwide, mostly in China, and infected more than 24,500 people across 25 countries.\nIn response, more than a dozen major airlines have canceled flights to and from mainland China. Several countries have also banned entry to foreigners who have traveled to China, while others have told their citizens not to travel there, or to leave if they can. The last time the aviation industry faced this kind of crisis was back in 2003, when the SARS outbreak cost Asia Pacific carriers $6 billion in revenue, according to the International Air Transport Authority (IATA). North American airlines lost $1 billion, while European carriers largely escaped unscathed, analysts say. It took nine months before international passenger traffic returned to normal, IATA said.\n\nThe coronavirus will \"definitely\" surpass that $7 billion SARS hit, said Ivan Su, an analyst with financial services firm Morningstar.\nThe global aviation industry, which generated $838 billion in revenue last year, will lose more money this time around for several reasons: The number of Chinese air travelers has ballooned since 2003. Chinese carriers, and the industry as a whole, are bigger now than before. And flight suspensions and travel advisories could last longer than they did during SARS, which would weigh on international airlines.\nA massive aviation market\nAround 660 million Chinese passengers traveled by air in 2019 \u2014 more than seven times as many as in 2003, according to state news agency Xinhua and Fitch Ratings. The vast majority of those trips are for domestic travel. The boom in China far outpaced the global increase in passenger numbers, which grew from 1.7 billion in 2003 to 4.2 billion in 2018, according to the World Bank.\nWhen SARS hit, global passenger traffic fell by 18.5% in April 2003 compared to a year earlier, with a drop of almost 45% in Asia-Pacific, Fitch ratings agency said in a report lat week.\nThis time around, the drop could be far worse. The coronavirus outbreak hit just as China was preparing for the Lunar New Year, its most significant holiday. Millions of Chinese scrapped travel plans as Beijing took the extraordinary step of placing entire cities on lockdown to contain the virus. Officials said last month that air travel on the first day of the holiday period fell more than 41% compared to a year ago. Lunar New Year aside, China has also become much more important to the global aviation industry.\nIt is currently the world's second-largest civil aviation market, behind the United States, hauling in 1.06 trillion yuan ($151 billion) in revenue last year, according to Xinhua.\nMajor Chinese carriers Air China (AIRYY), China Southern (ZNH) and China Eastern (CEA) \"have grown easily five to sixfold compared to 2003, when they were just very, very small compared to the rest of international carriers,\" said Shukor Yusof, head of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics in Malaysia.\nChina Southern, the country's biggest airline, reported 43.7 billion yuan ($6.2 billion) in revenue in the third quarter last year. By comparison, Delta (DAL) \u2014 the top US carrier \u2014 reported revenue of $12.6 billion for the same period.\nRestrictions and cancellations\nExtensive travel restrictions will also weigh on international carriers.\n\"Airlines are more impacted today because China is the world's economic engine,\" Yusof said, adding that the sweeping flight cancellations made by American Airlines (AAL), Air Canada (ACDVF), British Airways and others are \"unprecedented.\"\n\"This [outbreak] should be worse as travel bans have started early and it seems they will remain in force for a long period of time,\" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis.\nDuring SARS, the World Health Organization issued its first emergency travel advisory about the illness in mid-March of 2003, nearly five months after the first reported cases began to emerge. The agency lifted travel advisories against Hong Kong and Beijing in May and June of that year respectively, once the outbreak had been contained in those hubs.

            "HeadLine": "CDC tells states to prepare for COVID-19 vaccine by late October or early November",
            "Text": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has notified public health officials in all 50 states and five large cities to prepare to distribute a coronavirus vaccine to health care workers and other high-risk groups as soon as late October or early November.\n\nThe new CDC guidance is the latest sign of an accelerating race for a vaccine to ease a pandemic that has killed more than 184,000 Americans. The documents were sent out on the same day that President Donald Trump told the nation in his speech to the Republican National Convention that a vaccine might arrive before the end of the year. Over the past week, both Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s top infectious disease expert, and Dr. Stephen Hahn, who heads the Food and Drug Administration, have said in interviews with news organizations that a vaccine may be available for certain groups before clinical trials have been completed, if the data is overwhelmingly positive.\n\nPublic health experts agree that agencies at all levels of government should urgently prepare for what will eventually be a vast, complex effort to vaccinate hundreds of millions of Americans. But the possibility of a rollout in late October or early November has heightened concerns that the Trump administration is seeking to rush the distribution of a vaccine \u2014 or simply to hype that one is possible \u2014 before Election Day on Nov. 3. For an administration that has struggled with the logistical challenges of containing the coronavirus, the distribution of millions of vaccines that must be stored in subzero temperatures and provided first to high-risk groups through America\u2019s flawed, fragmented health care system would be a daunting challenge. Even the CDC\u2019s guidance acknowledged that its plan was hypothetical and based on the need to immediately begin organizing the gigantic effort that would be required if the FDA were to allow the use of a vaccine or two this year.\n\nThe CDC plans lay out technical specifications for two candidates described as Vaccine A and Vaccine B, including requirements for shipping, mixing, storage and administration. The details seem to match the products developed by Pfizer and Moderna, which are the furthest along in late-stage clinical trials. On Aug. 20, Pfizer said it was \u201con track\u201d for seeking government review \u201cas early as October 2020.\u201d \u201cThis timeline of the initial deployment at the end of October is deeply worrisome for the politicization of public health and the potential safety ramifications,\u201d said Saskia Popescu, an infection prevention epidemiologist based in Arizona. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to see this as a push for a preelection vaccine.\u201d\n\nThree documents were sent to public health officials in all states and territories as well as officials in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Houston and San Antonio on Aug. 27. They outlined detailed scenarios for distributing two unidentified vaccine candidates, each requiring two doses a few weeks apart, at hospitals, mobile clinics and other facilities offering easy access to the first targeted recipients.\n\nThe guidance noted that health care professionals, including long-term care employees, would be among the first to receive the product, along with other essential workers and national security employees. People 65 or older, as well as Native Americans and those who are from \u201cracial and ethnic minority populations,\u201d or incarcerated \u2014 all communities known to be at greater risk of contracting the virus and experiencing severe disease \u2014 were also prioritized in the documents.\n\nThat\u2019s a positive development, \u201cso it doesn\u2019t just all wind up in high-income, affluent suburbs,\u201d said Dr. Cedric Dark, an emergency medicine physician at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.\n\nThe CDC noted in its guidance that \u201climited COVID-19 vaccine doses may be available by early November 2020.\u201d The documents were dispatched the same day that Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the CDC, sent a letter to governors asking them to prepare vaccine distribution sites by Nov. 1, as McClatchy reported.\n\nThe agency also said its plans were as yet hypothetical, noting, \u201cThe COVID-19 vaccine landscape is evolving and uncertain, and these scenarios may evolve as more information is available.\u201d A CDC spokeswoman confirmed that the documents were sent but declined to comment further.\n\nMany of the details listed for the two vaccines \u2014 including required storage temperature, the number of days needed between doses, and the type of medical center that can accommodate the product\u2019s storage \u2014 match what Pfizer and Moderna have said about their products, which are based on so-called mRNA technology. Neither company responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe scenarios, which assume that the two vaccines will demonstrate sufficient safety and effectiveness for an emergency authorization from the FDA by the end of October, noted that Vaccine A, which seems to match Pfizer\u2019s, would have about 2 million doses ready within this time frame, and that Vaccine B, whose description matches Moderna\u2019s, would have about 1 million doses ready, with tens of millions of doses of each vaccine ready by the end of the year. Although it\u2019s possible that some promising preliminary data may emerge by the end of October, experts are skeptical.\n\n\u201cThe timeline that\u2019s reported seems a bit ambitious to me,\u201d Dark said. \u201cOctober\u2019s like 30 days away.\u201d\n\nTrials that test a vaccine\u2019s effectiveness can take years to yield reliable results. It\u2019s possible to draw conclusions sooner \u201cif there is an overwhelming effect\u201d in which vaccinated people appear to be far better protected from disease, said Padmini Pillai, a vaccine researcher and immunologist at MIT.\n\nBut there can be significant risks in approving a vaccine for broad use in the public before Phase 3 clinical trials involving tens of thousand of participants are completed. Rare but dangerous side effects may only surface over time, after such large numbers of people have received the vaccine.\n\nAnd data gathered early in a trial might not hold true months down the line. Researchers also need time to test large numbers of people from a variety of backgrounds to determine how well the vaccine works in different populations \u2014 including the vulnerable communities identified in the guidelines.\n\nShould any of these snags occur, Pillai said, \u201call of this together could diminish public trust in the vaccine.\u201d\n\nJames Blumenstock, senior vice president of pandemic response and recovery at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, confirmed that the trio of CDC documents were sent to all state and territorial health departments last week.\n\n\u201cIt is now the time to enhance organizational structure and involve all partners in this planning process going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nLisa Stromme, a spokeswoman for the Washington State Department of Health, said that her state\u2019s health officials were still at \u201ca very early stage in a planning process\u201d but were already working toward developing infrastructure \u201cthat would accommodate\u201d the assumptions laid out by the CDC.\n\nThe CDC documents said that public health administrators should review lessons learned from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic vaccination campaign, which did not have enough doses at the beginning to meet demand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to have a plan out for hospitals and health care systems to prepare\u201d for a potential rollout, said Dr. Taison Bell, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of Virginia. But Bell added that he was concerned that the timeline outlined in the documents \u201cis incredibly ambitious and makes me worry that the administration will prioritize this arbitrary deadline rather than maintaining diligence with following the science.\u201d The technical comparison of Vaccine A and Vaccine B has some echoes of what was discussed at an Aug. 26 meeting of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. At the meeting, Dr. Kathleen Dooling, a CDC medical officer, laid out three scenarios: Vaccine A, or the Pfizer vaccine, is approved; Vaccine B, the Moderna vaccine, is approved, or both. The requirement that Pfizer\u2019s vaccine be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius would mean that it couldn\u2019t be administered at most small sites, she noted. The CDC documents note that orders of Vaccine A would go \u201cto large administration sites only.\u201d The Moderna vaccine requires storage at minus 20 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe CDC documents said that the vaccine would be free to patients, but that providers might not be reimbursed for administrative costs if the vaccine was given an emergency authorization, rather than a standard approval.\n\nExperts worry that the process is unlikely to go off without a hitch, given the last-minute scramble and the mixed messaging so far.\n\n\u201cI think distribution is going to be very tricky for the vaccine, particularly if there is a cold storage requirement,\u201d Bell said.\n\nThere are also likely to be challenges administering both doses of the proposed vaccines, which must be given weeks apart, Dark said. \u201cHow are you going to make sure people get both?\u201d",

            "Text": "In planning documents sent last week to public health agencies around the country, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention described preparations for two coronavirus vaccines they refer to simply as Vaccine A and Vaccine B. The technical details of the vaccines, including the time between doses and their storage temperatures, match well with the two vaccines furthest along in clinical tests in the United States, made by Moderna and Pfizer.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about how the vaccines work, how they\u2019re being tested and how they might be rolled out to the public \u2014 if, and it\u2019s still a big if, they are proven to work. How do these vaccines work?\n\nVaccines can take many different forms. The most common in use today contain inactivated viruses, weakened live viruses or pieces of proteins. Moderna and Pfizer are testing a new kind of vaccine that has never before been approved for use by people. It contains genetic molecules called messenger RNA. The messenger RNA is injected into muscle cells, which treat it like instructions for building a protein \u2014 a protein found on the surface of the coronavirus. If all goes well, the proteins stimulate the immune system and result in long-lasting protection against the virus. What do we know about how well these vaccines work?\n\nBoth vaccines have gone through extensive early tests, but we still don\u2019t know for sure if they\u2019re safe and effective. Once vaccines are designed, they go through four stages of testing. In the preclinical stage, researchers test them on animals. For COVID-19, these animals include hamsters and genetically modified mice, both of which can experience some of the same symptoms as humans.\n\nIf these tests yield promising results, then the vaccines go into three phases of clinical trials in people.\n\nIn Phase 1, doctors give the vaccine to a small number of volunteers. They keep an eye on them to make sure they don\u2019t have any immediate negative reactions. It\u2019s not uncommon for people to feel achiness in their muscles or even a mild fever, but these mild symptoms typically don\u2019t last long.\n\nIn Phase 2 trials, scientists give the vaccine to hundreds of people split into groups, like children and older adults, to determine whether the vaccine acts differently in them. In both Phases 1 and 2, researchers analyze the blood of volunteers to see if their immune systems are learning to fight the virus with antibodies and immune cells that can kill infected cells.\n\nFinally, in Phase 3 trials, scientists give the vaccine to tens of thousands of people and a placebo to tens of thousands of others.\n\nModerna and Pfizer are currently testing their candidates in Phase 3 trials. In their earlier human studies, neither vaccine produced serious side effects. Both vaccines provoked people\u2019s immune systems to make antibodies that can neutralize the coronavirus.\n\nThat\u2019s encouraging. But that alone does not reveal whether a vaccine works or not.\n\nWhy is a Phase 3 trial important?\n\nOnly a Phase 3 trial can establish whether a vaccine is safe and effective enough to be approved for widespread use.\n\nIn such a trial, volunteers are randomly assigned to receive either the vaccine or the placebo. They don\u2019t know which one they are given nor do their doctors. By \u201cblinding\u201d the trial, researchers ensure that no bias creeps into the study.\n\nA Phase 3 trial collects data about the symptoms volunteers experience after their injection and whether they become infected with the coronavirus. After \u201cunblinding\u201d the data, researchers compare the rates of infection and adverse side effects between people who receive the vaccine and those who receive the placebo.\n\nIf significantly more people get COVID-19 on the placebo than the vaccine, that is evidence that the vaccine is effective. The Food and Drug Administration has indicated that vaccine makers should aim for 50% protection in order to be considered effective.\n\nIf significantly more people who receive the vaccine suffer serious side effects, that may indicate that the vaccine isn\u2019t safe \u2014 or may be safe only for certain groups, like people under age 65.\n\nCould a vaccine be approved before clinical trials are completed?\n\nIn recent days, some federal health officials have said a vaccine could be made available to at least some groups before clinical trials have been completed. An independent body called a Data and Safety Monitoring Board is charged with checking in on clinical trials at certain points to ensure there are no serious safety issues. If the vaccine is harming participants, the trial may be ended early. But if it appeared to be working incredibly well \u2014 a scenario that the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, floated in an interview with Kaiser Health News this week \u2014 the board could also decide it would no longer be ethical to continue giving some participants a placebo and could end the trial early.\n\nWhat have companies said about when their vaccines may be ready?\n\nCompanies have given varying estimates. Pfizer recently said it was \u201con track\u201d for seeking government review \u201cas early as October 2020.\u201d Moderna has said it expects to complete enrollment in its Phase 3 trial in September but has not provided an estimate about when the vaccine might be ready for the public.\n\nFederal officials said in May that the first doses of a vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca, in partnership with the University of Oxford, could be delivered by October. But AstraZeneca, which recently began Phase 3 trials of the vaccine in the United States, is now saying it could supply the first doses of the vaccine in the United States by the end of 2020.\n\nIn a recent statement, Pascal Soriot, chief executive of AstraZeneca, said the company was \u201cputting science and the interest of society at the heart of our work,\u201d adding, \u201cwe are moving quickly but without cutting corners.\u201d\n\nHow would a vaccine reach the public?\n\nThe pandemic has prompted a drastic change in how vaccines are developed. Normally, vaccine makers would wait for clinical trials to yield definitive results before moving forward with plans to manufacture a vaccine. This time, many manufacturers have begun preparing in advance for production, getting money from governments to buffer the risk.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s planning documents give an indication of the extraordinary complexity of distributing vaccines to hundreds of millions of people in a country with a fragmented health care system. Past experiences serve as a warning about how this undertaking can go awry.\n\nIn March 2009, a pandemic strain of influenza known as H1N1 emerged, raising the prospect that huge numbers of people might die. Scientists worked hard to create and test a vaccine for the new flu strain as fast as possible. But large deliveries of the vaccine didn\u2019t start until December, and only 24% of Americans received it by April 2010. Fortunately, the new flu strain turned out to be much milder than expected.\n\nThat\u2019s not the case with COVID-19. So far, over 25.7 million people have been infected worldwide, and 857,920 have died. With the prospect of many more infections ahead, the rapid deployment of a safe and effective vaccine is all the more urgent.\n\nWhen might the first vaccines be distributed?\n\nThe CDC told public health agencies last week that limited doses of a vaccine may be available beginning in late October or November, although that would only be if a vaccine is shown to be safe and effective. According to the documents the agency sent to the public health offices, 2 million doses of what the CDC labeled Vaccine A \u2014 most likely the Pfizer vaccine \u2014 may be available by the end of October, with 10 million to 20 million doses possibly available by November, and 20 million to 30 million by the end of December.\n\nThe CDC said the other potential vaccine, Vaccine B \u2014 which matches the details of the Moderna vaccine \u2014 could have about 1 million doses available by October, 10 million by November and 15 million by December. Each of the vaccines would require two doses to be effective.\n\nPfizer and Moderna did not respond to questions about the CDC\u2019s recent guidelines.\n\nWho will get it first?\n\nIn the documents sent to public health agencies, the CDC said certain groups would have priority, beginning with health care workers, essential workers (like police officers or those who work in critical industries like food production), \u201cnational security populations,\u201d and workers and residents of long-term care facilities like nursing homes.\n\nThose priority groups include millions of people. At a meeting last week of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the CDC, an agency official presented a slide showing that in the United States, there are about 17 million to 20 million health care workers, 60 million to 80 million essential workers, and about 53 million people older than 65. On Wednesday, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine unveiled a 114-page plan, sponsored by the CDC and the National Institutes of Health, that proposed a complicated four-phase system for priority.\n\nWill these two COVID-19 vaccines be the only ones available?\n\nProbably not. Aside from Moderna and Pfizer, there are 34 other vaccines in clinical trials worldwide. There are over 90 more vaccines confirmed to be in active preclinical testing. Over the next year, 69 of them are slated to go into clinical trials.\n\nAmong all of these other vaccines, some may prove more potent than the first ones that are approved. Some may be better in particular for children or older people. Some may turn out to provide a valuable booster to immunity.\n\nModerna and Pfizer\u2019s vaccines also require a lot of care in their handling. For example, Moderna\u2019s vaccine requires storage at minus 20 degrees Celsius; Pfizer\u2019s has to stay at minus 70. Some of the other vaccines now being developed may be kept at much warmer temperatures, making them easier to distribute in places that don\u2019t have advanced medical facilities.",

            "Text": "Where did the 2009 H1N1 flu virus come from?\nThe 2009 H1N1 influenza virus (referred to as \u201cswine flu\u201d early on) was first detected in people in the United States in April 2009. This virus was originally referred to as \u201cswine flu\u201d because laboratory testing showed that its gene segments were similar to influenza viruses that were most recently identified in and known to circulate among pigs. CDC believes that this virus resulted from reassortment, a process through which two or more influenza viruses can swap genetic information by infecting a single human or animal host. When reassortment does occur, the virus that emerges will have some gene segments from each of the infecting parent viruses and may have different characteristics than either of the parental viruses, just as children may exhibit unique characteristics that are like both of their parents. In this case, the reassortment appears most likely to have occurred between influenza viruses circulating in North American pig herds and among Eurasian pig herds.  Reassortment of influenza viruses can result in abrupt, major changes in influenza viruses, also known as \u201cantigenic shift.\u201d When shift happens, most people have little or no protection against the new influenza virus that results. For more information, see \u201cHow the Flu Virus can Shift: Drift for Shift.\u201d\n\nWhy does CDC think this?\nThere are three primary reasons why experts from CDC and other public health research institutions around the world think 2009 H1N1 influenza resulted from reassortment of influenza viruses that occur naturally among pigs.\n\nReason One\nThe different gene segments of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus are traceable to influenza viruses found in pigs. All influenza viruses have eight genes. Six of the eight genes found within the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus are associated with influenza viruses that regularly cause illness in pigs in North America. The remaining two genes of the 2009 H1N1 flu virus are associated with influenza viruses that previously were only known to be circulating among pigs from Eurasia.1, 2 The mixing of live pigs from Eurasia and North America through international trade or other means could have created the circumstances necessary for influenza viruses from North American and Eurasian pigs to mix. In fact, a 2009 study in Nature demonstrated that reassortant influenza viruses with genes from North American and Eurasian pigs were found in samples collected from pigs in Hong Kong as early as 2004.2*\n\n*The reassortant influenza viruses found in Hong Kong from 2004 are different from the 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses that have caused human illness around the world today, but these viruses serve as an example of how reassortment can occur naturally among influenza viruses found in Eurasian and North American pigs.\n\nReason Two\nEvidence suggests that the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus has existed and evolved in nature for some time prior to being detected in humans. There are laboratory techniques available for looking at how and at what speed influenza viruses evolve and change. This is related to a concept known as \u201cmolecular evolution.\u201d  Evolution refers to small changes in influenza viruses that happen continually over time. Generally speaking, influenza viruses generate mutations by passing from one animal to another animal for several years and through virus replication in the animal host. These mutations are represented by changes in the nucleotides and amino acids found within influenza viruses. These small changes occur at a relatively stable rate in all influenza viruses. As a result, scientists can compare the number of mutations found within a new influenza virus with older, related influenza viruses to estimate the amount of time that it may have taken for one strain to evolve into a new strain of influenza virus.  Researchers at CDC used this molecular evolution method to determine that the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus likely evolved in nature \u2013 perhaps through circulation in an unknown animal host \u2013 for a number of years before being detected. At this time, CDC continues to monitor the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus for changes. Research so far suggests that the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus is changing at a normal rate as compared to other influenza viruses.\n\nReason Three\nThe 2009 H1N1 influenza virus does not have the adaptations that are typical of influenza viruses grown or created in laboratories. For example, the standard method of growing influenza virus in laboratories involves injecting the virus into fertilized chicken eggs. The 2009 H1N1 influenza virus lacks the properties associated with growth in eggs.  \n\nHave viruses similar to the 2009 H1N1 virus been seen before?\nPrior to the discovery of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, this particular combination of gene segments from North American and Eurasian swine had never been detected before in a single influenza virus and this new virus is different from the influenza viruses that normally circulate in North American and Eurasian pigs. It is not known when reassortment occurred to create the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus.  Testing of the virus suggests that this reassortment event may have occurred years prior to the first reports of 2009 H1N1 influenza infection in people.1, 2 Scientists call 2009 H1N1 influenza a \"quadruple reassortant\" virus, because although each separate gene segment of the virus has been found in pigs previously, the individual gene segments of the virus originated from humans, birds, North American pigs and Eurasian pigs.\n\nWhy does the 2009 H1N1 flu virus have genes from humans, birds, and from pigs on different continents?\nPigs can be infected by influenza viruses found in birds and other animals as well as people.  Therefore, pigs represent a mixing vessel in which influenza viruses from different species can swap genes. For example, in a setting where people and animals are in close contact, pigs can be infected by influenza viruses found in pigs, poultry or humans \u2013 sometimes at the same time. For at least 80 years, influenza viruses known as \u201cclassical swine H1N1\u201d viruses have circulated in North American pigs. However, in the late 1990s, a series of reassortment events occurred between influenza viruses found in pigs, humans and birds. As a result, swine influenza viruses with genes from humans, North American pigs and birds have existed in many parts of the world for around 10 years prior to 2009 H1N1 flu. Mixing of these \u201ctriple reassortant North American swine influenza viruses\u201d with Eurasian swine viruses likely resulted in the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus.\n\nWas the 2009 H1N1 flu virus created in a laboratory?\nThis is very unlikely. Each of the gene segments within the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus have been found in pigs for more than 10 years prior to the beginning of the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak.2  Pigs have long been considered a possible mixing vessel for influenza viruses that originate within pigs, birds and humans. In addition, a 2009 Nature study showed that reassortment between influenza viruses found in North American and Eurasia pigs had already occurred at least once naturally in the 5 years prior to the identification of 2009 H1N1 flu. Also, the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus does not have adaptations consistent with viruses grown in laboratories. For more information, see reasons 1, 2 and 3 above.\n\nHow often does reassortment of influenza viruses occur?\nWe know that reassortment occurs frequently in nature. Fortunately, reassortment rarely results in a virus with pandemic potential, though it has done so at least twice in the 20th century. The influenza viruses that caused the 1957 and 1968 pandemics contained a mixture of gene segments from human and avian influenza viruses.  What is clear from genetic analysis of the viruses that caused these past pandemics is that reassortment (gene swapping) occurred to produce novel influenza viruses that caused the pandemics.  In both of these cases, the new viruses that emerged showed major differences from the parent viruses.  However, not all viruses emerge directly from reassortment events. For example, the origins of the 1918 virus are not precisely known, but experts think it is likely that the 1918 virus may have resulted from a bird influenza virus directly infecting humans and pigs at about the same time without reassortment.\n\nWhat can be done to identify influenza viruses circulating in animals that have pandemic potential?\nThe emergence of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus in humans highlights the need for better surveillance of influenza viruses in pigs and other animals.  The mixing of influenza genes in pigs can result in the emergence of viruses with pandemic potential in humans. Improved surveillance of influenza in pigs and other animals may help to detect the emergence of influenza viruses with the potential to cause illness and spread among people, possibly resulting in a pandemic.  Early detection of such viruses can alert public health officials and aid in pandemic preparedness through the development of appropriate diagnostic tests and influenza vaccine candidate viruses, if necessary.",

            "Text": "Disease Characteristics\nWhen the novel H1N1 flu outbreak was first detected in mid-April 2009, CDC began working with states to collect, compile and analyze information regarding the novel H1N1 outbreak. On July 24, 2009 official reporting of individual cases of confirmed and probable novel H1N1 infection was discontinued. Below is a summary of information gathered during the first weeks of the outbreak. These key disease characteristics are thought to remain an accurate representation of novel H1N1 flu.\n\nHow many cases of novel H1N1 flu infection have been reported in the United States?\nWhen the novel H1N1 flu outbreak was first detected in mid-April 2009, CDC began working with states to collect, compile and analyze information regarding the novel H1N1 flu outbreak, including the numbers of confirmed and probable cases of disease. From April 15, 2009 to July 24, 2009, states reported a total of 43,771 confirmed and probable cases of novel influenza A (H1N1) infection. Of these cases reported, 5,011 people were hospitalized and 302 people died. On July 24, 2009, confirmed and probable case counts were discontinued. Aggregate national reports of hospitalizations and deaths will continue at this time.\n\nHow many people have been infected with novel H1N1 flu?\nA CDC model was developed to try to determine the true number of novel H1N1 flu cases in the United States. The model took the number of cases reported by states and adjusted the figure to account for known sources of underestimation (for example; not all people with novel H1N1 flu seek medical care, and not all people who seek medical care have specimens collected by their health care provider). Using this approach, it is estimated that more than one million people became ill with novel H1N1 flu between April and June 2009 in the United States. The details of this model and the modeling study will be submitted for publication in a peer reviewed journal.\n\nWhy did CDC discontinue reporting of individual cases?\nIndividual case counts were used in the early stages of the outbreak to track the spread of disease. As novel H1N1 flu became more widespread, individual case counts became an increasingly inaccurate representation of the true burden of disease. This is because many people likely became mildly ill with novel H1N1 flu and never sought treatment; many people may have sought and received treatment but were never officially tested or diagnosed; and as the outbreak intensified, in some cases, testing was limited to only hospitalized patients. That means that the official case count represented only a fraction of the true burden of novel H1N1 flu illness in the United States. CDC recognized early in the outbreak that once disease was widespread, it would be more valuable to transition to standard surveillance systems to monitor illness, hospitalizations and deaths. CDC discontinued official reporting of individual cases on July 24, 2009. For more information about how CDC is monitoring novel H1N1 flu, visit \u201cH1N1 Monitoring Q &A\u201d.\n\nWhat is the secondary attack rate of the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus in the household setting?\nThe secondary attack rate reflects the risk of someone being infected with a disease by an ill close contact (for example, a family member, classmate or co-worker). Epidemiologic field studies in several states found a secondary attack rate in household contacts for acute-respiratory-illness (ARI) was 18 % to 19% and 8% to 12% for influenza-like-illness (ILI). ARI is defined as two or more of the following four symptoms: fever, cough, sore throat, and rhinorrhea (runny nose). ILI is defined as fever and cough or sore throat. In general, these household secondary attack rates are slightly lower than what occurs in seasonal influenza. The use of antiviral medications (which can reduce viral shedding) to treat cases or prevent influenza in household contacts may have decreased secondary attack rates.\n\nWhat is the generation time of the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus?\nThe generation time is the doubling time, or the time required for the number of infections to double in size. Epidemiologic field studies of novel H1N1 flu infections in several states indicate that the generation time for acute respiratory illness (ARI) was 2.0-3.1 days and 2.4-3.1 days for influenza like illness (ILI).\n\nWhat information is there regarding community rates of influenza-like illness associated with the novel H1N1 flu outbreak?\nCommunity surveys and population-based telephone surveys in areas with focal outbreaks of novel H1N1 flu have reported influenza-like-illness affecting approximately 6% of the population in the areas surveyed. On June 10, 2009, the New York City Health DepartmentExternal Web Site Icon released preliminary findings from a household survey suggesting that 6.9% of New Yorkers may have experienced flu-like illness between May 1 and May 20, 2009. The results of these surveys are being submitted for publication in peer reviewed journals.\n\nHow have different age groups in the United States been impacted by novel H1N1 flu in terms of infection rates?\nWhen the novel H1N1 outbreak was first detected in mid-April 2009, CDC began working with states to collect, compile and analyze information regarding the novel H1N1 flu outbreak, including the numbers of confirmed and probable cases and the ages of these people. The information analyzed by CDC supports the conclusion that novel H1N1 flu has caused greater disease burden on people younger than 25 years of age than older people.\n\nGraph A (below) shows the estimated rate of novel H1N1 cases per 100,000 people reported to CDC in the United States by age group from April 15 to July 24, 2009. Over this time period, 43,771* probable and confirmed cases of novel H1N1 infection were reported to CDC. The number of reported cases per 100,000 population** was highest among people in the 5 years to 24 years of age group (26.7 per 100,000). This was followed by those in the 0 to 4 years of age group, whose case rate was 22.9 per 100,000 people. The rate declined further to 6.97 people per 100,000 in the 25 years to 49 years of age group. The rate was 3.9 per 100,000 people in the 50 years to 64 years of age group. At 1.3 people per 100,000, the novel H1N1 flu infection rate was lowest in people 65 years and older.\n\nThis epidemiological data supports laboratory serology studies that indicate that older people may have pre-existing immunity to the novel H1N1 flu virus. This age distribution is very different from what is normally seen for seasonal flu, where older people are more heavily impacted.\n\n*Of the total number of cases reported to CDC, 6,741cases were omitted from this analysis due to missing ages.\n**The denominator in these calculations is derived from national population census data, and is not adjusted for the actual geographic distribution of cases.  This thus reflects a national average.  Because only a fraction of persons with influenza symptoms are likely to have been tested for novel H1N1, these rate estimates are underestimation of the actual rates.  Ho How have different age groups been impacted by novel H1N1 flu in terms of hospitalization rates in the United States?\nWhen the novel H1N1 flu outbreak was first detected in mid-April 2009, CDC began working with states to collect, compile and analyze information regarding the novel H1N1 flu outbreak, including information on hospitalizations and the ages of people hospitalized with confirmed and probable novel H1N1 flu infection.\n\nGraph B (below) shows the estimated novel H1N1 flu hospitalization rate in the United States by age group from April 15 to July 24, 2009. These estimates are based on the 4,738* hospitalizations that were reported to CDC during this time period.   The reported hospitalization rate per 100,000** people was highest among children in the 0 to 4 years of age group. The hospitalization rate of children in the 0 to 4 age group with novel H1N1 flu illness was 4.5 children per 100,000. The next highest reported hospitalization rate was in the 5 to 24 years of age group, which had a hospitalization rate of 2.1 per 100,000 people. The hospitalization rate for people in the 25 to 49 years of age group was lowest at 1.1 per 100,000 people. The hospitalization rate for people 50 to 64 years of age was 1.2 per 100,000 people, and the hospitalization rate for people 65 years and older was 1.7 per 100,000.\n\nWhile people 65 years and older are much less likely to become ill with novel H1N1 flu, the increase in the hospitalization rate for people in this age groups indicates that if they do become sick, their risk of hospitalization is increased. This is not surprising given that people 65 and older are generally considered at higher risk of serious flu-related complications, including those requiring hospitalization, from seasonal flu illness.\n\n*Of the total population of hospitalizations (n=4,738) 273 cases were omitted from this analysis due to missing ages.\n\n**The denominator in these calculations is derived from national population census data and is not adjusted for the actual geographic distribution of cases.  This reflects a national average.  Because only a fraction of people with influenza symptoms are likely to have been tested for novel H1N1, these rate estimates are underestimation of the actual rates.  However, the relative difference in rates between age groups is what is most important about these data. How many patients hospitalized with novel H1N1 flu have had underlying medical conditions?\nCDC studied the hospital records of 268 patients hospitalized with novel H1N1 flu early on during the outbreak. The analysis found that the prevalence of selected underlying conditions was significantly higher among hospitalized novel H1N1 flu patients compared to the prevalence in the general U.S. populations, except for chronic renal disease and obesity.  For example, asthma occurs in 8% of the U.S. population, but 32% of hospitalized novel H1N1 flu patients had asthma. With seasonal flu, underlying medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, heart disease and pregnancy place people at greater risk of serious flu-related complications.(People may have reported one or more underlying conditions.)\n\nIs obesity considered an underlying medical condition placing people at higher risk of H1N1-related complications?\nObesity is not one of the medical conditions that have previously been recognized to place people at greater risk of serious seasonal flu-related complications; however, obesity has been noted as an underlying medical condition in some hospitalized novel H1N1 patients. In a subset of 268 patients hospitalized with novel H1N1 early on during the outbreak, the body mass index (BMI)* of 227 patients** was calculated. Obesity (defined as a BMI greater than or equal to 30-39.9) was noted in about 15% of these patients and morbid obesity (defined as BMI greater than or equal to 40) was noted in about 8% of these patients. Although the importance of obesity as a contributing factor to novel H1N1 complications is currently unknown, many obese persons have other known underlying diseases that put them at risk for flu complications.\n\nMore information about novel H1N1 and obesity is available in a July 10, 2009 Morbity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) Dispatch entitled \u201cIntensive-Care Patients With Severe Novel Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Infection --- Michigan, June 2009.\u201d A striking prevalence of obesity in the intensive care patients evaluated in this report was noted.\n*Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight.\n\n**BMI was not calculated for pregnant women and children younger than 2 years in this subset of 268 hospitalized patients.\n\nWhat symptoms did hospitalized patients have?\nThe symptoms of novel H1N1 flu virus in people are similar to the symptoms of seasonal flu, although vomiting and diarrhea has been reported more commonly with H1N1 flu infection than is typical for seasonal flu. CDC studied the hospital records of 268 patients hospitalized with novel H1N1 flu early on during the outbreak. In this early subset of cases with significant clinical data, fever (93%) and cough (83%) were the two most reported symptoms. This is not surprising since cough and fever were part of the case definition. Other symptoms were shortness of breath (54%), fatigue/weakness (40%), chills (37%) and myalgias (muscle soreness) (36%). (See Table below) Severe illnesses and death has occurred as a result of illness associated with this virus. How have different age groups been affected by novel H1N1 flu in terms of deaths?\nCDC studied the hospital records of 268 patients hospitalized with novel H1N1 flu early on during the outbreak. The number of deaths was highest among people 25 to 49 years of age (39%), followed by people 50 to 64 year of age (25%) and people 5 to 24 year of age (16%) This is a very different pattern from what is seen in seasonal influenza, where an estimated 90% of influenza-related deaths occur in people 65 years of age and older.

This season, there is a seasonal flu vaccine to protect against seasonal flu viruses and a 2009 H1N1 vaccine to protect against the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus (sometimes called \u201cswine flu\u201d).\n\nThis page contains information about the 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine.\n\nThere are two kinds of 2009 H1N1 vaccines being produced:\n\nA 2009 H1N1 \"flu shot\" \u2014 an inactivated vaccine (containing killed virus) that is given with a needle, usually in the arm. The indications for who can get the 2009 H1N1 flu shot are the same as for seasonal flu shots. The flu shot is approved for use in people 6 months of age and older, including healthy people, individuals with chronic medical conditions and pregnant women. The same manufacturers who produce seasonal flu shots are producing 2009 H1N1 flu shots for use in the United States this season. The 2009 H1N1 flu shot is being made in the same way that the seasonal flu shot is made. The 2009 H1N1 nasal spray flu vaccine \u2014 a vaccine made with live, weakened viruses that do not cause the flu (sometimes called LAIV for \"live attenuated influenza vaccine\"). The indications for who can get the 2009 H1N1 nasal spray vaccine are the same as for seasonal nasal spray vaccine. LAIV is approved for use in healthy* people 2 years to 49 years of age who are not pregnant. The nasal spray vaccine for use in the United States is being made by MedImmune, the same company that makes the seasonal nasal spray vaccine called \u201cFluMist\u00ae.\u201d The 2009 H1N1 nasal spray vaccine is being made in the same way as the seasonal nasal spray vaccine.\nAbout 2 weeks after vaccination, antibodies that provide protection against 2009 H1N1 influenza virus infection will develop in the body.\n\nThe 2009 H1N1 vaccine will not protect against seasonal influenza viruses. The vaccine for 2009 H1N1 flu will be the same for the entire 2009-2010 influenza season, which extends into the spring of 2010. The \"2009\" in the name only relates to the year the virus was first identified; it does not have to do with how long the vaccine will work or the year in which it should be administered. The 2009 H1N1 strain is not included in the 2009-2010 seasonal flu vaccine because it was identified after manufacturers had started making the seasonal flu vaccine.\ntop of page\n\nWhen to Get Vaccinated\nVaccination against 2009 H1N1 should begin now and continue throughout the influenza season, which extends into the spring of 2010. This is because the timing and duration of flu activity can vary. Flu seasons can last as late as April or May. By early October 2009, extensive 2009 H1N1 flu activity was being reported in the United States. It\u2019s possible that there may be waves of 2009 H1N1 activity during the 2009-2010 flu season that hit communities more than once over the course of the season. While 2009 H1N1 influenza virus is the predominant influenza virus in circulation, CDC still expects that seasonal influenza viruses will circulate and continues to recommend that people get a seasonal flu vaccine to protect against seasonal flu viruses. The ACIP has issued separate recommendations on who should get the 2009-10 seasonal vaccine.\n\nVaccine Supply\nVaccines to protect against 2009 H1N1 are widely available. More doses are expected for shipment each week. We ask members of the public who want to receive this vaccine to be patient as this program expands and more vaccine continues to become available.\n\nWho Should Get Vaccinated\nCDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a panel made up of medical and public health experts, met July 29, 2009, to make recommendations on who should receive the 2009 H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available. While the federal government has purchased enough vaccine so that anyone who wants to get vaccinated can, ACIP's statement on the \"Use of Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine\" recommends that vaccination efforts should focus first on people in five target groups who are at higher risk for 2009 H1N1 influenza or related complications, like children, especially those younger than 5 years of age and those who have high risk medical conditions, healthcare and emergency medical personnel who are likely to come in contact with influenza viruses as part of their occupation and could transmit influenza viruses to others in medical care settings, or those who are close contacts of infants younger than 6 months (who are too young to be vaccinated). These five target groups make up an estimated 159 million people in the United States.\n\nFor children younger than 10 years of age, CDC recommends that the two doses of 2009 H1N1 vaccine be separated by 4 weeks. However, if the second dose is separated from the first dose by at least 21 days, the second dose can be considered valid.\n\ntop of page\n\nLate Season Recommendations\nWhy should flu be taken seriously?\nFlu should never be dismissed as \u201cjust the flu.\u201d It\u2019s a serious disease, and while most cases are mild, some can be deadly.  So far this flu season, most flu activity has been caused by the 2009 H1N1 virus, which was first identified in April 2009 and caused the first flu pandemic in 40 years.\n\nBecause many people with influenza illness are not tested for flu or are tested late in their illness, methods have been developed to estimate the numbers of people with influenza illness and with influenza-related complications, including hospitalizations and deaths.  CDC estimates that from April to January 16, 2010, approximately 57 million cases of 2009 H1N1 occurred in the United States, including 257,000 H1N1-related hospitalizations and about 11,690 deaths. \n\nWith 2009 H1N1, approximately 90% of estimated hospitalizations and 87% of estimated deaths from April through January 16, 2010 occurred in people younger than 65 years old.  In contrast, with seasonal influenza, about 60% of seasonal flu-related hospitalizations and 90% of flu-related deaths occur in people 65 years and older.   This data confirms that the 2009 H1N1 impacted younger adults and children more than older adults compared to seasonal flu.  However, people in all age groups can develop severe illness from either seasonal flu or from 2009 H1N1.\n\nFlu season seems to be dying down\u2014Why do people still need a vaccination against 2009 H1N1?\nThe flu season is not over yet. As recently as January 15, 7 states were still reporting regional flu activity, so flu is still out there. Also, seasonal flu typically peaks in February and March and influenza activity can occur as late as May. So, increased activity from either seasonal flu, 2009 H1N1 or both are still possible this season.\nFor example, during the 1957-58 pandemic, flu activity dropped in December and January. Public health officials assumed the worst was over, and stopped encouraging people to get vaccinated. Then flu activity increased abruptly in February and March, and hospitalizations and deaths increased as well.\n\nThat was an important lesson\u2014even if flu activity dies down in January, as it has this year, the season is not over. It\u2019s still important to get vaccinated against the flu and be as prepared as possible if activity increases again this season.\n\nIs there anyone who should take priority when it comes to getting a flu vaccination?\nRight now there is enough vaccine for everyone who hasn\u2019t been vaccinated and wants to be. Children who are 9-years old or younger need two doses of vaccine about a month apart. There is enough vaccine for them as well.\n\nBut it is especially important for certain groups of people to get vaccinated. If you have certain underlying health conditions\u2014such as asthma, heart disease, or diabetes\u2014or if you\u2019re pregnant, you\u2019re at greater risk of complications from flu. If you\u2019re over 65, you\u2019re also at risk of complications.\n\nIf you\u2019re a health care worker, you should get vaccinated. If you care for or live with an infant under 6 months of age (babies less than 6 months old are too young to be vaccinated), you should get vaccinated, too, to prevent spreading the flu to people who are vulnerable.\n\nWhere should I go to get vaccinated against 2009 H1N1?\nThis is a very good time to get vaccinated. Right now not many people are sick, and there is enough vaccine for everyone who hasn\u2019t been vaccinated yet\u2014including kids 9 years old and younger who need a second dose.\n\nAn easy way to find out where vaccine is available in your area is by going to www.flu.gov and clicking on the vaccine locator. In addition, Flu.gov has a new Facebook application\u2014the \u201cFlu Fighter.\u201d It\u2019s one of the site\u2019s many \u201cviral\u201d communication tools to help spread the word that getting a vaccine against 2009 H1N1 is the best way to protect yourself and your friends. When you go to flu.gov please check it out.\nIf the second dose of 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine for children under 10 years of age is given over a month after the first dose, is it still considered effective?\nYes. CDC recommends that the two doses of vaccine against 2009 H1N1 influenza virus be separated by 4 weeks. However, if the second dose is separated from the first dose by at least 21 days, the second dose can be considered valid.\ntop of page\n\nWho Should Not Be Vaccinated\nThere are some people who should not get any flu vaccine without first consulting a physician. These include:\n\nPeople who have a severe allergy to chicken eggs.\nPeople who have had a severe reaction to an influenza vaccination.\nPeople who developed Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks of getting an influenza vaccine previously. (For information, see General Questions and Answers on Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS).\nChildren younger than 6 months of age (influenza vaccine is not approved for this age group), and\nPeople who have a moderate-to-severe illness with a fever (they should wait until they recover to get vaccinated.)\nVaccine Effectiveness\nThe ability of a flu vaccine to protect a person depends on the age and health status of the person getting the vaccine, and the similarity or \"match\" between the viruses or virus in the vaccine and those in circulation. CDC analyzes circulating inflluenza viruses on an ongoing basis to determine how closely matched they are to vaccine viruses and publishes the information weekly in FluView. In addition, every year CDC monitors vaccine effectiveness. For more information about flu vaccine effectiveness, see How Well Does the Seasonal Vaccine Work? \n\ntop of page\n\nVaccine Side Effects (What to Expect)\nThe same side effects typically associated with the seasonal flu shot and the seasonal nasal spray vaccine are expected with the 2009 H1N1 flu shot and 2009 H1N1 nasal spray vaccine.\n\nThese are:\n\nThe flu shot: The viruses in the flu shot are killed (inactivated), so you cannot get the flu from a flu shot. Some minor side effects that could occur are:\n\nSoreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given\nFever (low grade)\nAches\nIf these problems occur, they begin soon after the shot, are usually mild, and usually last 1 to 2 days. Almost all people who receive influenza vaccine have no serious problems from it. However, on rare occasions, flu vaccination can cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions.\n\nThe nasal spray: The viruses in the nasal-spray vaccine are weakened and do not cause severe symptoms often associated with influenza illness. (In clinical studies, transmission of vaccine viruses to close contacts has occurred only rarely.)\nIn children, side effects from LAIV can include:\n\nrunny nose\nwheezing\nheadache\nvomiting\nmuscle aches\nfever\nIn adults, side effects from LAIV can include\n\nrunny nose\nheadache\nsore throat\ncough\nFor more information about vaccine side effects and safety see General Questions and Answers on 2009 H1N1 Influenza Vaccine Safety.",

            "Text": "CDC is releasing updated interim guidance on infection control measures to prevent transmission of 2009 H1N1 influenza in healthcare facilities. The updated interim guidance applies uniquely to the special circumstances of the current 2009 H1N1 pandemic and will be updated as necessary as new information becomes available throughout the course of this influenza season. It provides general guidance for all healthcare facilities. The updated guidance expands on earlier guidance by emphasizing that successfully preventing transmission requires a comprehensive approach, beginning with pandemic planning that includes developing written plans that are flexible and adaptable should changes occur in the severity of illness or other aspects of 2009 H1N1 and seasonal influenza. Revisions from earlier guidance include: criteria for identification of suspected influenza patients; recommended time away from work for healthcare personnel; changes to isolation precautions based on tasks and anticipated exposures; expansion of information on the hierarchy of controls which ranks preventive interventions in the following order of preference: elimination of exposures, engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment; and changes to guidance on use of respiratory protection.\n\nPlease note that CDC is in the process of updating and replacing this interim guidance.  Click here for more information.\n\nDefinition of Healthcare Personnel\nFor the purposes of this guidance, healthcare personnel are defined as all persons whose occupational activities involve contact with patients or contaminated material in a healthcare, home healthcare, or clinical laboratory setting. Healthcare personnel are engaged in a range of occupations, many of which include patient contact even though they do not involve direct provision of patient care, such as dietary and housekeeping services. This guidance applies to healthcare personnel working in the following settings:  acute care hospitals, nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities, physician\u2019s offices, urgent care centers, outpatient clinics, and home healthcare agencies.  It also includes those working in clinical settings within non-healthcare institutions, such as school nurses or personnel staffing clinics in correctional facilities. The term \u201chealthcare personnel\u201d includes not only employees of the organization or agency, but also contractors, clinicians, volunteers, students, trainees, clergy, and others who may come in contact with patients.\n\nBackground\nMore communities are being affected by 2009 H1N1 influenza in fall/winter 2009-2010 than were in spring/summer 2009. Seasonal influenza viruses may also cause illness this fall and winter, possibly at the same time that 2009 H1N1 virus outbreaks are occurring. Although the severity, amount and timing of illness that 2009 H1N1 influenza and seasonal influenza will cause is uncertain, as with any influenza season, some people will require medical care as a result of their influenza virus infections.  In view of these and other uncertainties, healthcare facilities will need to be ready to adjust their pandemic influenza plans as dictated by changing conditions. Staff in healthcare settings should monitor the CDC and state and local health department websites for the latest information.\n\nSymptoms of Influenza and Viral Shedding\nThe symptoms of influenza, including 2009 H1N1 influenza, can include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.  Depending on the case series, the proportion of persons who have laboratory confirmed 2009 H1N1 infection and do not have fever can range from about 10 to 50%. Because influenza symptoms are nonspecific, it can be difficult to determine if a person has influenza based on symptoms alone. Nonetheless, decisions for clinical management, particularly for outpatients, in most cases can be made on the basis of clinical and epidemiological information. Information on diagnostic testing for 2009 H1N1 viral infection is available.\n\nIn general, the incubation period for influenza is estimated to range from 1 to 4 days with an average of 2 days.  Influenza virus shedding (the time during which a person might be infectious to another person) begins the day before illness onset and can persist for 5 to 7 days, although some persons may shed virus for longer periods, particularly young children and severely immunocompromised persons. The amount of virus shed is greatest in the first 2-3 days of illness and appears to correlate with fever, with higher amounts of virus shed when temperatures are highest.\n\nModes of 2009 H1N1 Influenza Transmission\n2009 H1N1 influenza virus appears to be transmitted from person to person through close contact in ways similar to other influenza viruses. Although the relative contribution of each mode is uncertain, influenza virus can potentially be transmitted through:\n\nDroplet exposure of mucosal surfaces (e.g., nose, mouth, and eyes) by respiratory secretions from coughing or sneezing;\nContact, usually of hands, with an infectious patient or fomite (a surface that is contaminated with secretions) followed by self-inoculation of virus onto mucosal surfaces such as those of the nose, mouth, and eyes; and\nSmall particle aerosols in the vicinity of the infectious individual.\nTransmission of influenza through the air over longer distances, such as from one patient room to another, is thought not to occur. All respiratory secretions and bodily fluids, including diarrheal stools, of patients with 2009 H1N1 influenza are considered to be potentially infectious.\n\ntop of page\n\nGENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS\nReview Pandemic Plans for the 2009-2010 Fall/Winter Influenza Season\nFacilities should review and, if not already in place, develop written pandemic influenza plans anticipating widespread transmission of 2009 H1N1 influenza in communities. CDC, with input from other federal partners, has developed checklistsExternal Web Site Icon  to help healthcare facilities in their planning and preparedness for pandemic influenza. OSHA has also developed detailed guidance for healthcare settings Adobe PDF fileExternal Web Site Icon. Links to specific checklists and other planning resources are provided in the Appendix. Facilities should also check with state and local health departments for local guidance. During the planning process, facilities should review their work areas and job tasks to identify workers who will routinely be in close contact with influenza patients so that preventive strategies can be targeted and exposure that is not essential can be limited. Facilities also should consider their own unique circumstances and needs that may not be addressed in guidance documents. Planning committees can facilitate this process. Strong sustained management commitment and active worker participation in a comprehensive, coordinated prevention program are extremely important in promoting implementation of, and adherence to, prevention recommendations.\n\nUse a Hierarchy of Controls to Prevent Influenza Transmission in Healthcare Settings\nFacilities should use a hierarchy of controls approach to prevent exposure of healthcare personnel and patients and prevent influenza transmission within healthcare settings. The hierarchy of controls to protect workers from occupational injury or illness places preventive interventions in groups that are ranked according to their likely effectiveness in reducing or removing the source of exposure. To apply the hierarchy of controls to prevention of influenza transmission, facilities should take the following steps, in order of preference:\n\nElimination of potential exposures:  Eliminating the potential source of exposure ranks highest in the hierarchy of controls. Examples of interventions in this category include: taking steps to minimize outpatient visits for patients with mild influenza-like illness who do not have risk factors for complications, postponing elective visits by patients with suspected or confirmed influenza until they are no longer infectious, and denying entry to visitors who are sick.\nEngineering controls:  Engineering controls rank second in the hierarchy of controls. They are particularly effective because they reduce or eliminate exposures at the source and many can be implemented without placing primary responsibility of implementation on individual employees. In addition, these controls can protect patients as well as personnel. Examples of engineering controls include installing partitions in triage areas and other public spaces, to reduce exposures by shielding personnel and other patients; and using closed suctioning systems for airways suction in intubated patients.\nAdministrative controls: Administrative controls are required work practices and policies that prevent exposures. As a group, they rank third in the hierarchy of controls because their effectiveness is dependent on consistent implementation by management and employees. Examples of administrative controls include promoting and providing vaccination; enforcing exclusion of ill healthcare personnel, implementing respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette strategies; and setting up triage stations and separate areas for patients who visit emergency departments with influenza-like illness, managing patient flow, and assigning dedicated staff to minimize the number of healthcare personnel exposed to those with suspected or confirmed influenza.\nPersonal protective equipment (PPE): PPE ranks lowest in the hierarchy of controls. It is a last line of defense for individuals against hazards that cannot otherwise be eliminated or controlled. While providing personnel with appropriate PPE and education in its use is important, effectiveness of PPE is dependent on a number of factors. PPE is effective only if used throughout potential exposure periods. PPE will not be effective if adherence is incomplete or when exposures to infectious patients or ill co-workers are unrecognized. In addition, PPE must be used and maintained properly, and must function properly, to be effective.\nCareful attention to elimination of potential exposures, engineering controls, and administrative controls will reduce the need to rely on PPE, including respirators. This is an especially important consideration during the current year, when shortages of respirators have already been reported by many healthcare facilities.\n\nIt should be recognized that individual interventions may have a level of importance different from that suggested by their classification within the hierarchy of controls. For example, vaccination is an administrative control that depends upon the actions of both management and employees. However, vaccination is one of the most important interventions for preventing transmission of influenza to healthcare personnel. Its ability to prevent influenza transmission in both work and community settings is especially important, because influenza is a community-based infection that is transmitted in household and community settings. Other interventions that work in healthcare settings alone will not prevent such transmission.\n\nExamples of preventive interventions that can be used to prevent or reduce influenza infections, grouped according to the hierarchy of controls, are provided in Table 1.\n\nSpecific Recommendations\nPromote and administer the 2009 H1N1 influenza and seasonal influenza vaccines\nHealthcare and emergency medical services personnel are among the priority groups recommended to receive the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine.  To improve adherence, vaccination should be offered to healthcare personnel free of charge and during working hours. Vaccination campaigns with incentives such as lotteries with prizes should be considered. Healthcare facilities should require personnel who refuse vaccination to complete a declination form. The Veterans Health Administration Influenza Manual is a useful source of information on best practices and strategies for increasing immunization ratesExternal Web Site Icon.\n\nIt is not anticipated that the seasonal influenza vaccine will provide protection against the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus. However, it is anticipated that seasonal influenza viruses will also be present in the U.S. during the 2009-2010 influenza season.  Influenza vaccination is effective against these seasonal viruses and should continue to be provided to healthcare personnel and given to unvaccinated patients.\n\nEnforce respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette\nIn addition to limiting numbers of ill people in the facility (e.g., by access control), should be incorporated into infection control practices as part of Standard Precautions to prevent the transmission of all respiratory infections including 2009 H1N1 influenza.  This form of source control should be implemented by everyone in healthcare settings - patients, visitors, and staff alike. Respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette procedures should continue to be followed for the entire duration of stay.\n\nEstablish facility access control measures and triage procedures\nEstablish non-punitive policies that encourage or require ill health care personnel workers to stay home. This should include contractors as well as staff.\nPost signage at entry points instructing patients and visitors about hospital policies, including the need to notify staff immediately if they have signs and symptoms of influenza.\nEstablish mechanisms to identify patients with symptoms of respiratory illness at any point of entry to the facility. Provisions should be made for symptomatic patients to cover their nose and mouth with tissues when coughing or sneezing, or put on facemasks for source control, if tolerated, and for their prompt isolation and assessment. Information on diagnostic testing of patients for 2009 H1N1 influenza infection is available.\nEstablish triage procedures and engineering controls (e.g., partitions) that separate ill and well patients and limit the need for PPE use by staff. \nConsider limiting points of entry to the facility.\ntop of page\n\nManage visitor access and movement within the facility\nEstablish procedures for managing visitors to include:\n\nLimiting visitors for patients in isolation for influenza to persons who are necessary for the patient's emotional well-being and care. Visitors who have been in contact with the patient before and during hospitalization are a possible source of influenza for other patients, visitors, and staff.\nScheduling and controlling visits to allow for:  \nScreening for symptoms of acute respiratory illness before entering the hospital.\nInstruction, before entering the patient\u2019s room, on hand hygiene, limiting surfaces touched, and use of PPE according to current facility policy while in the patient's room. \nVisitors should not be present during aerosol-generating procedures.\nVisitors should be instructed to limit their movement within the facility.\nEstablish policies and procedures for patient placement and transport\nAny patient with respiratory illness consistent with influenza should promptly be asked to wear a facemask for source control, if tolerated, or cover their nose and mouth with tissues when coughing or sneezing, and placed directly in an individual room with the door kept closed, where medically appropriate. The precautions required for entry into patient rooms should be posted on the door. Once placed in rooms, patients with suspected or confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza should be encouraged to practice respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette when they are coughing or sneezing throughout their duration of stay.\n\nWhen a single patient room is not available, consultation with infection control personnel is recommended to assess the risks associated with other patient placement options (e.g., cohorting, keeping the patient with an existing roommate). Morel information on cohorting, including other factors that may affect cohorting decisions Adobe PDF file is available.\nFollow current facility procedures for transport and movement of patients under isolation precautions, including:\nCommunicating information about patients with suspected, probable or confirmed influenza to appropriate personnel before transferring them to other departments in the facility (e.g., radiology, laboratory) and to other facilities.\nLimiting patient transport and movement of patients outside of the room to medically necessary purposes and minimizing waiting times and delays associated with transport and procedures conducted outside the patient\u2019s room.\nProviding influenza patients with facemasks to wear for source control, as tolerated, and tissues to contain secretions when outside of their room.\nEncouraging patients who are able to perform hand hygiene to do so frequently and to follow respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette practices.\nProviding portable x-ray equipment in cohort areas to reduce the need for patient transport.\nLimit the number of healthcare personnel entering the isolation room\nHealthcare personnel entering the room of a patient in isolation should be limited to those truly necessary for performing patient care activities.\nApply isolation precautions\nThe following isolation precautions are recommended for healthcare personnel who are in close contact with patients with suspected or confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza. For the purposes of this document, close contact is defined as working within 6 feet of the patient or entering into a small enclosed airspace shared with the patient (e.g., average patient room):\n\nStandard Precautions - For all patient care, use nonsterile gloves for any contact with potentially infectious material, followed by hand hygiene immediately after glove removal; use gowns along with eye protection for any activity that might generate splashes of respiratory secretions or other infectious material.\nRespiratory Protection \u2013\nRecommendation: CDC continues to recommend the use of respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a fit-tested disposable N95 respirator for healthcare personnel who are in close contact with patients with suspected or confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza. This recommendation applies uniquely to the special circumstances of the current 2009 H1N1 pandemic during the fall and winter of 2009-2010 and CDC will continue to revisit its guidance as new information becomes available, within this season if necessary  \n\nBasis: The current recommendation is based on the unique conditions associated with the current pandemic, including low levels of population immunity to 2009 H1N1 influenza, availability of vaccination programs well after the start of the pandemic, susceptibility to infection of those in the age range of healthcare personnel, increased risk for complications of influenza in some healthcare personnel (e.g., pregnant women), and the potential for healthcare personnel to be exposed to 2009 H1N1 influenza patients because of their occupation.\n\nSupply considerations: CDC recognizes that some facilities are currently experiencing shortages of respiratory protection equipment and that further shortages are anticipated. Although the exact total supply in the public and private sectors is not known, a large gap between supply and demand is predicted. In the face of shortages, appropriate selection and use of respiratory protection is critical. A key strategy is to use source control, engineering, and administrative measures to reduce the numbers of workers who come in contact with patients who have influenza-like illness in order to reduce the consumption of respiratory protection equipment. For example, combining the use of triage procedures and use of partitions or other engineering controls might reduce exposures and the need for PPE.  Other strategies could include taking steps to either reduce consumption of disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators or extend their use.  Some facilities that are experienced in their use may also be able to use alternative PPE for certain applications including more protective filtering facepiece respirators, reusable elastomeric tight-fitting respirators, and reusable powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs).  For facilities that are able to use alternatives such as elastomeric respirators or PAPRs, processes must be in place to ensure that they are used properly and are reliably decontaminated. Additional information about these strategies, including frequently asked questions, are posted on the CDC 2009 H1N1 website.\n\nSpecial care should be taken to ensure that respirators are available for situations where respiratory protection is most important, such as performance of aerosol-generating procedures on patients with suspected or confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza or provision of care to patients with other infections for which respiratory protection is strongly indicated (e.g., tuberculosis).   \n\nPrioritized respirator use: Where a shortage of respirators exists despite reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a sufficient supply for anticipated needs, in particular for very high exposure risk situations such as some aerosol-generating procedures (listed below), a facility should consider shifting to a prioritized respirator use mode. In this mode, respirator use is prioritized to ensure availability for healthcare personnel at most risk from 2009 H1N1 influenza exposure. Even under conditions of prioritized use, personnel attending aerosol-generating procedures on patients with suspected or confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza should always use respiratory protection at least as protective as fitted N95 respirators. An example of prioritization for personnel not attending aerosol-generating procedures is shown in Table 2. Prioritization should be adapted to local conditions and should consider intensity and duration of exposure, personal health risk factors for complications of infection, and vaccination status. When in prioritized respirator use mode, respirator use may be temporarily discontinued for employees at lower risk of exposure to 2009 H1N1 influenza or lower risk of complicated infection. Gathering of personal information for the purposes of pandemic planning and response must be done in a fashion that is compliant with all applicable rules and regulations, including the Americans with DisabilitiesExternal Web Site Icon Act (ADA)External Web Site Icon. Contingency crisis planning is critical to efficient implementation of prioritized use during supply shortages. In making decisions about prioritization, facilities should consider needs for managing patients with diseases other than influenza that require respiratory protection (e.g. tuberculosis) and also considerations related to the timetable for obtaining more respirators. To assure that respirators are likely to be available for the most important uses, facilities should maintain a reserve sufficient to meet the estimated needs for performing aerosol-generating procedures and for managing patients with diseases other than influenza that require respiratory protection until supplies are expected to be replenished. \n\nFacemasks for healthcare personnel who are not provided a respirator due to the implementation of prioritized respirator use: If a facility is in prioritized respirator use mode and unable to provide respirators to healthcare personnel who provide care to suspected and confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza cases, the facility should provide those personnel with facemasks. Facemasks that have been cleared for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have been tested for their ability to resist blood and body fluids, and generally provide a physical barrier to droplets that are expelled directly at the user. Although they do not filter small particles from the air and they allow leakage around the mask, they are a barrier to splashes, droplet sprays, and autoinoculation of influenza virus from the hands to the nose and mouth. Thus, they should be chosen over no protection. Routine chemoprophylaxis is not recommended for personnel wearing facemasks during the care of patients with suspected or confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza.\n\ntop of page\n\nHand Hygiene\n\nHealthcare personnel should perform hand hygiene frequently, including before and after all patient contact, contact with respiratory secretions, and before putting on and upon removal of PPE. Soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizers should be used.\nAerosol-generating procedures\nSome procedures performed on patients are more likely to generate higher concentrations of respiratory aerosols than coughing, sneezing, talking, or breathing, presenting healthcare personnel with an increased risk of exposure to infectious agents present in the aerosol. Although there are limited objective data available on disease transmission related to such aerosols, many authorities view the following procedures as being very high exposure risk aerosol-generating procedures for which special precautions should be used:\n\nBronchoscopy\nSputum induction\nEndotracheal intubation and extubation\nOpen suctioning of airways\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation\nAutopsies\nAlthough some have suggested that administration of nebulized medications (due to risk of inducing cough), acquisition of nasopharyngeal swabs/samples, and use of high-flow oxygen might create infectious aerosols of concern, less is known about the magnitude or potential for exposure.\nA combination of measures should be used to reduce exposures from high-risk aerosol-generating procedures, including:\n\nOnly perform these procedures on patients with suspected or confirmed influenza if they are medically necessary and cannot be postponed.\nLimit the number of healthcare personnel present during the procedure to only those essential for patient care and support.\nConduct the procedures in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) when feasible.  Such rooms are designed to reduce the concentration of infectious aerosols and prevent their escape into adjacent areas using controlled air exchanges and directional airflow. They are single patient rooms at negative pressure relative to the surrounding areas, and with a minimum of 6 air changes per hour (12 air changes per hour are recommended for new construction or renovation). Air from these rooms should be exhausted directly to the outside or be filtered through a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter before recirculation. Room doors should be kept closed except when entering or leaving the room, and entry and exit should be minimized during and shortly after the procedure. Facilities should monitor and document the proper negative-pressure function of these rooms.\nPortable HEPA filtration units may be used to further reduce the concentration of contaminants in the air. Some of these units can connect to local exhaust ventilation systems (e.g. hoods, booths, tents) or have inlet designs that allow close placement to the patient in order to assist with source control; however, these units do not eliminate the need for respiratory protection for individuals entering the room because they may not entrain all of the room air. Information on air flow/air entrainment performance should be evaluated for such devices.\nHealthcare personnel should adhere to standard precautions, and wear respiratory protection equivalent to a fitted N95 filtering facepiece respirator or higher level of protection during aerosol-generating procedures.\nUnprotected healthcare personnel should not be allowed in a room where an aerosol-generating procedure has been conducted until sufficient time has elapsed to remove potentially infectious particles. More information on clearance rates under differing ventilation conditions is available. This table assumes perfect mixing. For example, based on the table, an AIIR with 6 air changes per hour and perfect room mixing will require 46 minutes to reduce the concentration of airborne particles by 99%.  For a more realistic assumption of good mixing, the clearance times provided in this table should be multiplied by a mixing factor of 3. Thus, for an AIIR with 6 air changes per hour and normal room mixing, over two hours will be required to reduce the concentration of airborne particles by 99%). Environmental surface cleaning also is necessary to ensure that environmental contamination does not lead to infection transmission.\nDuration of Isolation Precautions for Patients\nThe recommended duration of isolation precautions for hospitalized patients is longer than that recommended for other populations because duration of virus shedding is likely to be longer than for outpatients with milder illness.  Isolation precautions for patients who have influenza symptoms should be continued for the 7 days after illness onset or until 24 hours after the resolution of fever and respiratory symptoms, whichever is longer, while a patient is in a healthcare facility. Shedding of influenza viruses generally diminishes over the course of 7 days, with transmission apparently correlating with fever. Given this, if isolation resources (e.g. private rooms) become limited, these resources should be prioritized for patients who are earlier in the course of illness. Clinical judgment may be used for patients with only cough as a symptom, since cough after influenza infection may be prolonged and may not be an indicator of viral shedding.  Because some patients with influenza may not have fever but may be shedding influenza virus, patients with any respiratory symptoms should follow hand and respiratory hygiene recommendations, and healthcare personnel working with such patients should continue to follow standard precautions. Patients should be discharged from medical care when clinically appropriate, not based on the period of isolation.\n\nIn some cases, facilities may choose to continue isolation precautions for longer periods such as in the case of young children or severely immunocompromised patients, who may shed influenza virus for longer periods of time and who might be shedding antiviral resistant virus. Clinical judgment should be used to determine the need for continued isolation precautions for such patients. Communications regarding the patient\u2019s diagnosis with post hospital care providers (e.g. Home-healthcare agencies, long-term care facilities) as well as transporting agencies is essential.\n\nMonitor and Manage Ill Healthcare Personnel\nEmployee health services should establish procedures for tracking absences; reviewing job tasks and identifying personnel at higher risk for complications; assuring that employees have access via telephone to medical consultation and, if necessary, early treatment; and promptly identifying individuals with possible influenza. Healthcare personnel should self-assess for symptoms of febrile respiratory illness. An active approach in which personnel are asked daily about symptoms of febrile respiratory illness is also recommended. In most cases, decisions about work restrictions and assignments for personnel with respiratory illness should be guided by clinical signs and symptoms rather than by laboratory testing for influenza. Personnel should be provided with information about risk factors for complications of influenza, so those at higher risk know to promptly seek medical attention and be evaluated for early treatment if they develop symptoms of influenza. All personnel should be provided with specific instructions to follow in the event of respiratory illness with rapid progression, particularly when experiencing shortness of breath. Anyone with the following emergency warning signs needs urgent medical attention and should seek medical care promptly:\n\nDifficulty breathing or shortness of breath\nPain or pressure in the chest or abdomen\nSudden dizziness\nConfusion\nSevere or persistent vomiting\nFlu-like symptoms improve but then return with fever and worse cough\nHealthcare personnel who develop a fever and respiratory symptoms should be:\n\nInstructed not to report to work, or if at work, to promptly notify their supervisor and infection control personnel/occupational health.\nExcluded from work for at least 24 hours after they no longer have a fever, without the use of fever-reducing medicines.\nIf returning to work in areas where severely immunocompromised patients are provided care, considered for temporary reassignment or exclusion from work for 7 days from symptom onset or until the resolution of symptoms, whichever is longer. Clinical judgment should be used for personnel with only cough as a symptom, since cough after influenza infection may be prolonged and may not be an indicator of viral shedding. Healthcare personnel recovering from a respiratory illness may return to work with immunocompromised patients sooner if absence of 2009 H1N1 viral RNA in respiratory secretions is documented by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Additional information on diagnostic testing for 2009 H1N1 influenza infection is available.\nReminded of the importance of practicing frequent hand hygiene (especially before and after each patient contact) and respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette after returning to work following an acute respiratory illness.\nHealthcare personnel who develop acute respiratory symptoms without fever should be:\n\nAllowed to continue or return to work unless assigned in areas where severely immunocompromised patients are provided care. In this case they should be considered for temporary reassignment or exclusion from work for 7 days from symptom onset or until the resolution of symptoms, whichever is longer. Clinical judgment should be used for personnel with only cough as a symptom, since cough after influenza infection may be prolonged and may not be an indicator of viral shedding. Healthcare personnel recovering from a respiratory illness may return to work with immunocompromised patients sooner if absence of 2009 H1N1 viral RNA in respiratory secretions is documented by rRT-PCR. Additional information on diagnostic testing for 2009 H1N1 influenza infection is available.\nReminded of the importance of practicing frequent hand hygiene (especially before and after each patient contact) and respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette after returning to work following an acute respiratory illness.\nFacilities and organizations providing healthcare services should:\nEnsure that sick leave policies for healthcare personnel (e.g., staff and contract personnel) are flexible and consistent with public health guidance and that employees are aware of the policies.\nEnsure that sick employees are able to stay home without fear of losing their jobs.\nConsider offering alternative work environments as an accommodation for employees at higher risk for complications of 2009 H1N1 influenza during periods of increased influenza activity or if influenza severity increases.\nNot require a doctor\u2019s note for workers with influenza to validate their illness or return to work.\nAntiviral Treatment and Chemoprophylaxis of Healthcare Personnel\nPlease refer to the CDC web site for the most current recommendations on the use of antiviral agents for treatment and chemoprophylaxis. All healthcare personnel concerned about symptoms of influenza should seek advice from their medical provider promptly.\n\nTraining and Education of Healthcare Personnel\nAll healthcare personnel should receive training on influenza prevention and risks for complications of influenza. The training should include information on risk assessment; isolation precautions; vaccination protocols; use of engineering and administrative controls and personal protective equipment; protection during high-risk aerosol-generating procedures; signs, symptoms, and complications of influenza; and to promptly seek medical attention for any concerns about symptoms of influenza.\n\nHealthcare Personnel at Higher Risk for Complications of Influenza\nPersonnel at higher risk for complications from influenza infection include pregnant women, persons 65 years old and older, and persons with chronic diseases such as asthma, heart disease, diabetes, diseases that suppress the immune system, and certain other chronic medical conditions. Vaccination and early treatment with antiviral medications are very important for healthcare personnel at higher risk for influenza complications because they can prevent hospitalizations and deaths. Healthcare personnel at higher risk for complications should check with their healthcare provider if they become ill so that they can receive early treatment.\n\ntop of page\n\nEnvironmental Infection Control\nRoutine cleaning and disinfection strategies used during influenza seasons can be applied to the environmental management of 2009 H1N1 influenza.  Management of laundry, utensils and medical waste should also be performed in accordance with procedures followed for seasonal influenza. More information is available. able 1.

            "Text": "Surveillance for Influenza and Pneumonia-Associated Hospitalizations and Deaths for the 2009-2010 Season\nHow are influenza hospitalizations and deaths going to be tracked this season?\nCDC has asked states to report either laboratory confirmed hospitalizations and deaths or syndromic cases, i.e. cases of presumed influenza and/or pneumonia based on ICD-9 coded hospitalizations or death reports each week. These will be reports of all influenza and pneumonia-related hospitalizations and deaths, not just those due to 2009 H1N1.\n\nIs reporting hospitalizations and deaths associated with flu new?\nUpdated Nov 06\nRoutine seasonal surveillance does not count individual flu cases, hospitalizations or deaths (except for pediatric influenza deaths) but instead monitors activity levels and trends and virus characteristics through a nationwide surveillance system. The reporting of hospitalizations and deaths by state health departments was a new surveillance system that was initiated at the beginning of the 2009 H1N1 outbreak.\n\nBeginning August 30, 2009, CDC modified this surveillance and asked states to report either laboratory confirmed hospitalizations and deaths or syndromic cases, i.e. cases of presumed influenza and/or pneumonia based on ICD-9 coded hospitalizations or death reports each week. This is a new system will be used to monitor trends in hospitalizations and deaths. CDC believes this system will provide a fuller picture of the burden of serious flu illness and deaths during this pandemic. This number will be cross-checked periodically against modeling studies to assess its validity. CDC has provided guidance for states on how to count and report these cases.\n\nExactly how are states reporting influenza and pneumonia-associated hospitalizations and deaths to CDC?\nCDC has developed a web-based data application with which states can submit their influenza and pneumonia-associated hospitalization and death reports. Using this online system, data from each state is due by midnight each Tuesday and compiled and analyzed by CDC for publication the following Friday of the same week. Data from each reporting week runs from Sunday to Saturday, which is consistent with the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR).  So, data from Sunday through Saturday is reported to CDC on the Tuesday of the next week and reported in the FluView report three days later, on Friday.\n\nWill tracking of 2009 H1N1 hospitalizations and deaths after August 30 be the same as it was in the spring and summer?\nNo, tracking of 2009 H1N1 hospitalizations and deaths will not be the same after August 30, 2009. In an effort to add additional structure to the national 2009 H1N1 reporting, new case definitions for influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths were implemented on August 30, 2009. The new definitions allow states to report to CDC hospitalizations and deaths (either confirmed OR probable) resulting from all types of influenza, not just those from 2009 H1N1 flu. This is a broader set of data than states were previously reporting as it now includes 1) laboratory-confirmed influenza for all types of influenza, and 2) pneumonia and influenza cases identified from hospital records, most of which will not be laboratory confirmed.\n\nReporting of Influenza and Pneumonia-Associated Hospitalizations and Deaths for the 2009-2010 Season\nWhy was the definition of what states should report broadened?\nUpdated Nov 06\nThe definition of what states should report was broadened to include all laboratory-confirmed influenza and influenza and pneumonia syndrome for three reasons:\n\nCDC believes that regular seasonal influenza viruses will co-circulate with 2009 H1N1 influenza and capturing all laboratory-confirmed influenza will provide a fuller picture of the burden of all flu during the pandemic.\nThere are too many cases of flu to test and confirm so laboratory-confirmed data is a vast underestimate of the true number of cases and this bias would be exacerbated over the course of the pandemic as more and more people become ill.\nInfluenza and pneumonia syndrome are diagnostic code used by all hospitals. Capturing this number will reflect a fuller picture of influenza and influenza-related serious illness and deaths in the United States during the pandemic. However, influenza and pneumonia syndrome hospitalizations and deaths may be an overestimate of actual number of flu-related hospitalizations and deaths because they are less specific for influenza, but these data can be helpful in following disease trends.\nDo the numbers reported now include 2009 H1N1 cases in the spring and summer?\nNo. The number of reported hospitalizations and deaths was \u201cre-set\u201d to zero on August 30. The report of the first week of data for the newly defined system will appear in the September 11, 2009 FluView.\n\nWhy is CDC re-setting reported hospitalizations and deaths numbers for the 2009-10 influenza season?\nAt the request of the states, and in preparation for what is expected to be an early 2009-2010 flu season, CDC began a new reporting season for flu-associated hospitalizations and deaths on August 30, 2009. The first counts of the new reporting season appeared on September 11, 2009.\n\nWhen will the rest of CDC\u2019s surveillance systems be \u201cre-set\u201d?\nCDC\u2019s regular flu surveillance systems (not including the hospitalizations and deaths reporting system) are long-standing systems that run year-round. These regular reporting systems \u201cre-set\u201d each October (during Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) Week 40 \u2013 October 4-10, 2009) in anticipation of a new flu season. CDC\u2019s standard influenza surveillance, which includes viral surveillance, sentinel physician surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI), deaths from the 122 Cities Mortality Monitoring System, and the number of laboratory-confirmed deaths from influenza among children, will all re-set starting with MMWR Week 40 as usual.\n\nIf states are reporting aggregate influenza hospitalizations and deaths, how will you tell what percentage of cases is due to 2009 H1N1 and what percentage is due seasonal influenza viruses?\nUpdated Nov 6\nDue to CDC\u2019s new case definitions, there will be no definitive way to differentiate between hospitalizations and deaths due to seasonal influenza versus those due to 2009 H1N1 influenza from aggregate reporting. However, information on the proportion of influenza viruses that are 2009 H1N1 versus seasonal influenza will continue to be reported in FluView from the virologic surveillance system. (For example, as of October 31, 2009, mare than 99% of all subtyped influenza A viruses being reported to CDC were 2009 H1N1 viruses.)\n\ntop of page\n\nWill states be reporting confirmed cases?\nIn the surveillance guidance provided to states, CDC has asked states to report either laboratory confirmed hospitalizations and deaths or syndromic cases, i.e. cases of presumed influenza and/or pneumonia based on ICD-9 coded hospitalizations or death reports.\n\nWhat does this mean?\nLaboratory confirmed influenza hospitalizations and deaths are those that were confirmed as attributed to influenza infection by a laboratory test. Syndromic influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths are those caused by suspected or probable influenza or pneumonia. \n\nSo different states will be reporting according to different criteria?\nYes, the new definition of influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths will allow some states to report confirmed cases, and others to report suspected/probable cases based on surveillance systems available in individual states. \n\nHow accurate a representation are these numbers?\nUpdated Nov 06\n\nLaboratory-confirmed data is thought to be an underestimation of the true number of cases because most people will not be tested for influenza. However, influenza and pneumonia syndrome hospitalizations and deaths may be an overestimate of actual number of flu-related hospitalizations and deaths because that diagnostic category includes other illnesses. Influenza and pneumonia syndromic reports are less specific to influenza, but are helpful in following disease trends.\n\nWill the old 2009 H1N1 counts prior to August 30, 2009 remain available?\nYes, the cumulative number of 2009 H1N1-related hospitalizations and deaths reported to CDC from April through August 2009 will be archived and available for future reference.\n\nWhat hospitalizations and death information will CDC report publicly?\nAdded Nov 06\n\nFrom August 30-October 24, 2009 CDC publicly posted reports of both laboratory-confirmed influenza for all types of influenza AND syndromic cases, i.e., cases of presumed influenza and/or pneumonia based on ICD-9 coded hospitalizations or death reports each week. From the week beginning October 25-31, 2009; however, CDC will only publicly report laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths. The reason for this change in public reporting is that the interpretation of syndromic data (most of which is not laboratory-confirmed) relative to laboratory-confirmed data has been challenging. CDC will continue to collect and analyze both laboratory-confirmed and syndromic data reported to CDC by states.\n\nHow many states are reporting laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations and deaths?\nAdded Nov 06\n\nThe number of states reporting laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations and deaths varies each week, however, for the week of October 25-31, 2009, more than 30 U.S. states were continuing to report laboratory-confirmed data.\n\nRegular Surveillance Systems\n\nWhen did CDC stop reporting flu activity for the 2009-10 flu season?\nThe final CDC influenza activity report for the 2009-10 season appeared on May 28, 2010. While influenza surveillance is carried out year-round, official reporting (FluView publication) routinely happens between October and May to coincide with normally occurring influenza activity in the United States. FluView production will resume during MMWR week 40 (October 3-October 9, 2010). This will be the first report of the 2010-2011 flu season, and will be distributed on October 15. Surveillance reports for all influenza viruses for the 2010-2011 season \u2013 including the 2009 H1N1 virus -- will appear on the seasonal influenza website.\n\nWhat does regular influenza surveillance consist of?\nRegular surveillance includes:\n\nViral surveillance, which monitors\nThe percentage of specimens tested for influenza that are positive for influenza;\nThe types and subtypes of influenza viruses circulating;\nResistance to influenza antiviral medications, and\nThe emergence of new strains\nSentinel physician surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI), which monitors the percentage of doctor visits for symptoms that could be the flu.\nHospitalization surveillance, which tracks numbers of hospitalizations with laboratory-confirmed flu infections among adults and children.\nSummary of the geographic spread of flu, which tracks the number of states affected by flu and the degree to which they are affected.\nDeaths from 122 Cities that report the total number of deaths and the percentage of those that are coded as influenza or pneumonia.\nThe number of laboratory-confirmed deaths from influenza among children.\nHow is CDC\u2019s traditional flu surveillance system reported?\nCDC\u2019s flu surveillance is reported in a weekly publication called FluView. The Epidemiology and Prevention Branch in the Influenza Division at CDC collects, compiles and analyzes information on flu activity in the U.S. year-round to produce and publish FluView every Friday. Usually FluView is published from October through mid-May, but in response to the ongoing novel H1N1 flu spread, weekly publication of FluView continued over the summer months.\n\nWhy is FluView dated a week earlier than the date it is posted?\nFlu surveillance data collection is based on a reporting week that starts on Sunday and ends on Saturday of each week. Each surveillance participant is requested to summarize weekly data and submit it to CDC by Tuesday afternoon of the following week. Those data are then downloaded, compiled, and analyzed at CDC and posted on the web on Friday, 3 days later.\n\nFor more information about CDC\u2019s surveillance systems, see Overview of Influenza Surveillance in the United States.\n\n2009 H1N1 Individual Case Counts\nWhy did CDC stop reporting confirmed and probable 2009 H1N1 flu cases?\nIndividual case counts were kept early during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak when the 2009 H1N1 virus first emerged. As the outbreak expanded and became more widespread, individual case counts become increasingly impractical and not representative of the true extent of the outbreak. This isbecause only a small proportion of persons with respiratory illness are actually tested and confirmed for influenza (including 2009 H1N1) so the true benefit of keeping track of these numbers is questionable. In addition, the extensive spread of 2009 H1N1 flu within the United States made it extremely resource-intensive for states to count individual cases. On July 24, 2009, CDC discontinued reporting of individual cases of 2009 H1N1, but continued to track hospitalizations and deaths.",

            "Text": "CDC is releasing updated interim guidance on infection control measures to prevent transmission of 2009 H1N1 influenza in healthcare facilities. The updated interim guidance applies uniquely to the special circumstances of the current 2009 H1N1 pandemic and will be updated as necessary as new information becomes available throughout the course of this influenza season. It provides general guidance for all healthcare facilities. The updated guidance expands on earlier guidance by emphasizing that successfully preventing transmission requires a comprehensive approach, beginning with pandemic planning that includes developing written plans that are flexible and adaptable should changes occur in the severity of illness or other aspects of 2009 H1N1 and seasonal influenza. Revisions from earlier guidance include: criteria for identification of suspected influenza patients; recommended time away from work for healthcare personnel; changes to isolation precautions based on tasks and anticipated exposures; expansion of information on the hierarchy of controls which ranks preventive interventions in the following order of preference: elimination of exposures, engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment; and changes to guidance on use of respiratory protection.\n\nPlease note that CDC is in the process of updating and replacing this interim guidance.  Click here for more information.\n\nDefinition of Healthcare Personnel\nFor the purposes of this guidance, healthcare personnel are defined as all persons whose occupational activities involve contact with patients or contaminated material in a healthcare, home healthcare, or clinical laboratory setting. Healthcare personnel are engaged in a range of occupations, many of which include patient contact even though they do not involve direct provision of patient care, such as dietary and housekeeping services. This guidance applies to healthcare personnel working in the following settings:  acute care hospitals, nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities, physician\u2019s offices, urgent care centers, outpatient clinics, and home healthcare agencies.  It also includes those working in clinical settings within non-healthcare institutions, such as school nurses or personnel staffing clinics in correctional facilities. The term \u201chealthcare personnel\u201d includes not only employees of the organization or agency, but also contractors, clinicians, volunteers, students, trainees, clergy, and others who may come in contact with patients.\n\nBackground\nMore communities are being affected by 2009 H1N1 influenza in fall/winter 2009-2010 than were in spring/summer 2009. Seasonal influenza viruses may also cause illness this fall and winter, possibly at the same time that 2009 H1N1 virus outbreaks are occurring. Although the severity, amount and timing of illness that 2009 H1N1 influenza and seasonal influenza will cause is uncertain, as with any influenza season, some people will require medical care as a result of their influenza virus infections.  In view of these and other uncertainties, healthcare facilities will need to be ready to adjust their pandemic influenza plans as dictated by changing conditions. Staff in healthcare settings should monitor the CDC and state and local health department websites for the latest information.\n\nSymptoms of Influenza and Viral Shedding\nThe symptoms of influenza, including 2009 H1N1 influenza, can include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.  Depending on the case series, the proportion of persons who have laboratory confirmed 2009 H1N1 infection and do not have fever can range from about 10 to 50%. Because influenza symptoms are nonspecific, it can be difficult to determine if a person has influenza based on symptoms alone. Nonetheless, decisions for clinical management, particularly for outpatients, in most cases can be made on the basis of clinical and epidemiological information. Information on diagnostic testing for 2009 H1N1 viral infection is available.\n\nIn general, the incubation period for influenza is estimated to range from 1 to 4 days with an average of 2 days.  Influenza virus shedding (the time during which a person might be infectious to another person) begins the day before illness onset and can persist for 5 to 7 days, although some persons may shed virus for longer periods, particularly young children and severely immunocompromised persons. The amount of virus shed is greatest in the first 2-3 days of illness and appears to correlate with fever, with higher amounts of virus shed when temperatures are highest.\n\nModes of 2009 H1N1 Influenza Transmission\n2009 H1N1 influenza virus appears to be transmitted from person to person through close contact in ways similar to other influenza viruses. Although the relative contribution of each mode is uncertain, influenza virus can potentially be transmitted through:\n\nDroplet exposure of mucosal surfaces (e.g., nose, mouth, and eyes) by respiratory secretions from coughing or sneezing;\nContact, usually of hands, with an infectious patient or fomite (a surface that is contaminated with secretions) followed by self-inoculation of virus onto mucosal surfaces such as those of the nose, mouth, and eyes; and\nSmall particle aerosols in the vicinity of the infectious individual.\nTransmission of influenza through the air over longer distances, such as from one patient room to another, is thought not to occur. All respiratory secretions and bodily fluids, including diarrheal stools, of patients with 2009 H1N1 influenza are considered to be potentially infectious.\n\ntop of page\n\nGENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS\nReview Pandemic Plans for the 2009-2010 Fall/Winter Influenza Season\nFacilities should review and, if not already in place, develop written pandemic influenza plans anticipating widespread transmission of 2009 H1N1 influenza in communities. CDC, with input from other federal partners, has developed checklistsExternal Web Site Icon  to help healthcare facilities in their planning and preparedness for pandemic influenza. OSHA has also developed detailed guidance for healthcare settings Adobe PDF fileExternal Web Site Icon. Links to specific checklists and other planning resources are provided in the Appendix. Facilities should also check with state and local health departments for local guidance. During the planning process, facilities should review their work areas and job tasks to identify workers who will routinely be in close contact with influenza patients so that preventive strategies can be targeted and exposure that is not essential can be limited. Facilities also should consider their own unique circumstances and needs that may not be addressed in guidance documents. Planning committees can facilitate this process. Strong sustained management commitment and active worker participation in a comprehensive, coordinated prevention program are extremely important in promoting implementation of, and adherence to, prevention recommendations.\n\nUse a Hierarchy of Controls to Prevent Influenza Transmission in Healthcare Settings\nFacilities should use a hierarchy of controls approach to prevent exposure of healthcare personnel and patients and prevent influenza transmission within healthcare settings. The hierarchy of controls to protect workers from occupational injury or illness places preventive interventions in groups that are ranked according to their likely effectiveness in reducing or removing the source of exposure. To apply the hierarchy of controls to prevention of influenza transmission, facilities should take the following steps, in order of preference:\n\nElimination of potential exposures:  Eliminating the potential source of exposure ranks highest in the hierarchy of controls. Examples of interventions in this category include: taking steps to minimize outpatient visits for patients with mild influenza-like illness who do not have risk factors for complications, postponing elective visits by patients with suspected or confirmed influenza until they are no longer infectious, and denying entry to visitors who are sick.\nEngineering controls:  Engineering controls rank second in the hierarchy of controls. They are particularly effective because they reduce or eliminate exposures at the source and many can be implemented without placing primary responsibility of implementation on individual employees. In addition, these controls can protect patients as well as personnel. Examples of engineering controls include installing partitions in triage areas and other public spaces, to reduce exposures by shielding personnel and other patients; and using closed suctioning systems for airways suction in intubated patients.\nAdministrative controls: Administrative controls are required work practices and policies that prevent exposures. As a group, they rank third in the hierarchy of controls because their effectiveness is dependent on consistent implementation by management and employees. Examples of administrative controls include promoting and providing vaccination; enforcing exclusion of ill healthcare personnel, implementing respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette strategies; and setting up triage stations and separate areas for patients who visit emergency departments with influenza-like illness, managing patient flow, and assigning dedicated staff to minimize the number of healthcare personnel exposed to those with suspected or confirmed influenza.\nPersonal protective equipment (PPE): PPE ranks lowest in the hierarchy of controls. It is a last line of defense for individuals against hazards that cannot otherwise be eliminated or controlled. While providing personnel with appropriate PPE and education in its use is important, effectiveness of PPE is dependent on a number of factors. PPE is effective only if used throughout potential exposure periods. PPE will not be effective if adherence is incomplete or when exposures to infectious patients or ill co-workers are unrecognized. In addition, PPE must be used and maintained properly, and must function properly, to be effective.\nCareful attention to elimination of potential exposures, engineering controls, and administrative controls will reduce the need to rely on PPE, including respirators. This is an especially important consideration during the current year, when shortages of respirators have already been reported by many healthcare facilities.\n\nIt should be recognized that individual interventions may have a level of importance different from that suggested by their classification within the hierarchy of controls. For example, vaccination is an administrative control that depends upon the actions of both management and employees. However, vaccination is one of the most important interventions for preventing transmission of influenza to healthcare personnel. Its ability to prevent influenza transmission in both work and community settings is especially important, because influenza is a community-based infection that is transmitted in household and community settings. Other interventions that work in healthcare settings alone will not prevent such transmission.\n\nExamples of preventive interventions that can be used to prevent or reduce influenza infections, grouped according to the hierarchy of controls, are provided in Table 1.\n\nSpecific Recommendations\nPromote and administer the 2009 H1N1 influenza and seasonal influenza vaccines\nHealthcare and emergency medical services personnel are among the priority groups recommended to receive the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine.  To improve adherence, vaccination should be offered to healthcare personnel free of charge and during working hours. Vaccination campaigns with incentives such as lotteries with prizes should be considered. Healthcare facilities should require personnel who refuse vaccination to complete a declination form. The Veterans Health Administration Influenza Manual is a useful source of information on best practices and strategies for increasing immunization ratesExternal Web Site Icon.\n\nIt is not anticipated that the seasonal influenza vaccine will provide protection against the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus. However, it is anticipated that seasonal influenza viruses will also be present in the U.S. during the 2009-2010 influenza season.  Influenza vaccination is effective against these seasonal viruses and should continue to be provided to healthcare personnel and given to unvaccinated patients.\n\nEnforce respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette\nIn addition to limiting numbers of ill people in the facility (e.g., by access control), should be incorporated into infection control practices as part of Standard Precautions to prevent the transmission of all respiratory infections including 2009 H1N1 influenza.  This form of source control should be implemented by everyone in healthcare settings - patients, visitors, and staff alike. Respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette procedures should continue to be followed for the entire duration of stay.\n\nEstablish facility access control measures and triage procedures\nEstablish non-punitive policies that encourage or require ill health care personnel workers to stay home. This should include contractors as well as staff.\nPost signage at entry points instructing patients and visitors about hospital policies, including the need to notify staff immediately if they have signs and symptoms of influenza.\nEstablish mechanisms to identify patients with symptoms of respiratory illness at any point of entry to the facility. Provisions should be made for symptomatic patients to cover their nose and mouth with tissues when coughing or sneezing, or put on facemasks for source control, if tolerated, and for their prompt isolation and assessment. Information on diagnostic testing of patients for 2009 H1N1 influenza infection is available.\nEstablish triage procedures and engineering controls (e.g., partitions) that separate ill and well patients and limit the need for PPE use by staff. \nConsider limiting points of entry to the facility.\ntop of page\n\nManage visitor access and movement within the facility\nEstablish procedures for managing visitors to include:\n\nLimiting visitors for patients in isolation for influenza to persons who are necessary for the patient's emotional well-being and care. Visitors who have been in contact with the patient before and during hospitalization are a possible source of influenza for other patients, visitors, and staff.\nScheduling and controlling visits to allow for:  \nScreening for symptoms of acute respiratory illness before entering the hospital.\nInstruction, before entering the patient\u2019s room, on hand hygiene, limiting surfaces touched, and use of PPE according to current facility policy while in the patient's room. \nVisitors should not be present during aerosol-generating procedures.\nVisitors should be instructed to limit their movement within the facility.\nEstablish policies and procedures for patient placement and transport\nAny patient with respiratory illness consistent with influenza should promptly be asked to wear a facemask for source control, if tolerated, or cover their nose and mouth with tissues when coughing or sneezing, and placed directly in an individual room with the door kept closed, where medically appropriate. The precautions required for entry into patient rooms should be posted on the door. Once placed in rooms, patients with suspected or confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza should be encouraged to practice respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette when they are coughing or sneezing throughout their duration of stay.\n\nWhen a single patient room is not available, consultation with infection control personnel is recommended to assess the risks associated with other patient placement options (e.g., cohorting, keeping the patient with an existing roommate). Morel information on cohorting, including other factors that may affect cohorting decisions Adobe PDF file is available.\nFollow current facility procedures for transport and movement of patients under isolation precautions, including:\nCommunicating information about patients with suspected, probable or confirmed influenza to appropriate personnel before transferring them to other departments in the facility (e.g., radiology, laboratory) and to other facilities.\nLimiting patient transport and movement of patients outside of the room to medically necessary purposes and minimizing waiting times and delays associated with transport and procedures conducted outside the patient\u2019s room.\nProviding influenza patients with facemasks to wear for source control, as tolerated, and tissues to contain secretions when outside of their room.\nEncouraging patients who are able to perform hand hygiene to do so frequently and to follow respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette practices.\nProviding portable x-ray equipment in cohort areas to reduce the need for patient transport.\nLimit the number of healthcare personnel entering the isolation room\nHealthcare personnel entering the room of a patient in isolation should be limited to those truly necessary for performing patient care activities.\nApply isolation precautions\nThe following isolation precautions are recommended for healthcare personnel who are in close contact with patients with suspected or confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza. For the purposes of this document, close contact is defined as working within 6 feet of the patient or entering into a small enclosed airspace shared with the patient (e.g., average patient room):\n\nStandard Precautions - For all patient care, use nonsterile gloves for any contact with potentially infectious material, followed by hand hygiene immediately after glove removal; use gowns along with eye protection for any activity that might generate splashes of respiratory secretions or other infectious material.\nRespiratory Protection \u2013\nRecommendation: CDC continues to recommend the use of respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a fit-tested disposable N95 respirator for healthcare personnel who are in close contact with patients with suspected or confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza. This recommendation applies uniquely to the special circumstances of the current 2009 H1N1 pandemic during the fall and winter of 2009-2010 and CDC will continue to revisit its guidance as new information becomes available, within this season if necessary  \n\nBasis: The current recommendation is based on the unique conditions associated with the current pandemic, including low levels of population immunity to 2009 H1N1 influenza, availability of vaccination programs well after the start of the pandemic, susceptibility to infection of those in the age range of healthcare personnel, increased risk for complications of influenza in some healthcare personnel (e.g., pregnant women), and the potential for healthcare personnel to be exposed to 2009 H1N1 influenza patients because of their occupation.\n\nSupply considerations: CDC recognizes that some facilities are currently experiencing shortages of respiratory protection equipment and that further shortages are anticipated. Although the exact total supply in the public and private sectors is not known, a large gap between supply and demand is predicted. In the face of shortages, appropriate selection and use of respiratory protection is critical. A key strategy is to use source control, engineering, and administrative measures to reduce the numbers of workers who come in contact with patients who have influenza-like illness in order to reduce the consumption of respiratory protection equipment. For example, combining the use of triage procedures and use of partitions or other engineering controls might reduce exposures and the need for PPE.  Other strategies could include taking steps to either reduce consumption of disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators or extend their use.  Some facilities that are experienced in their use may also be able to use alternative PPE for certain applications including more protective filtering facepiece respirators, reusable elastomeric tight-fitting respirators, and reusable powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs).  For facilities that are able to use alternatives such as elastomeric respirators or PAPRs, processes must be in place to ensure that they are used properly and are reliably decontaminated. Additional information about these strategies, including frequently asked questions, are posted on the CDC 2009 H1N1 website.\n\nSpecial care should be taken to ensure that respirators are available for situations where respiratory protection is most important, such as performance of aerosol-generating procedures on patients with suspected or confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza or provision of care to patients with other infections for which respiratory protection is strongly indicated (e.g., tuberculosis).   \n\nPrioritized respirator use: Where a shortage of respirators exists despite reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a sufficient supply for anticipated needs, in particular for very high exposure risk situations such as some aerosol-generating procedures (listed below), a facility should consider shifting to a prioritized respirator use mode. In this mode, respirator use is prioritized to ensure availability for healthcare personnel at most risk from 2009 H1N1 influenza exposure. Even under conditions of prioritized use, personnel attending aerosol-generating procedures on patients with suspected or confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza should always use respiratory protection at least as protective as fitted N95 respirators. An example of prioritization for personnel not attending aerosol-generating procedures is shown in Table 2. Prioritization should be adapted to local conditions and should consider intensity and duration of exposure, personal health risk factors for complications of infection, and vaccination status. When in prioritized respirator use mode, respirator use may be temporarily discontinued for employees at lower risk of exposure to 2009 H1N1 influenza or lower risk of complicated infection. Gathering of personal information for the purposes of pandemic planning and response must be done in a fashion that is compliant with all applicable rules and regulations, including the Americans with DisabilitiesExternal Web Site Icon Act (ADA)External Web Site Icon. Contingency crisis planning is critical to efficient implementation of prioritized use during supply shortages. In making decisions about prioritization, facilities should consider needs for managing patients with diseases other than influenza that require respiratory protection (e.g. tuberculosis) and also considerations related to the timetable for obtaining more respirators. To assure that respirators are likely to be available for the most important uses, facilities should maintain a reserve sufficient to meet the estimated needs for performing aerosol-generating procedures and for managing patients with diseases other than influenza that require respiratory protection until supplies are expected to be replenished. \n\nFacemasks for healthcare personnel who are not provided a respirator due to the implementation of prioritized respirator use: If a facility is in prioritized respirator use mode and unable to provide respirators to healthcare personnel who provide care to suspected and confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza cases, the facility should provide those personnel with facemasks. Facemasks that have been cleared for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have been tested for their ability to resist blood and body fluids, and generally provide a physical barrier to droplets that are expelled directly at the user. Although they do not filter small particles from the air and they allow leakage around the mask, they are a barrier to splashes, droplet sprays, and autoinoculation of influenza virus from the hands to the nose and mouth. Thus, they should be chosen over no protection. Routine chemoprophylaxis is not recommended for personnel wearing facemasks during the care of patients with suspected or confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza.\n\ntop of page\n\nHand Hygiene\n\nHealthcare personnel should perform hand hygiene frequently, including before and after all patient contact, contact with respiratory secretions, and before putting on and upon removal of PPE. Soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizers should be used.\nAerosol-generating procedures\nSome procedures performed on patients are more likely to generate higher concentrations of respiratory aerosols than coughing, sneezing, talking, or breathing, presenting healthcare personnel with an increased risk of exposure to infectious agents present in the aerosol. Although there are limited objective data available on disease transmission related to such aerosols, many authorities view the following procedures as being very high exposure risk aerosol-generating procedures for which special precautions should be used:\n\nBronchoscopy\nSputum induction\nEndotracheal intubation and extubation\nOpen suctioning of airways\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation\nAutopsies\nAlthough some have suggested that administration of nebulized medications (due to risk of inducing cough), acquisition of nasopharyngeal swabs/samples, and use of high-flow oxygen might create infectious aerosols of concern, less is known about the magnitude or potential for exposure.\nA combination of measures should be used to reduce exposures from high-risk aerosol-generating procedures, including:\n\nOnly perform these procedures on patients with suspected or confirmed influenza if they are medically necessary and cannot be postponed.\nLimit the number of healthcare personnel present during the procedure to only those essential for patient care and support.\nConduct the procedures in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) when feasible.  Such rooms are designed to reduce the concentration of infectious aerosols and prevent their escape into adjacent areas using controlled air exchanges and directional airflow. They are single patient rooms at negative pressure relative to the surrounding areas, and with a minimum of 6 air changes per hour (12 air changes per hour are recommended for new construction or renovation). Air from these rooms should be exhausted directly to the outside or be filtered through a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter before recirculation. Room doors should be kept closed except when entering or leaving the room, and entry and exit should be minimized during and shortly after the procedure. Facilities should monitor and document the proper negative-pressure function of these rooms.\nPortable HEPA filtration units may be used to further reduce the concentration of contaminants in the air. Some of these units can connect to local exhaust ventilation systems (e.g. hoods, booths, tents) or have inlet designs that allow close placement to the patient in order to assist with source control; however, these units do not eliminate the need for respiratory protection for individuals entering the room because they may not entrain all of the room air. Information on air flow/air entrainment performance should be evaluated for such devices.\nHealthcare personnel should adhere to standard precautions, and wear respiratory protection equivalent to a fitted N95 filtering facepiece respirator or higher level of protection during aerosol-generating procedures.\nUnprotected healthcare personnel should not be allowed in a room where an aerosol-generating procedure has been conducted until sufficient time has elapsed to remove potentially infectious particles. More information on clearance rates under differing ventilation conditions is available. This table assumes perfect mixing. For example, based on the table, an AIIR with 6 air changes per hour and perfect room mixing will require 46 minutes to reduce the concentration of airborne particles by 99%.  For a more realistic assumption of good mixing, the clearance times provided in this table should be multiplied by a mixing factor of 3. Thus, for an AIIR with 6 air changes per hour and normal room mixing, over two hours will be required to reduce the concentration of airborne particles by 99%). Environmental surface cleaning also is necessary to ensure that environmental contamination does not lead to infection transmission.\nDuration of Isolation Precautions for Patients\nThe recommended duration of isolation precautions for hospitalized patients is longer than that recommended for other populations because duration of virus shedding is likely to be longer than for outpatients with milder illness.  Isolation precautions for patients who have influenza symptoms should be continued for the 7 days after illness onset or until 24 hours after the resolution of fever and respiratory symptoms, whichever is longer, while a patient is in a healthcare facility. Shedding of influenza viruses generally diminishes over the course of 7 days, with transmission apparently correlating with fever. Given this, if isolation resources (e.g. private rooms) become limited, these resources should be prioritized for patients who are earlier in the course of illness. Clinical judgment may be used for patients with only cough as a symptom, since cough after influenza infection may be prolonged and may not be an indicator of viral shedding.  Because some patients with influenza may not have fever but may be shedding influenza virus, patients with any respiratory symptoms should follow hand and respiratory hygiene recommendations, and healthcare personnel working with such patients should continue to follow standard precautions. Patients should be discharged from medical care when clinically appropriate, not based on the period of isolation.\n\nIn some cases, facilities may choose to continue isolation precautions for longer periods such as in the case of young children or severely immunocompromised patients, who may shed influenza virus for longer periods of time and who might be shedding antiviral resistant virus. Clinical judgment should be used to determine the need for continued isolation precautions for such patients. Communications regarding the patient\u2019s diagnosis with post hospital care providers (e.g. Home-healthcare agencies, long-term care facilities) as well as transporting agencies is essential.\n\nMonitor and Manage Ill Healthcare Personnel\nEmployee health services should establish procedures for tracking absences; reviewing job tasks and identifying personnel at higher risk for complications; assuring that employees have access via telephone to medical consultation and, if necessary, early treatment; and promptly identifying individuals with possible influenza. Healthcare personnel should self-assess for symptoms of febrile respiratory illness. An active approach in which personnel are asked daily about symptoms of febrile respiratory illness is also recommended. In most cases, decisions about work restrictions and assignments for personnel with respiratory illness should be guided by clinical signs and symptoms rather than by laboratory testing for influenza. Personnel should be provided with information about risk factors for complications of influenza, so those at higher risk know to promptly seek medical attention and be evaluated for early treatment if they develop symptoms of influenza. All personnel should be provided with specific instructions to follow in the event of respiratory illness with rapid progression, particularly when experiencing shortness of breath. Anyone with the following emergency warning signs needs urgent medical attention and should seek medical care promptly:\n\nDifficulty breathing or shortness of breath\nPain or pressure in the chest or abdomen\nSudden dizziness\nConfusion\nSevere or persistent vomiting\nFlu-like symptoms improve but then return with fever and worse cough\nHealthcare personnel who develop a fever and respiratory symptoms should be:\n\nInstructed not to report to work, or if at work, to promptly notify their supervisor and infection control personnel/occupational health.\nExcluded from work for at least 24 hours after they no longer have a fever, without the use of fever-reducing medicines.\nIf returning to work in areas where severely immunocompromised patients are provided care, considered for temporary reassignment or exclusion from work for 7 days from symptom onset or until the resolution of symptoms, whichever is longer. Clinical judgment should be used for personnel with only cough as a symptom, since cough after influenza infection may be prolonged and may not be an indicator of viral shedding. Healthcare personnel recovering from a respiratory illness may return to work with immunocompromised patients sooner if absence of 2009 H1N1 viral RNA in respiratory secretions is documented by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Additional information on diagnostic testing for 2009 H1N1 influenza infection is available.\nReminded of the importance of practicing frequent hand hygiene (especially before and after each patient contact) and respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette after returning to work following an acute respiratory illness.\nHealthcare personnel who develop acute respiratory symptoms without fever should be:\n\nAllowed to continue or return to work unless assigned in areas where severely immunocompromised patients are provided care. In this case they should be considered for temporary reassignment or exclusion from work for 7 days from symptom onset or until the resolution of symptoms, whichever is longer. Clinical judgment should be used for personnel with only cough as a symptom, since cough after influenza infection may be prolonged and may not be an indicator of viral shedding. Healthcare personnel recovering from a respiratory illness may return to work with immunocompromised patients sooner if absence of 2009 H1N1 viral RNA in respiratory secretions is documented by rRT-PCR. Additional information on diagnostic testing for 2009 H1N1 influenza infection is available.\nReminded of the importance of practicing frequent hand hygiene (especially before and after each patient contact) and respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette after returning to work following an acute respiratory illness.\nFacilities and organizations providing healthcare services should:\nEnsure that sick leave policies for healthcare personnel (e.g., staff and contract personnel) are flexible and consistent with public health guidance and that employees are aware of the policies.\nEnsure that sick employees are able to stay home without fear of losing their jobs.\nConsider offering alternative work environments as an accommodation for employees at higher risk for complications of 2009 H1N1 influenza during periods of increased influenza activity or if influenza severity increases.\nNot require a doctor\u2019s note for workers with influenza to validate their illness or return to work.\nAntiviral Treatment and Chemoprophylaxis of Healthcare Personnel\nPlease refer to the CDC web site for the most current recommendations on the use of antiviral agents for treatment and chemoprophylaxis. All healthcare personnel concerned about symptoms of influenza should seek advice from their medical provider promptly.\n\nTraining and Education of Healthcare Personnel\nAll healthcare personnel should receive training on influenza prevention and risks for complications of influenza. The training should include information on risk assessment; isolation precautions; vaccination protocols; use of engineering and administrative controls and personal protective equipment; protection during high-risk aerosol-generating procedures; signs, symptoms, and complications of influenza; and to promptly seek medical attention for any concerns about symptoms of influenza.\n\nHealthcare Personnel at Higher Risk for Complications of Influenza\nPersonnel at higher risk for complications from influenza infection include pregnant women, persons 65 years old and older, and persons with chronic diseases such as asthma, heart disease, diabetes, diseases that suppress the immune system, and certain other chronic medical conditions. Vaccination and early treatment with antiviral medications are very important for healthcare personnel at higher risk for influenza complications because they can prevent hospitalizations and deaths. Healthcare personnel at higher risk for complications should check with their healthcare provider if they become ill so that they can receive early treatment.\n\ntop of page\n\nEnvironmental Infection Control\nRoutine cleaning and disinfection strategies used during influenza seasons can be applied to the environmental management of 2009 H1N1 influenza.  Management of laundry, utensils and medical waste should also be performed in accordance with procedures followed for seasonal influenza. More information is available. Table 1.

The approach to conserving supplies of N95 respirators can be organized into these broad categories:\n\nMinimize the number of individuals who need to use respiratory protection through the use of engineering and administrative controls;\nUse alternatives to disposable N95 respirators where feasible;\nExtend the use, and consider reuse of disposable N95 respirators; and\nPrioritize the use of N95 respirators for those personnel at highest risk of exposure.\nWhat can healthcare facilities do to minimize the need for disposable N95 respirators?\nIn order to reduce the need for respiratory protection, healthcare facilities should consider implementation of measures to eliminate or reduce exposure to 2009 H1N1 influenza. Such measures can be organized according to infection control principles and a \u201chierarchy of controls\u201d, which prioritizes protective measures based on their likelihood of reducing the risk of exposure. Top priorities in this hierarchy are those measures which can effectively eliminate the source of potential exposure such as measures that prevent visits by ill individuals to healthcare facilities where those can be postponed. Where exposures cannot be eliminated, engineering controls should be considered as the primary means for reducing exposure. Engineering controls physically separate, shield or protect healthcare personnel from the sources of exposure. Examples include the use of partitions and barriers to separate potentially ill patients from well providers or use of closed suctioning systems for airways suction that prevent generation of aerosols. Engineering controls are particularly effective because they can be implemented without placing responsibility on individual employees for implementation. Administrative controls are work practices and policies which are designed to reduce or eliminate hazards, though their effectiveness is dependent on management implementation and personnel adherence. Examples of this include the placing of facemasks on ill individuals for source-control, vaccination of healthcare personnel, and the use of appropriate triage and isolation procedures. Although administrative controls are given lower priority in the classic hierarchy of controls, vaccination of healthcare personnel is particularly effective in that it protects against infections resulting from work, household, and community exposures. The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is for protection from exposures that cannot otherwise be eliminated or controlled. PPE must be used and maintained properly to be effective. The prioritization of protective measures for healthcare personnel according to the hierarchy of controls is a concept that needs to be tailored to the needs, capabilities, and circumstances of each healthcare facility.\n\nFurther detailed recommendations for minimizing risk of 2009 H1N1influenza in healthcare facilities can be found in Table 1 of the Interim Guidance on Infection Control Measures for 2009 H1N1 Influenza in Healthcare Settings, Including Protection of Healthcare Personnel.\n\nWhat options are available to facilities if disposable N95 respirator supplies are insufficient for routine use according to current interim guidance?\nFacilities should eliminate potential exposures, and use engineering and administrative controls to minimize risk of exposure to the 2009 H1N1 virus. This will also reduce the number of personnel using respiratory protection.\n\nHealthcare facilities can consider steps to extend the existing supply of disposable N95 respirators by either training personnel to wear them during serial patient encounters (\u201cextended use,\u201d i.e. without removing or re-donning between encounters) or to re-use them (\u201cre-use,\u201d i.e. removing and re-donning between patient encounters). Although these practices have the potential benefit of providing respiratory protection with limited supplies of respirators, there is the risk of respirator contamination and contact transmission. Either extended use or reuse of disposable N95 respirators could entail a risk of contact transmission by touching a contaminated surface of the respirator and subsequently touching the mucous membranes of the face or a hypothetical risk of re-aerosolization of virus from a used respirator. The precise balance between risk of contact transmission and benefit of extended use or re-use associated with this strategy is unknown, although the risk will be minimized if HCWs perform hand hygiene every time before and after touching the respirator. In general, if either of those options is chosen, wearing an N95 respirator over multiple encounters (while minimizing touching, removing, or re-donning between encounters) would be favored over re-use, as this strategy is expected to involve less touching of the respirator and therefore less risk of contact transmission. (See questions on extended use and re-use). Disposable N95 respirators worn during aerosol-generating procedures should be discarded after the procedure.\n\nAnother option to consider is use of respirators other than disposable N95 respirators.\n\nWhen a shortage of respirators exists despite reasonable efforts to obtain or extend a supply for anticipated needs, facilities should consider shifting to prioritized respirator use mode. In this mode, respirator use is prioritized to protect healthcare personnel at greatest risk of 2009 H1N1 influenza exposure or who care for patients with other diseases such as tuberculosis that require respiratory protection.  Prioritization should be adapted to local conditions.  In making decisions about prioritization, facilities should consider needs for performing aerosol-generating procedures and for managing patients with diseases other than influenza that require respiratory protection.  To assure that respirators are likely to be available for the most important uses, facilities should maintain a reserve sufficient to meet the estimated needs for performing aerosol-generating procedures and for managing patients with diseases other than influenza that require respiratory protection until supplies are expected to be replenished.\n\nAt a minimum, any individuals attending aerosol-generating procedures should use respiratory protection at least as protective as fit-tested N95 respirators. When a shortage of respirators exists, respirator use can be temporarily discontinued for employees providing routine patient care who are not at high risk of complicated infection. Prioritization should consider intensity and duration of exposure, individual worker health risk factors for complications of infection, and vaccination status. An example of prioritization for personnel not attending aerosol-generating procedures is shown in Table 2 in \u201cInterim Guidance on Infection Control Measures for 2009 H1N1 Influenza in Healthcare Settings, Including Protection of Healthcare Personnel\u201d.\n\nWhen respirator use for personnel who are not at high risk of complicated infection is temporarily discontinued during prioritized respirator use mode, those personnel should be provided with facemasks. Although facemasks do not filter particles from the air and allow air leakage around the edges, they are an effective barrier to splashes, droplet sprays, and autoinoculation of influenza virus from the hands to the nose and mouth. Thus, they should be chosen over no protection. Detailed information on prioritized respirator use can be found in Interim Guidance on Infection Control Measures for 2009 H1N1 Influenza in Healthcare Settings, Including Protection of Healthcare Personnel.\n\nRoutine chemoprophylaxis is not indicated for personnel wearing facemasks during the care of patients with suspected or confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza.\n\nWhat other respirators can be used to reduce dependence on disposable N95 respirators?\nOther classes of disposable respirators (e.g., N99s, N100s), which are similar in design and shape to N95s, can be considered. Alternatives to disposable respirators, such as powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs), or elastomeric half-mask and full facepiece respirators, can also be considered, especially in settings such as procedure rooms (e.g. bronchoscopy suites) where higher-risk activities such as aerosol-generating procedures are intermittently performed, and in facilities that have prior experience with these respirators (see questions below on PAPRs and elastomerics, provide link). More information on respirators is available at: \"NIOSH Safety and Health Topic: Respirators\".\n\nIs extended use over multiple patient encounters an appropriate strategy for extending supplies of respiratory protection?\nExtended use refers to wearing disposable N95 respirators for serial patient encounters, where the respirator has not been removed and re-donned between encounters. This practice may result in a risk of contact transmission by touching a contaminated surface of the respirator and subsequently touching the mucous membranes of the face.   The precise balance between risk of contact transmission and benefit of extended use associated with this strategy is unknown, although the risk will be minimized if HCWs perform hand hygiene every time before and after touching the respirator. Extended use would be favored over re-use, because it is expected to involve less touching of the respirator and face. (See questions on extended use and re-use) Consultation with the facility's infection control experts should be sought in making decisions regarding the most appropriate and feasible personal protective equipment to protect workers from influenza if required by respirator shortages. If extended use practices are implemented as a means to extend respirator supplies, measures should be taken to reduce contact transmission, including:\n\nDiscarding disposable N95 respirators following use during aerosol generating procedures.\nDiscarding disposable N95 respirators if contaminated with blood, respiratory secretions, or other bodily fluids from patients.\nConsidering use of a face shield over the disposable N95 respirator to prevent surface contamination.\nPerforming hand hygiene before and after touching the respirator. \nExtended use may be most practical in selected practice settings where serial contact with multiple suspected or confirmed 2009 H1N1 patients might fit naturally into the workflow (e.g. such as triaging multiple patients in admissions and on dedicated wards for 2009 H1N1 patients). Additional training of personnel will be needed if this alternative is considered for implementation.\n\ntop of page\n\nCan respirators be re-used to help extend the existing supply?\nRe-use of disposable N95 respirators, where the respirator is removed and re-donned between patient encounters, can result in a risk of contact transmission by touching a contaminated surface of the respirator and subsequently touching the mucous membranes of the face. The precise balance between risk of contact transmission and benefit of re-use associated with this strategy is unknown, although the risk will be minimized if HCWs perform hand hygiene every time before and after touching the respirator. However, in general, extended use (i.e. wearing over multiple encounters while minimizing touching, removing, or re-donning between encounters) would be favored over re-use because it is expected to involve less touching of the respirator and face. (See questions on extended use). Consultation with the facility's infection control experts should be sought in making decisions regarding the most appropriate and feasible personal protective equipment to protect workers from influenza if required by respirator shortages. If re-use is chosen as a strategy to increase availability of respiratory protection, the following should be considered to minimize risk of transmission:\n\nDiscard disposable N95 respirators following aerosol-generating procedures.\nDiscard disposable N95 respirators contaminated with blood, respiratory or nasal secretions, or other bodily fluids from patients.\nDisposable respirators must only be used and re-used by a single wearer. \nDo not re-use a disposable respirator that is obviously contaminated, damaged or hard to breathe through.\nConsider use of a face shield over a disposable N95 respirator to prevent surface contamination.\nStore the respirator in a clean, breathable container such as a paper bag between uses.\nAvoid touching the inside of the respirator.\nWearer should perform hand hygiene with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer before and after touching a used respirator.\nConsultation with the facility\u2019s infection control experts and training of healthcare personnel will be needed if this alternative is being considered for implementation.\n\nHow long can a disposable N-95 respirator be used?\nKey considerations in safe extended use and re-use of a disposable N-95 respirator over time are that the respirator must maintain its fit and function; and it must not acquire potentially hazardous microbial contamination.  It is not currently possible to specify a longest safe duration of disposable N-95 respirator use.   There are two reasons for this.  First, published research data to adequately answer the question does not exist.  Second, safe duration of use can be affected by a number of variables that impact on respirator function and acquisition of contamination over time.  Examples include frequency of use, intensity of potentially contaminating exposures, practices used to prevent contamination, and the range of materials and methods used to manufacture different models of disposable N95 respirators.  Depending on the respirator model, components such as elastic straps and nosepieces might hold up very differently over time.\n\nAssuming that the practices recommended in the sections on extended use  and re-use above are carefully followed, there is extensive experience in industrial settings, including very dusty settings, indicating that 8 hours of continuous or intermittent use is a safe duration from the standpoint of respirator function.  Considerably longer durations of good function would be expected in clean, non-dusty environments such as healthcare settings, with replacement guided by considerations of hygiene, damage, and breathing resistance.  However, it should be recognized that wearing a malfunctioning respirator (such as one with a stretched out elastic strap that no longer holds tight or a broken nosepiece) may create a false sense of security and be more dangerous than not wearing a respirator at all.  Thus, if disposable respirators are to be used over time, they must be carefully and regularly inspected and properly used and stored, as described in the sections on extended use and re-use above.  As part of a facility\u2019s comprehensive respiratory protection program, policies and procedures guiding disposable N95 respirator inspection, usage, storage, and replacement should be documented in writing and presented to workers as part of their training, at least annually.\nWhat should be recommended for facilities that can only obtain models of disposable N95 respirators for which their personnel have not been fit-tested?\nIn settings where sufficient supplies of disposable N95 respirators are available, they must be used in accordance with a comprehensive respiratory protection program, which includes fit testing, training, and medical clearance (see OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.134External Web Site Icon. Healthcare personnel conducting the highest exposure risk activities (i.e., aerosol-generating procedures) should only wear fit-tested N-95 respirators. Using disposable N95 respirators that have not been fit tested does not provide the same assurance of respiratory protection as ones that are fit-tested because some individuals may have poor fit. Normally, a requirement for use of any NIOSH approved respirator, including disposable N95 respirators, is that the respirator be selected, fitted, used, and maintained in accordance with OSHA and other applicable regulations. However, in the context of supply limitations during the current pandemic, non-fit-tested disposable N95 respirators can be considered for personnel at lower risk of exposure or lower risk of complications from influenza until fit testing can be completed. This use will provide protection from droplets and splatter, as would facemasks, but also will provide some additional protection against small particle aerosols. Personnel using the replacement, non-fit-tested disposable N95 respirators should receive training on use of the model being used. Facilities should fit-test workers with the new model of disposable N95 respirator as soon as possible, beginning with those staff who are assigned to duties that involve higher-risk exposure. (refer to Table 2 in main guidance for relative risks of different activities)\n\nIn what settings could powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) be considered as an alternative to disposable N95 respirators?\nOne alternative for respiratory protection of healthcare personnel in settings when disposable N95 respirators are unavailable or in short supply is the powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR).  Some healthcare facilities and personnel have accumulated experience with these devices, most commonly in settings such as procedure rooms (e.g. bronchoscopy suites) and in certain laboratory settings. PAPRs have the advantages of being more protective than N-95 respirators and the hooded designs can be worn with facial hair and do not require fit testing.  PAPRs can also be cleaned and disinfected for reuse as indicated by manufacturers\u2019 instructions. Cleaning and disinfection procedures must be compatible with clinical use.\n\nPAPRs can interfere with important patient care activities such as using a stethoscope to listen to patients\u2019 heart or lungs.  Thus, PAPRs are not a practical option for use in many patient care settings.  However, their use in even limited situations, such as aerosol-generating procedures, would increase the supply of disposable N95 respirators for other uses.\n\nIn what settings could elastomeric respirators be considered an alternative to disposable N95 respirators?\nElastomeric half-mask and full facepiece respirators with N95 or higher particulate filters can be considered as options for respiratory protection of healthcare personnel in certain settings where N95 respirators are not available. While there is little accumulated experience with their use in patient care settings, they do offer some advantages over disposable N95 respirators, including greater durability and their ability to be cleaned and re-used by the same user or by multiple users. In addition, full facepiece respirators offer a greater level of respiratory protection, as well as eye protection. Disadvantages in healthcare settings include the lack of healthcare personnel experienced in their use; the need for devices to be routinely inspected, cleaned, and disinfected; interference with communication with patients and coworkers and the presence of exhalation valves precluding their use in sterile fields. Effective communication with patients and other personnel is also generally limited when wearing these devices. Although elastomeric respirators may not be a practical option for use in many patient care settings, their use even in limited situations, such as aerosol-generating procedures and in clinical laboratory settings would increase the supply of disposable N95 respirators for other uses.\n\nWhere can I find more information on the various types of respirators?\nInformation on all types of respirators is available at: \"NIOSH Safety and Health Topic: Respirators\". A listing of all NIOSH-approved disposable respirators is available at \"NIOSH-Approved Particulate Filtering Facepiece Respirators\".\n\nCan \u201cindustrial N95 respirators\u201d be used when splashes or sprays of potentially infectious body fluids are anticipated?\nNIOSH-certified \u201cindustrial N95 respirators\u201d for protection against particulate aerosols (liquids as well as solids) fall into two groups: disposable N95 respirators and reusable elastomeric respirators (either half face or full face).  These respirators have not been cleared as medical devices by FDA.  They should not be used as \u201csurgical respirators\u201d in situations where a sterile field is required (e.g. during an invasive procedure in an operating or procedure room).\n\nDepending on if they are disposable N95 respirators or reusable elastomeric respirators, different approaches should be taken to using these two types of \u201cindustrial N95 respirators\u201d as personal protective equipment in settings where splashes or sprays of potentially infectious body fluids are anticipated. \n\nDisposable N95 respirators not cleared as medical devices by FDA have not generally been evaluated against the test standard recommended for fluid resistance determination for medical masks.  Healthcare personnel who use these respirators in settings where splashes or sprays of body fluids are expected should wear a face shield over the disposable N95 respirator to assure protection against fluid penetration.  The face shield will also provide the eye protection that is required in this situation.\n\nThe facepieces of reusable elastomeric respirators are constructed of natural or synthetic rubber, materials that are far more fluid resistant than the filter materials used in making disposable N95 respirators or medical masks.  Half facepiece reusable elastomeric respirators do not provide eye protection.  Therefore, healthcare personnel using them in situations where fluid splashes or sprays are expected should also wear eye protection (such as goggles or a face shield).  Full facepiece reusable elastomeric respirators provide both respiratory and eye protection.  Thus, when they are used, additional eye protection is not necessary.",

            "Text": "Are the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccines safe?\nThe 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine is showing a similar safety profile to seasonal flu vaccines, which have a very good safety track record. Over the years, hundreds of millions of Americans have received seasonal flu vaccines. The most common side effects following flu vaccinations are mild, such as soreness, redness, tenderness or swelling where the shot was given. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are closely monitoring for any signs that the vaccine is causing unexpected adverse events and are working with state and local health officials and other public health partners to investigate any unusual events.\nAre there any side effects to the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine?\nThe 2009 H1N1 vaccine is made the same way as seasonal flu vaccines. Millions of seasonal flu vaccines have been given safely. Millions of people have also safely received the 2009 H1N1 vaccine. CDC expects that any side effects following vaccination with the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine would be rare. Any side effects that have occurred since people started receiving the 2009 H1N1 vaccine have been similar to those experienced following seasonal influenza vaccine. Mild problems that may be experienced include soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given, fainting (mainly adolescents), headache, muscle aches, fever, and nausea. If these problems occur, they usually begin soon after the shot and last 1-2 days. Life-threatening allergic reactions to vaccines are very rare. If they do occur, it is usually within a few minutes to a few hours after the shot is given.\n\nAfter vaccination you should look for any unusual condition, such as a high fever or behavior changes. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, swelling around the eyes or lips, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness. If any unusual condition occurs following vaccination, seek medical attention right away. Tell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your doctor, nurse, or health department to report the reaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form. Or you can file this report yourself through the VAERS WebsiteExternal Web Site Icon. You may call 1-800-822-7967 to receive a copy of the VAERS form. VAERS is not able to provide medical advice.\n\ntop of page\n\nA complete list of possible side effects from both the flu shot and the nasal spray (LAIV or Flu Mist) vaccines are below:\n\nThe flu shot: The viruses in the flu shot are killed (inactivated), so you cannot get the flu from a flu shot. Some minor side effects that could occur are:\n\nSoreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given\nFever (low grade)\nAches\nNausea\nIf these problems occur, they begin soon after the shot and usually last 1 to 2 days. Almost all people who receive influenza vaccine have no serious problems from it. However, on rare occasions, flu vaccination can cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. A federal program has been created to help pay for the medical care and other specific expenses of certain persons who have a serious reaction to this vaccine. For more information about this program, call 1-888-275-4772 or visit the program\u2019s website at: \"Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program\"External Web Site Icon.\n\nThe nasal spray (also called LAIV): The viruses in the nasal-spray vaccine are weakened and do not cause severe symptoms often associated with influenza illness. (In clinical studies, transmission of vaccine viruses to close contacts has occurred only rarely.)\n\nIn children, side effects from LAIV can include:\n\nrunny nose\nwheezing\nheadache\nvomiting\nmuscle aches\nfever\nIn adults, side effects from LAIV can include\n\nrunny nose\nheadache\nsore throat\ncough\ntop of page\n\nAre there some people who should not receive this vaccine?\nPeople who have a severe (life-threatening) allergy to chicken eggs or to any other substance in the vaccine should not be vaccinated.\n\nHow will the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccines be monitored for safety?\nThe CDC and FDA closely monitor the safety of seasonal influenza and other vaccines licensed for use in the United States in cooperation with state and local health departments, healthcare providers, and other partners.\n\nThe purpose of vaccine safety monitoring is timely identification of clinically significant adverse events following immunization that may be of public health concern. Adverse events, or possible side effects, following immunization may be coincidental to (meaning occurring around the same time but not related to vaccination) or caused by vaccination.\n\nCDC and its partners use multiple systems to monitor the safety of 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine. Two of the primary systems that are being used to monitor the safety of these vaccines are: the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which is jointly operated with FDA, and the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) Project.\n\ntop of page\n\nVaccine Adverse Event Report System (VAERS)\nVAERS is a national program managed by both CDC and FDA to monitor the safety of all vaccines licensed in the United States. Anyone can file a VAERS report. VAERS relies on information included in these reports to monitor for clinically serious adverse events or health problems that follow vaccination. Healthcare providers are encouraged to voluntarily report possible adverse events of concern after vaccination, even if they are not certain that the vaccine caused the event. Generally, VAERS cannot determine if an adverse event was caused by a vaccine but can help determine if further investigations are needed. FDA and CDC use VAERS data to help identify potential clinically serious vaccine adverse events or health outcomes. If concerns are identified in VAERS, usually further investigation is needed. One important system used to further evaluate concerns identified in VAERS is the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) Project. More information about VAERSExternal Web Site Icon is available.\nVaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) Project\nThe VSD Project is a vaccine safety system used to both identify and confirm adverse outcomes after immunization. This project is a collaboration between CDC and eight large managed care organizations, in which comprehensive medical information is collected on approximately 9 million people. The VSD project monitors their data weekly for certain adverse events that could be associated with newly licensed vaccines. VSD conducts studies of vaccine safety adverse events and health outcomes that may arise with any vaccine.\nAdditionally, CDC works with numerous partners, including other federal agencies, state and local health departments, professional organizations, and academic institutions, to actively follow individuals after vaccination to monitor for any potential adverse events.\n\ntop of page\n\nDo the 2009 H1N1 vaccines contain adjuvants?\nNo. Only unadjuvanted vaccines are being used in the United States during the 2009 flu season. This includes all of the 2009 H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccines that are available for children and adults in both the injectable and nasal spray formulations. None of these influenza vaccines contain adjuvants.\n\n2009 H1N1 vaccines with adjuvants are being studied to determine if they are safe and effective. Experts will review these data when they are available.  There is no plan at this time to recommend a 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine with an adjuvant.\n\nDo the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccines contain thimerosal?\nFDA licensed (approved) several formulations ofthe 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccines, including multi-dose vials and single-dose units. Multi-dose vials contain thimerosal as a preservative to prevent potential contamination after the vial is opened.\n\nSome vaccine manufacturers are producing 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccines in single-dose units, which do not require the use of thimerosal as a preservative. In addition, the live-attenuated version of the vaccine, which is administered intranasally (through the nose), is produced in single-units and does not contain thimerosal. More information on thimerosal.\n\ntop of page\n\nDo the benefits of the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccines outweigh the risks? Is this something I should talk to my healthcare provider about?\nVaccination is the best way to prevent influenza infection and its complications. This is the reason that CDC, national health organizations, and healthcare providers intensively promote vaccination for seasonal influenza, and the reason why so much work was done to have a vaccine available for the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus.\n\nSeasonal influenza vaccines are highly effective in preventing influenza disease. The vaccines against 2009 H1N1 influenza are expected to work in a similar fashion to the seasonal influenza vaccines. CDC and FDA believe that the benefits of vaccination with the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine far outweigh the risks.\n\nCurrently the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus (sometimes called \u201cswine flu\u201d) seems to be causing serious health outcomes for:\n\nhealthy young people from birth through age 24*\npregnant women\nadults 25 to 64 who have underlying medical conditions\n* Children, especially those younger than 5 years of age and those who have high risk medical conditions are at increased risk of influenza-related complications. For a more detailed description of children at highest risk, read Children with Developmental Disabilities and Chronic Medical Conditions. For information about pediatric morbidity, read the Surveillance for Pediatric Deaths Associated with 2009 H1N1 Influenza.\n\nInfluenza vaccines do not protect against other viruses that cause respiratory illnesses. Even after you are vaccinated, it is still important to wash your hands well and often, to cover your coughs and sneezes, and to stay home if you are sick.\n\nCDC and FDA encourage you to ask your healthcare provider any questions you have about the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine and the seasonal influenza vaccines. Your healthcare provider is an excellent source for information on the benefits and risks of vaccination for protection against 2009 H1N1 influenza for you, your children, and other family members.\n\nCDC is working continuously to provide the public with the most current information about 2009 H1N1 influenza and the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine and its safety.\n\ntop of page\n\nIs there a possibility of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) cases following the 2009 H1N1 vaccine?\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is a rare disease in which the body damages its own nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. It is not fully understood why some people develop GBS, but it is believed that stimulation of the body\u2019s immune system may play a role in its development. Infection with the bacterium Campylobacter jejuni, which can cause diarrhea, is one of the most common risk factors for GBS. People can also develop GBS after having the flu or other infections (such as cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr virus). On very rare occasions, they may develop GBS in the days or weeks following receiving a vaccination.\n\nIn 1976, there was a small risk of GBS following influenza (swine flu) vaccination (approximately 1 additional case per 100,000 people who received the swine flu vaccine). That number of GBS cases was slightly higher than what is normally seen in the population, whether or not people were vaccinated. Since then, numerous studies have been done to evaluate if other flu vaccines were associated with GBS. In most studies, no association was found, but two studies suggested that approximately 1 additional person out of 1 million vaccinated people may be at risk for GBS associated with the seasonal influenza vaccine. FDA and CDC are closely monitoring reports of serious problems following the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccines, including GBS. vaccine safety?\nIn addition to talking openly with your healthcare providers, CDC encourages you to stay informed by checking the following web sites often for the most up-to-date news and information: Vaccine Safety,",

            "HeadLine": "Questions and Answers on 2009 H1N1 Vaccine Financing",
            "Text": "General Financing Questions\nConsiderations of financing distinguish between those related to the vaccine itself, the ancillary supplies needed to administer the vaccine, and the actual administration of the vaccine. \n\nHow will the 2009 H1N1 vaccine be financed?\nIn general, the 2009 H1N1 vaccine will be financed similarly to seasonal influenza vaccine, with two important exceptions.  First, the federal government has purchased the vaccine and related supplies so providers should not be seeking reimbursement for these.  Second, states are receiving funding from CDC to coordinate vaccination efforts.  Vaccine administration can be billed to public and private insurance in much of the same way that they currently are billed for the seasonal influenza vaccine.  In no case will commercial community vaccinators be permitted to receive both federal monies provided to public health departments and bill insurance for vaccine administration for the same patient.  Details are below, but in summary, the 2009 H1N1 vaccine will be financed similarly to the seasonal influenza vaccine.\n\nCan vaccination providers charge or bill for the 2009 H1N1 vaccine?\nNo. 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine and ancillary supplies (syringes, needles, sharps containers, and alcohol swabs) have been purchased by the federal government and provided free of charge to all providers participating in this voluntary vaccination effort. Therefore, it will not be permissible to charge for the 2009 H1N1 vaccine itself.\n\nCan vaccination providers charge or bill for administration of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine to patients?\nYes. While every effort is being made to ensure that cost is not a barrier for patient receipt of vaccine, providers may charge or bill for vaccine administration. Policies and procedures guiding this financial transaction are explained below.\n\nWhat types of providers can administer the 2009 H1N1 vaccine?\nAny public or private provider who is designated as a 2009 H1N1 vaccinator by the public health authority in the jurisdiction where they practice can participate in the 2009 H1N1 vaccination program. In addition to physicians, private providers may include commercial community vaccinators (CCV) such as pharmacies, retail-based clinics, urgent care centers, and medical services firms. Public providers may include state and local health departments and Health Centers (HCs), including any federally qualified health center (FQHC) whether public or private.\n\nTo become a designated 2009 H1N1 vaccinator, providers should contact the appropriate person in their state health department for more information (http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/vaccination/statecontacts.htm). It is not necessary to be a registered Vaccines for Children (VFC) provider in order to participate in the 2009 H1N1 vaccination program.\n\nPublic Health Departments\nCan federal funds provided to public health departments for 2009 H1N1 vaccine implementation be used to pay for the administration of vaccines given by commercial community vaccinators?\nYes. Federal funds have been awarded for vaccine campaigns in accordance with state plans and the terms and conditions of the grant award. Providers should contact their state health departments for the specifics of the vaccination campaign in each state. In no case will commercial community vaccinators (CCVs, as defined above) be permitted to receive both federal monies provided to public health departments and bill insurance for vaccine administration for the same patient. It is the responsibility of the designated public health authority to oversee this policy. Following the 2009 H1N1 vaccination campaign, HHS will conduct an assessment to determine how this process was followed.\n\nBy what mechanisms may public health departments use federal implementation funds to pay for the administration of 2009 H1N1 vaccines given by commercial community vaccinators?\nWhen a contract exists between the commercial community vaccinator and the public health department, the public health department can organize a 2009 H1N1 vaccination clinic using the contracted CCV to provide staff or to run the clinic. The public health department may use 2009 H1N1 vaccine implementation funds provided by the federal government to pay the CCV. Alternatively, the public health department may organize and establish a mass vaccination site and identify a CCV to administer vaccine at that site. In this case, a health department may use federal funds to pay the CCV, or the CCV can bill third party payers, including Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance plans.\n\nPrivate Health Insurance\nWill private health insurance plans reimburse private providers for administration of 2009 H1N1 vaccine?\nThis is up to each individual health plan, but the general expectation is that plans will reimburse for vaccine administration.  According to America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a national association representing nearly 1,300 companies that provide health insurance to over 200 million Americans,  \u201cEvery year health plans contribute to the seasonal flu vaccination campaign in several ways:\n\na) Health plans communicate directly with plan sponsors and members about the current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations and encourage immunization; they also provide information on where to get vaccinations, and who to contact with any questions.\n\nb) Just as health plans have provided extensive coverage for the administration of seasonal flu vaccines in the past, public health planners can make the assumption that health plans will provide reimbursement for the administration of 2009 H1N1 vaccine to their members by private sector providers in both traditional settings e.g., doctor\u2019s office, ambulatory clinics, health care facilities, and in non-traditional settings, where contracts with insurers have been established.\u201d\n\nWhat Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes are available for submitting a claim for administration of 2009 H1N1 vaccine to a private health insurance plan?\nThe currently established CPT code for 2009 H1N1 vaccine is 90663 (influenza virus vaccine, pandemic formulation, H1N1). This code may be reported in conjunction with the unique CPT code for H1N1 vaccine administration:  90470, H1N1 immunization administration (intramuscular, intranasal), including counseling when performed. Providers should follow instructions provided by the health plans with whom they contract related to billing for 2009 H1N1 vaccine administration.\n\ntop of page\n\nMedicare Fee for Service (FFS)\nWill Medicare FFS pay private providers for administration of 2009 H1N1 vaccine?\nYes, like the seasonal influenza vaccine, the 2009 H1N1 vaccine and its administration are covered under the Part B preventive services benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries with Part B coverage. For details on Medicare coverage and reimbursement for 2009 H1N1 vaccine, see Medicare Fee-for-Services (MFFS) Billing for the Administration of the Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Vaccine Adobe PDF fileExternal Web Site Icon.\n\nWill Medicare FFS pay for multiple administration fees if it is determined that the 2009 H1N1 vaccine requires multiple doses?\nIt is expected that persons aged 10 and over only require one dose of 2009 H1N1 vaccine. However, multiple administration fees will be covered for Medicare beneficiaries requiring multiple doses of H1N1 vaccine.\n\nWhat type of cost-sharing for 2009 H1N1 vaccine administration will be imposed on Medicare FFS beneficiaries?\nFor Medicare FFS beneficiaries, co-insurance and deductible requirements are not applied to influenza vaccine administration, including 2009 H1N1.\n\nHow much will Medicare FFS pay for administration of 2009 H1N1 vaccine?\nMedicare FFS will reimburse the administration of 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine at the same rate that is paid for administration of seasonal influenza vaccine, for each dose administered.\n\nWhat codes should be used when submitting a claim for 2009 H1N1 vaccine administration to Medicare FFS?\nCMS has established two new Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes for 2009 H1N1 vaccine and vaccine administration: G9141- Influenza A (H1N1) immunization administration (includes the physician counseling the patient/family), and G9142- Influenza A (H1N1) vaccine, any route of administration.\n\nProviders may elect to submit the HCPCS code for the 2009 H1N1 vaccine along with the vaccine administration code. However, since Medicare FFS will not provide payment for the 2009 H1N1 vaccine itself, only the vaccine administration code is required for payment.\n\nWill Medicare pay for 2009 H1N1 vaccine administration in a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) or Rural Health Clinic (RHC)?\nYes. Medicare will pay 100% of the administration cost, through the cost report. These costs will appear on the applicable cost report for the cost reporting period for which the H1N1 vaccine was administered.\n\nWill Medicare cover 2009 H1N1 vaccine administered by a physician in a setting such as a pharmacy or a grocery store?\nYes. Influenza vaccinations can be provided in a wide range of locations. Physicians must enroll with the Medicare carrier or Medicare Administrative Contractor that processes claims for the area where the service is performed.\n\nCan mass immunizers roster bill Medicare for administration of 2009 H1N1 vaccine?\nYes. Seasonal influenza mass immunizers and roster billers may submit 2009 H1N1 administration claims using the roster billing format. The same information must be captured for the 2009 H1N1 administration roster claims as it is for the seasonal influenza roster claims.\n\ntop of page\n\nMedicaid and CHIP (Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program)\nWill Medicaid/CHIP pay for administration of 2009 H1N1 vaccine?\nMedicaid will pay for administration of 2009 H1N1 vaccine to all Medicaid-enrolled children under the age of 21. Administration of 2009 H1N1 vaccine to all children covered by separate state CHIP programs will also be paid for by Medicaid. For adults in the Medicaid program, 2009 H1N1 vaccine administration is a covered service when furnished by a participating provider under the mandatory section 1905(a) Medicaid benefit. Since hospital, physician and federally qualified health center/rural health clinic (FQHC/RHC) services are mandatory Medicaid benefits, 2009 H1N1 vaccine administration would be a covered service when provided by these participating providers.\n\nWhat type of cost-sharing for 2009 H1N1 vaccine administration will be imposed on Medicaid/CHIP beneficiaries?\nThe following categories of beneficiaries are exempt from copayments: pregnant women; children under 18; patients in a hospital, nursing facility, or intermediate care facility/mentally retarded; and terminally ill patients receiving hospice care.  States can impose nominal copayments on other beneficiaries.  Approximately 27 states require some cost sharing for adult immunizations.  However, CMS is encouraging states that currently impose copayments for services required for prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of the 2009 H1N1 influenza (e.g., vaccine administrations or treatment of 2009 H1N1 influenza as part of an office visit to a physician or other provider type) to submit state plan amendments (SPAs) to exclude services related to 2009 H1N1 influenza from copayments. \n\nCopayments and other out-of-pocket charges should not be collected in public health clinics. More information is available at H1N1 Vaccine Administration Billing Q & As.\n\nHow much will Medicaid/CHIP pay for administration of 2009 H1N1 vaccine?\nMedicaid and CHIP payments for administration of 2009 H1N1 vaccine will be similar to payments for other vaccines given to Medicaid beneficiaries. These payments are determined by each state Medicaid program, and vary by state.\n\nWill Medicaid pay for 2009 H1N1 vaccine administered in a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) or Rural Health Clinic (RHC)?\nYes. FQHCs and RHCs services are mandatory Medicaid benefits, so 2009 H1N1 vaccine administration provided by these participating providers is a covered service. Medicaid FQHC and RHC payment methodologies and payment rates vary across states. CMS will then match the state's expenditure at the appropriate matching rate.\n\nCan mass immunizers roster bill Medicaid for administration of 2009 H1N1 vaccine?\nRoster billing is not precluded under federal law, and there are States that have been accepting roster billing for other immunizations, mainly in the context of nursing facilities.  Each state has its own billing rules/requirements. States have been encouraged by CMS to allow providers to \u201croster bill\u201d for vaccines, which would allow providers to submit one claim identifying all eligible Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries that receive the 2009 H1N1 vaccine on a given day. Roster billing may be useful for providers conducting school-located vaccination clinics or other types of mass vaccination clinics.\n\nWill 2009 H1N1 vaccination in a setting such as a pharmacy or a grocery store be covered by Medicaid?\nTo the extent that States have not done so already, States are encouraged to expand coverage for vaccine administration to a range of providers and settings, including non-traditional care sites, in order to efficiently and effectively provide vaccinations to large numbers of Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries. These could include walk-in clinics at retail stores/outlets/pharmacies and school-based health centers/clinics. Other ways for States to consider expanding their capacity to cover/provide mass vaccinations would be to establish clinics under physician direction at schools. Note that Federal requirements pertaining to clinic services at 42 CFR 440.90 require that services be provided \u201cunder the direction of a physician.\u201d Physician direction can be met, in the case of vaccinations, through standing orders provided by the physician or other forms/mechanisms of indirect physician direction/supervision where the physician is not necessarily on-site. The physician must, however, assume professional responsibility for the service/vaccinations provided by those under his/her direction and be readily available for direction/consultation.\n\nDepending on the State\u2019s current State Medicaid or CHIP plan, a state plan amendment (SPA) may be required to effectuate some of these options to expand provision of and access to 2009 H1N1 vaccinations. CMS will assure that such SPAs are acted upon promptly and expeditiously.\n\ntop of page\n\nWhat is Medicaid\u2019s role in 2009 H1N1 vaccine administration?\nCMS recently issued guidance to States outlining existing Medicaid and CHIP authorities available to States for the administration of 2009 H1N1 vaccine. States should consult the guidance at the following link to address concerns that may arise regarding Medicaid and 2009 H1N1 vaccine administration: \"State Health Official Letters\"External Web Site Icon\n\nWhat should State Medicaid programs do with regard to the new H1N1 codes that have recently been published?\nFour new codes plus one revised code were recently published and are available for use by providers and health insurers in submitting/reimbursing claims for H1N1-related services. These codes become part of the standard medical code sets which are used by providers and health insurers, public and private, in transacting electronic medical claims under HIPAA. Two new G-HCPCS codes were published, effective September 1, 2009. Both codes, G9141 for H1N1 immunization administration and G9142 for H1N1 vaccine, were added to Medicare\u2019s October 2009 update of their physician fee schedule. Effective September 28, 2009, CPT created new code 90470 for H1N1 immunization and revised code 90663 to read \u201cInfluenza virus vaccine, pandemic formulation, H1N1.\u201d Also, effective October 1, 2009 a new ICD-9-CM diagnosis code was established for H1N1 (488.1).\n\nThese new and revised codes will enable State Medicaid agencies and their providers to identify, track and transact claims specifically for H1N1-related services. We recognize that it takes time and funding to notify providers and make the appropriate system changes to accommodate these new codes, but we strongly encourage States to use these codes to identify, track and transact claims for these services.\n\nVA\nWill the VA cover administration of 2009 H1N1 vaccine for Veterans eligible for VA health care benefits?\nYes, the VA will provide the 2009 H1N1 vaccine to Veterans who are enrolled in the VA health care system. There will be no charge to eligible Veterans for administration of H1N1 vaccine. Veterans seeking the H1N1 vaccine but currently not enrolled in VA health care can apply for enrollment at their closest VA health care facility, or online at: \"Application for Medical Benefits\"External Web Site Icon\n\nTRICARE\nWill TRICARE cover administration of 2009 H1N1 vaccine for its beneficiaries?\nYes, TRICARE will cover the 2009 H1N1 vaccine for TRICARE beneficiaries.  This coverage applies to beneficiaries served both in Military Treatment Facilities and in private provider offices that are authorized to treat TRICARE beneficiaries.\n\nWhat type of cost-sharing for 2009 H1N1 vaccine administration will be imposed on TRICARE beneficiaries?\nCost-sharing for 2009 H1N1 vaccine administration will be similar to cost-sharing for other vaccines covered by TRICARE. This cost-sharing may vary depending on what type of TRICARE coverage the beneficiary has. TRICARE beneficiaries should consult their benefits guide for cost-sharing information.\n\nWhat codes should be used when submitting a claim for administration of 2009 H1N1 vaccine to TRICARE?\nThe currently established CPT code for 2009 H1N1 vaccine is 90663 (influenza virus vaccine, pandemic formulation, H1N1). This code may be reported in conjunction with the unique CPT code for H1N1 vaccine administration: 90470, H1N1 immunization administration (intramuscular, intranasal), including counseling when performed. Providers should follow instructions provided by the health plans with whom they contract related to billing for 2009 H1N1 vaccine administration.\n\nCMS has established two new HCPCS codes for 2009 H1N1 vaccine and vaccine administration: G9141- Influenza A (H1N1) immunization administration (includes the physician counseling the patient/family), and G9142- Influenza A (H1N1) vaccine, any route of administration.\n\nSpecial Populations\nWill screening of children for VFC eligibility be required prior to administration of 2009 H1N1 vaccine?\nNo.\n\nWill administration of 2009 H1N1 vaccine to eligible tribal members be covered by IHS?\nYes, the IHS will cover administration of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine to tribal members who are eligible for IHS health care benefits. There will be no charge to eligible tribal members for administration of 2009 H1N1 vaccine.\n\nCommercial Community Vaccinators (CCV)\nAre CCV who have not contracted with a public health department to provide staff or to run a public health vaccination clinic permitted to administer 2009 H1N1 vaccine?\nYes, a CCV can act as a private provider as long as the CCV has been designated as a 2009 H1N1 vaccinator by the jurisdiction in which it operates. If a CCV organizes a clinic outside of a contract with the public health department to provide staff or to run the vaccination clinic, the CCV may charge patients or bill insurance to recoup the costs of vaccine administration.\n\nWill 2009 H1N1 vaccination in a setting such as a pharmacy or a grocery store be covered by private health insurance plans?\nYes, health insurance plans providing coverage for influenza vaccinations will reimburse the administration of 2009 H1N1 vaccine provided in a setting if the vaccinator/site has an established contract with that insurer. In addition, many CCVs, including urgent care centers, retail-based clinics, and mass vaccinators, already have contracts in place with health insurance plans that can be used for reimbursement purposes. Appropriately licensed and credentialed CCV and pharmacies who seek reimbursement from health insurance plans should work with national, regional, and local insurance plans in anticipation of 2009 H1N1 vaccination.\n\nUninsured\nWhere can persons who are uninsured or underinsured receive 2009 H1N1 vaccine?\nIn addition to public health departments and the mass vaccination clinics they sponsor, Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), also known as Section 330-funded Health Centers (HCs), receive federal funding to provide healthcare to underserved populations, regardless of ability to pay, It is expected that the costs associated with administering 2009 H1N1 vaccine to existing health center patients would be borne by the health centers as part of the general expectations of their grants. As with all services they provide, Health Centers may charge a small fee.  However, public health departments are encouraged to provide funding to FQHCs and other types of HCs to cover the costs of vaccinating uninsured persons who are not health center patients, but who seek 2009 H1N1 vaccination at these clinics as an alternative to other vaccination providers. For health centers in your area, visit \"Find a Health Center\"External Web Site Icon. Additionally, providers may elect to provide the vaccine to uninsured or underinsured persons without charging an administration fee.\n\nWho will pay for the administration of 2009 H1N1 vaccine of uninsured or underinsured persons?\nFederal funds are being provided to public health authorities to ensure that uninsured or underinsured persons can receive H1N1 vaccine free of charge (see above).  Patients without insurance coverage for 2009 H1N1 vaccine may be vaccinated in a private provider\u2019s office if they are willing to pay the vaccine administration fee out of pocket, or if the provider chooses to administer the vaccine without charge.  Patients who cannot afford to pay a vaccine administration fee are encouraged to seek vaccination through their public health department, mass vaccination clinic, or through a CCV. \n\nWill private providers be able to charge patients for vaccine administration if they are uninsured?\nYes, private providers may charge a fee for the administration of the vaccine to the patient. Should they choose to charge an administration fee, the fee may not exceed the regional Medicare payment rate for seasonal influenza vaccine administration.  If the patient is unable to pay, the provider may choose to administer the 2009 H1N1 vaccine for free or for a reduced fee. Providers are encouraged to ensure that cost is not a barrier to vaccination.",

            "Text": "CDC\u2019s Influenza Division laboratories in Atlanta were the first in the world to identify the new 2009 H1N1 virus strain CDC\u2019s testing revealed that 2009 H1N1 was a new (novel) influenza virus strain that had not been previously detected in humans or animals\nThe new 2009 H1N1 virus was originally referred to as \u201cswine flu\u201d because initial laboratory tests at CDC showed that six of the virus\u2019s eight genes were most closely related to influenza viruses that normally occur in pigs in North America, and the remaining two genes were most closely related to influenza viruses circulating in Eurasian pigs CDC uploaded the complete gene sequences of the 2009 H1N1 Virus to a publicly-accessible international influenza database, which enabled scientists around the world to use the sequences for public health research and for comparison against influenza viruses collected elsewhere\nCDC\u2019s subject matter experts worked around the clock to create guidance documents for the general public, business, schools, child care programs, at-risk populations, clinicians, travelers, laboratory specialists, etc Many of these documents were revised several times as the outbreak developed and as new information became available\nOnce the 2009 H1N1 outbreak was detected, CDC enhanced its existing surveillance systems and added several new surveillance systems to better track the spread, disease characteristics and burden of the new virus\nOne of the new surveillance systems was the Aggregate Hospitalizations and Deaths Reporting Activity (AHDRA), which was a Web-based system used to track state reports of laboratory-confirmed and syndromic flu-related hospitalizations and deaths Because experts acknowledged that individual reports of hospitalizations and deaths likely represented an undercount of what was occurring in actuality, CDC also developed a method to estimate 2009 H1N1 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the United States. The methodology to derive these estimates was based in part on extrapolation from AHDRA data\nCDC laboratory experts quickly developed primers and probes that could be incorporated into previously manufactured tests to identify the 2009 H1N1 Virus in respiratory (nose, throat and lung) samples collected from patients with 2009 H1N1 illness Expedited FDA approval of an emergency use authorization (EUA) for these 2009 H1N1 diagnostic tests occurred on April 28, 2009, less than two weeks after identification of the 2009 H1N1 strain\nOn May 1, 2009, CDC test kits began shipping to domestic and international public health laboratories. As of August 2010, 2,344 RT-PCR test kits have been shipped to 442 labs in 145 countries and 305 WHO HI test kits have been shipped to 207 labs in 99 countries In response to Secretary of Heath and Human Services (HHS) Kathleen Sebelius\u2019 declaration of a public health emergency involving 2009 H1N1 flu on April 26, 2009, the FDA authorized the emergency use of important medical products under certain circumstances\nFDA issued EUAs on the five medical products CDC requested, which allowed for the emergency use of antiviral products (Relenza and Tamiflu), certain types/models of N95 respirators, the rRT-PCR Swine Flu Panel diagnostic test, and the rRT-PCR Flu Panel (NPS, NS, TS, NPS/TS, NA) diagnostic test\nOne of the most important laboratory activities performed at CDC was the selection and development of a candidate vaccine virus for use in the 2009 H1N1 vaccine\nCDC\u2019s laboratories took the first step of picking a candidate vaccine virus, which involves choosing a 2009 H1N1 virus that can be grown in mass quantities in chicken eggs Once the virus is grown in mass quantities, the parts of the virus that are important for forming an immune response to the vaccine (the virus antigens), are purified to make the vaccine\nCDC pursued several scientific methods to create a high-yield vaccine candidate virus for the 2009 H1N1 vaccine, and after consultation with WHO and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the A/California/7/2009 virus \u2013 a virus isolated at CDC \u2013 was chosen to be the vaccine candidate strain for making the 2009 H1N1 vaccine\nAfter the virus was ready on April 27, 2009, CDC began sending it to vaccine manufacturing companies to begin the process of mass producing a vaccine to protect people against 2009 H1N1 The 2009 H1N1 vaccine was made using the same egg-based manufacturing process used for making the seasonal flu vaccine. These techniques have been used to reliably produce safe flu vaccines for decades\nThe vaccine strain grew slowly in chicken eggs, resulting in delays in availability of initial lots of the vaccine. This led to some frustration on the part of the public during the early part of the fall wave of the pandemic, when vaccine supplies were limited\nDespite the delays, the 2009 H1N1 vaccine was made available in near-record time, considering current technological limitations",

            "Text": "Why does CDC advise pregnant women to receive the 2009 H1N1 influenza (flu) vaccine (shot)?\nGetting the flu shot is the single best way to protect against the flu. It is important for a pregnant woman to receive both the 2009 H1N1 flu shot and the seasonal flu shot. A pregnant woman who gets any type of flu has a greater chance for serious health problems. Compared with people in general who get 2009 H1N1 flu (formerly called \u201cswine flu\u201d), pregnant women with 2009 H1N1 flu are more likely to be admitted to hospitals. Pregnant women are also more likely to have serious illness and death from 2009 H1N1 flu. When a pregnant woman gets a flu shot, it can protect both her and her baby. Research has found that pregnant women who had a flu shot get sick less often with the flu than do pregnant women who did not get a flu shot. Babies born to mothers who had a flu shot in pregnancy also get sick with flu less often than do babies whose mothers did not get a flu shot.\n\nWill the seasonal flu shot also protect against the 2009 H1N1 flu?\nSeasonal flu and 2009 H1N1 flu are caused by different viruses. The seasonal flu vaccine will not protect against the 2009 H1N1 flu. Also, the 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine will not protect against seasonal flu.\n\nAre there flu vaccines that pregnant women should not get?\nThe seasonal and 2009 H1N1 flu vaccines can be given by shot or by nasal spray. Pregnant women should get the \"flu shot\"\u2014a vaccine made with killed flu virus. This one is given with a needle, usually in the arm. The other type of flu vaccine\u2014a nasal spray\u2014is not approved for pregnant women. This vaccine is made with live, weakened flu virus. Nasal spray flu vaccine should be used only in healthy people 2-49 years of age who are not pregnant. The nasal spray vaccine is safe for women after they have delivered, even if they are nursing.\n\nCan the seasonal flu shot and the 2009 H1N1 flu shot be given at the same time?\nSeasonal and 2009 H1N1 flu shots can be given on the same day but should be given at different sites (e.g., one shot in the left arm and the other shot in the right arm). If a woman is getting her vaccines after delivery, she can get the nasal spray flu vaccine. However, she should not get the seasonal and 2009 H1N1 nasal spays on the same day; they should be given 4 weeks apart.\n\ntop of page\n\nIs the 2009 H1N1 flu shot safe for pregnant women?\nThe seasonal flu shot has been given to millions of pregnant women over many years. Flu shots have not been shown to cause harm to pregnant women or their babies. The 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine is being made in the same way and at the same places where the seasonal flu vaccine is made.\n\nWhat studies have been done on the 2009 H1N1 flu shots and have any been done in pregnant women?\nStudies to test the 2009 H1N1 flu shots in healthy children and adults and pregnant women are being done now. Results are available from some of the studies done in non-pregnant adults and children. These results show that the immune system responded well to the 2009 H1N1 vaccine, and the safety results were very similar to those seen in studies of seasonal flu vaccine. These studies are being conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the vaccine manufacturers. Read more about these studiesExternal Web Site Icon.\n\nDoes the 2009 H1N1 flu shot have mercury in it?\nThere is no evidence that thimerosal (a mercury preservative in vaccine that comes in multi-dose vials) is harmful to a pregnant woman or a fetus. However, because some women are concerned about thimerosal during pregnancy, vaccine companies are making preservative-free seasonal flu vaccine and 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine in single-dose syringes for pregnant women and small children. CDC advises pregnant women to get flu shots either with or without thimerosal.\n\nDoes the 2009 H1N1 flu shot have an adjuvant or squalene in it?\nAdjuvants are agents that are sometimes added to a vaccine to make it more effective. There are no adjuvants (such as squalene) in either the 2009 H1N1 or seasonal flu shot used in the United States.\n\ntop of page\n\nCan the 2009 H1N1 flu shot be given at any time during pregnancy?\nBoth seasonal flu shots and 2009 H1N1 flu shots are recommended for pregnant women at any time during pregnancy.\n\nHow many 2009 H1N1 flu shots will a pregnant woman need to get?\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of one shot for full protection for persons 10 years and older. Therefore, a pregnant woman is recommended to get one dose of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine.\n\nShould the 2009 H1N1 flu shot be given to a pregnant woman who had flu between April 2009 and now? Do I need a test to know if I need the shot or not?\nA pregnant woman who had a flu-like illness at any time in the past should still get the 2009 H1N1 shot because she cannot assume that the illness she had was caused by the 2009 H1N1 virus. Pregnant women who had flu symptoms in the past do not need to be tested now, but should get the vaccine.\n\nWhat are the possible side effects of the 2009 H1N1 flu shots?\nThe side effects from 2009 H1N1 flu shots are expected to be like those from seasonal flu shots. The most common side effects after flu shots are mild, such as being sore and tender and/or red and swollen where the shot was given. Some people might have headache, muscle aches, fever, and nausea or feel tired. If these problems happen, they usually begin soon after the shot and may last as long as 1-2 days. Some people may faint after getting any shot. Sometimes, flu shots can cause serious problems like severe allergic reactions. But, life-threatening allergic reactions to vaccines are very rare. A person who has a severe (life-threatening) allergy to eggs or to anything else in the vaccine should not get the shot, even if she is pregnant. Pregnant women should tell the person giving the shots if they have any severe allergies or if they have ever had a severe allergic reaction following a flu shot.\n\ntop of page\n\nIs the 2009 H1N1 flu shot expected to be associated with Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS)?\nIn 1976, an earlier type of swine flu vaccine was associated with cases of a severe paralytic illness called Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) at a rate of approximately 1 case of GBS per 100,000 persons vaccinated. Some studies done since 1976 have shown a small risk of GBS in persons who received the seasonal influenza vaccine. This risk is estimated to be no more than 1 case of GBS per 1 million persons vaccinated. Other studies have shown no increase in risk of GBS. Pregnant women should tell the person giving the shots if they have ever had GBS.\n\nCan family members or other close contacts of a pregnant woman receive the nasal spray vaccine?\nPregnant women should not receive nasal spray for the seasonal or 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine, but it is okay for a pregnant woman to be around a family member or another close contact who has received nasal spray flu vaccine. The nasal spray vaccine can be used in healthy people 2-49 years of age who are not pregnant and in women after they deliver, even if they are nursing.\n\nCan a pregnant healthcare provider give the live nasal spray flu vaccine?\nYes. No special precautions are needed. Nurses and doctors should wash their hands or use an alcohol-based hand rub before and after giving the vaccine.\n\nWhat if a pregnant woman gets the live nasal spray flu vaccine instead of the flu shot?\nThe nasal spray flu vaccine has not been approved for pregnant women. It differs from the flu shot because it is made with live, weakened virus. However, sometimes a pregnant woman might get the nasal spray flu vaccine\u2014for example, before she knew she was pregnant. If this happened, she would not be expected to have any additional problems. The weakened, live flu virus has never been shown to be passed to the unborn baby. However, if a woman does get the nasal spray vaccine while she is pregnant, she should talk to her healthcare provider.\n\nIf a pregnant woman delivers her baby before receiving her seasonal flu shot or her 2009 H1N1 flu shot, should she still receive them?\nYes. Besides protecting her from infection, the shot may also help protect her infant. Flu shots are only given to infants 6 months of age and older. Everyone who lives with or gives care to an infant less than 6 months of age should get both the seasonal flu and 2009 H1N1 vaccines. A woman can get either the shots or the nasal spray after she delivers.\n\ntop of page\n\nCan a breastfeeding mother receive the flu shot or the nasal spray?\nYes. Both seasonal and 2009 H1N1 flu vaccines should be given to breastfeeding mothers and breastfeeding women can receive either the shot or the nasal spray form of the vaccine. Breastfeeding is fully compatible with flu vaccination, and preventing the flu in mothers can reduce the chance that the infant will get the flu. Also, by breastfeeding, mothers can pass on to the infant the antibodies that their bodies make in response to the flu shots, which can reduce the infant\u2019s chances of getting sick with the flu. This is especially important for infants less than 6 months old, who have no other way of receiving vaccine antibodies, since they are too young to be vaccinated.\n\nWhat is the recommended interval between the first and second dose of 2009 H1N1 vaccine for children younger than 10 years of age?\nFor children younger than 10 years of age, CDC recommends that the two doses of 2009 H1N1 vaccine be separated by 4 weeks. However, if the second dose is separated from the first dose by at least 21 days, the second dose can be considered valid.",

            "Text": "The world is no longer in phase 6 of influenza pandemic alert. We are now moving into the post-pandemic period. The new H1N1 virus has largely run its course.\n\nThese are the views of members of the Emergency Committee, which was convened earlier today by teleconference.\n\nThe Committee based its assessment on the global situation, as well as reports from several countries that are now experiencing influenza. I fully agree with the Committee\u2019s advice.\n\nAs we enter the post-pandemic period, this does not mean that the H1N1 virus has gone away. Based on experience with past pandemics, we expect the H1N1 virus to take on the behaviour of a seasonal influenza virus and continue to circulate for some years to come.\n\nIn the post-pandemic period, localized outbreaks of different magnitude may show significant levels of H1N1 transmission. This is the situation we are observing right now in New Zealand, and may see elsewhere.\n\nIn fact, the actions of health authorities in New Zealand, and also in India, in terms of vigilance, quick detection and treatment, and recommended vaccination, provide a model of how other countries may need to respond in the immediate post-pandemic period.\n\nGlobally, the levels and patterns of H1N1 transmission now being seen differ significantly from what was observed during the pandemic. Out-of-season outbreaks are no longer being reported in either the northern or southern hemisphere. Influenza outbreaks, including those primarily caused by the H1N1 virus, show an intensity similar to that seen during seasonal epidemics.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the H1N1 virus crowded out other influenza viruses to become the dominant virus. This is no longer the case. Many countries are reporting a mix of influenza viruses, again as is typically seen during seasonal epidemics.\n\nRecently published studies indicate that 20\u201340% of populations in some areas have been infected by the H1N1 virus and thus have some level of protective immunity. Many countries report good vaccination coverage, especially in high-risk groups, and this coverage further increases community-wide immunity.\n\nPandemics, like the viruses that cause them, are unpredictable. So is the immediate post-pandemic period. There will be many questions, and we will have clear answers for only some. Continued vigilance is extremely important, and WHO has issued advice on recommended surveillance, vaccination, and clinical management during the post-pandemic period.\n\nBased on available evidence and experience from past pandemics, it is likely that the virus will continue to cause serious disease in younger age groups, at least in the immediate post-pandemic period. Groups identified during the pandemic as at higher risk of severe or fatal illness will probably remain at heightened risk, though hopefully the number of such cases will diminish.\n\nIn addition, a small proportion of people infected during the pandemic, including young and healthy people, developed a severe form of primary viral pneumonia that is not typically seen during seasonal epidemics and is especially difficult and demanding to treat. It is not known whether this pattern will change during the post-pandemic period, further emphasizing the need for vigilance.\n\nAs I said, pandemics are unpredictable and prone to deliver surprises. No two pandemics are ever alike. This pandemic has turned out to be much more fortunate than what we feared a little over a year ago.\n\nThis time around, we have been aided by pure good luck. The virus did not mutate during the pandemic to a more lethal form. Widespread resistance to oseltamivir did not develop. The vaccine proved to be a good match with circulating viruses and showed an excellent safety profile.\n\nThanks to extensive preparedness and support from the international community, even countries with very weak health systems were able to detect cases and report them promptly.\n\nHad things gone wrong in any of these areas, we would be in a very different situation today.\n\nI will be happy to answer your questions.",

            "Text": "Weekly update\n6 AUGUST 2010 - As of 1 August 2010, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 18449 deaths.\n\nWHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.\n\nSituation update:\nThe overall situation remains largely unchanged since the last update. Globally, pandemic influenza transmission remains most active in parts of South Asia and in limited areas of tropical South and Central America. In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, overall seasonal and pandemic influenza activity remains low, except in South Africa, where peak wintertime influenza transmission due to circulating seasonal influenza viruses (H3N2 and type B) might have recently occurred. Seasonal influenza viruses, particularly H3N2 viruses, continue to circulate in parts of Central America, East Africa, and Southeast Asia.\n\nDuring the 2010 winter of the temperate southern hemisphere, the most active areas of influenza virus transmission have been in South Africa, where the majority of influenza virus detections have been seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B viruses; pandemic influenza virus has been detected there only sporadically. Elsewhere in Argentina, Chile, New Zealand, and Australia, overall influenza activity remains low and below levels observed during recent, mild, pre-pandemic influenza seasons; among the latter three countries, pandemic influenza viruses have been detected most frequently, however, low level co-circulation of seasonal influenza H3N2 and type B has also been observed. In South Africa, the current wintertime epidemic of seasonal influenza appears to have peaked during early July 2010 and stabilized since then; to date, influenza type B viruses have accounted for a greater proportion of influenza viruses detected among severe (SARI) cases than have influenza H3N2 viruses. Chile and Argentina continue to observe low levels of respiratory diseases in the population, and much of what has been observed in recent months has been due to circulation of respiratory viruses other than influenza, particularly RSV. In Australia and New Zealand there has been a sustained upward trend in the rates of ILI over the past 6-8 weeks, particularly in recent weeks, however, overall rates remain well below those observed during the same period in 2009 during the first pandemic wave in the southern hemisphere. Data on the clinical and epidemiological pattern of pandemic influenza virus infection during the current winter season have been limited due to the fact that there has been limited virus transmission to date; however, preliminary data suggests that the pattern has not changed compared to what was seen last winter during the first pandemic wave in the southern hemisphere.\n\nIn Asia, the most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of India, and to a much lesser extent, in parts of Nepal and Bhutan. Transmission appears to have peaked in the southern state of Kerala, while transmission remains moderately intense in the western state of Maharashtra, and may be increasing in several eastern states, including Orissa and West Bengal. Limited, preliminary data suggests that the overall intensity and severity of the current regional epidemics in India do not yet appear to exceed what was observed during the first wave in 2009, however, it is too early make a complete assessment of the situation as the regional epidemics are still evolving. Similarly, there has been no evidence to date to suggest that clinical and epidemiological pattern of pandemic influenza virus infection has changed during the current period of active transmission. Overall, across India, approximately \u00bc of respiratory samples tested positive for influenza as of third week of July 2010; however, in at least one region of India, up to 1/3 of respiratory samples tested positive for influenza. In addition to the recent increases in circulation of pandemic influenza viruses in India, there has been, in recent months, active circulation of seasonal influenza type B viruses, and to a lesser extent, seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses. In neighboring Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal, but not Sri Lanka, there is limited evidence of low levels of pandemic influenza virus transmission, including reports of localized outbreaks in Nepal and Bhutan. In Southeast Asia, low to sporadic levels of co-circulating pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses have been detected across the region over the past month.\n\nIn the tropical regions of the Americas, active subregional co-circulation of seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses continued to be detected during July 2010. Since early June 2010, predominantly seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have circulated in Panama, Nicaragua, and Honduras; seasonal influenza B and more recently H3N2 viruses in El Salvador; and, predominantly pandemic influenza and H3N2 viruses in Costa Rica and Columbia.\n\nIn sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa), Ghana continued to report sustained transmission of pandemic influenza virus during June and July 2010; during the most recent reporting week, 27% of respiratory samples tested positive for pandemic influenza virus. Limited data indicate that seasonal influenza H3N2 and B viruses continued to circulate at variable levels in parts of eastern Africa and central Africa, respectively. In Cameroon, a sustained period of active transmission of seasonal influenza B viruses, which began during early June 2010, now appears to be subsiding. In Kenya, there has been persistent low level circulation of seasonal H3N2 viruses since late April 2010.\n\nIn the temperate regions of the Northern hemisphere, pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses have been detected only sporadically or at very low levels during the past month.",

            "HeadLine": "What is the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus?",
            "Text": "This is an influenza virus that had never been identified as a cause of infections in people before the current H1N1 pandemic. Genetic analyses of this virus have shown that it originated from animal influenza viruses and is unrelated to the human seasonal H1N1 viruses that have been in general circulation among people since 1977.\n\nAntigenic analysis has shown that antibodies to the seasonal H1N1 virus do not protect against the pandemic H1N1 virus. However, other studies have shown that a significant percentage of people age 65 and older do have some immunity against the pandemic virus. This suggests that some people in the older age group may have some cross protection from exposure to viruses that have circulated in the more distant past.\n\nAfter early outbreaks in North America in April 2009 the new influenza virus spread rapidly around the world. By the time WHO declared a pandemic in June 2009, a total of 74 countries and territories had reported laboratory confirmed infections. To date, most countries in the world have confirmed infections from the new virus.\n\nUnlike typical seasonal flu patterns, the new virus caused high levels of summer infections in the northern hemisphere, and then even higher levels of activity during cooler months in this part of the world.\n\nThe new virus has also led to patterns of death and illness not normally seen in influenza infections. Most of the deaths caused by the pandemic influenza have occurred among younger people, including those who were otherwise healthy. Pregnant women, younger children and people of any age with certain chronic lung or other medical conditions appear to be at higher risk of more complicated or severe illness. Many of the severe cases have been due to viral pneumonia, which is harder to treat than bacterial pneumonias usually associated with seasonal influenza. Many of these patients have required intensive care.\n\nWho is at higher risk for severe illness?\nHow do people become infected with the virus?\nThe pandemic H1N1 virus is spread from person to person, similar to seasonal influenza viruses. It is transmitted as easily as the normal seasonal flu and can be passed to other people by exposure to infected droplets expelled by coughing or sneezing that can be inhaled, or that can contaminate hands or surfaces.\n\nTo prevent spread, people who are ill should cover their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, stay home when they are unwell, clean their hands regularly, and keep some distance from healthy people, as much as possible.\n\nWhat can I do?\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of typical infection?\nSigns of the pandemic influenza are flu-like, including malaise, fever, cough, headache, muscle and joint pain, sore throat and runny nose, and sometimes vomiting and diarrhoea.\n\nThe majority of people with pandemic influenza experience mild illness and recover fully without treatment.\n\nWhen should someone seek medical care?\nPeople should seek medical care if they experience shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, or if a fever, and especially high fever, continues more than three days. For parents with a young child who is ill, seek medical care if a child has fast or labored breathing, continuing fever or convulsions (seizures).\n\nSupportive care at home - resting, drinking plenty of fluids and using a pain reliever for aches and pains - is adequate for recovery in most cases. A non-aspirin pain reliever should be used for children or adolescents under age 18.\n\nWhy was WHO so worried about this flu when hundreds of thousands die every year from seasonal epidemics?\nSeasonal influenza occurs every year and the viruses change each year - but many people have some immunity to the circulating virus that helps limit infections. Some countries also use seasonal influenza vaccines to reduce illness and deaths.\n\nBy contrast, the pandemic H1N1 was a new virus when it emerged and most people had no or little immunity to it. In addition, one of the lessons from history is that influenza pandemics can kill millions. Finally, there was no pandemic influenza vaccine at the outset.\n\nThe global impact of the current pandemic has not yet been estimated. Typically, the numbers of deaths from seasonal influenza or past pandemics are estimated using statistical models.\n\nBy contrast, the currently reported counts of over 16,000 deaths from pandemic H1N1 represent individually tested and confirmed deaths, primarily reported from countries with adequate resources for widespread laboratory testing. This approach has never been used to count seasonal or previous pandemic deaths and results in a significant underestimate.\n\nA more accurate assessment of mortality from the pandemic, using statistical models, will likely be possible in about one to two years.",

Recent studies in the United Kingdom indicate that about one-third of school children in the country have been infected with the virus so far.\n\nWhat about risk of death?\nThe majority of people with pandemic influenza experience mild illness and the overall risk of dying from this infection is low.\n\nTo date, the number of laboratory-confirmed deaths from the pandemic flu is over 16,000 cases but the real death toll is believed to be much higher.\n\nIt will only be possible to accurately estimate the total number of deaths, and death rates among certain groups, one to two years after the pandemic has peaked.

            "HeadLine": "First Global Estimates of 2009 H1N1 Pandemic Mortality Released by CDC-Led Collaboration",
            "Text": "June 25, 2012 \u2014 A study published today in The Lancet Infectious Diseases Online Firstexternal icon provides the first global estimates of how many people died as a result of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. The study, co-authored by 9 members of the CDC Influenza Division, used an improved modeling approach which resulted in an estimated range of deaths from between 151,700 and 575,400 people who perished worldwide from 2009 H1N1 virus infection during the first year the virus circulated. A disproportionate number of deaths occurred in Southeast Asia and Africa, where access to prevention and treatment resources are more likely to be limited. Study authors hope that this work can be used not only to improve how influenza deaths are estimated, but also to improve the public health response during future pandemics in parts of the world that suffer more influenza-related deaths.\nThese global estimates are more than 15 times higher than the number of laboratory-confirmed deaths reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). WHO has acknowledged for some time that official, lab-confirmed reports are an underestimate of actual number of influenza deaths. Diagnostic specimens are not always collected from people who die with influenza; for others, influenza virus may not be detectable by the time of death. Because of these challenges, modeling is used to estimate the actual burden of disease.\n\nInfluenza Disease Mortality Burden\nWhile studies looking at the burden of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic by country have been published previously, this is the first study to assess the global mortality impact of the pandemic. The authors of the study had to overcome numerous challenges to arrive at these estimates, including lack of data specific to influenza in many countries, variability in terms of the level and timing of influenza virus circulation and differences across countries based on socio-economic factors listed above. They did this by using influenza surveillance data from high-, middle- and low-income countries, case fatality ratios reported from high income countries and the World Health Organization Burden of Disease data on lower respiratory tract infection mortality.\n\nThe estimated number of deaths from this model was similar to previous mortality estimates during the first 12 months of 2009 H1N1 virus circulation in some countries, including the United States.\n\nAccording to the study, the largest death burden may have occurred in countries in the African and Southeast Asian regions, where it was estimated that more than half of all 2009 H1N1-related deaths occurred. These regions are home to 38 percent of the world\u2019s population. People living in these countries may be at higher risk for death from influenza complications due to differences in access to and quality of health care, nutritional status, the prevalence of underlying conditions, the age structure of the population and limited availability of influenza vaccines and antiviral medications.\n\n\u201cThe lack of mortality estimates in low- and middle-income countries represents an important knowledge gap in understanding the impact of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic on the world\u2019s population,\u201d says study author Dr. Fatimah Dawood of CDC.\n\n2009 H1N1 Pandemic Hits the Young Especially Hard\n\u201cOngoing efforts to strengthen influenza surveillance worldwide, particularly for influenza-associated mortality, are needed both to guide seasonal influenza prevention strategies and to build influenza surveillance systems to provide better, more timely, and globally representative data for influenza-associated mortality during future pandemics,\u201d says Dawood.\n\nThis study estimated that 80% of 2009 H1N1 deaths were in people younger than 65 years of age which differs from typical seasonal influenza epidemics during which 80-90% of deaths are estimated to occur in people 65 years of age and older. To illustrate the impact of the shift in the age distribution of influenza deaths to younger age groups during the pandemic, researchers calculated the number of years of life lost due to 2009 H1N1-associated deaths. They estimated that 3 times as many years of life were lost during the first year of 2009 H1N1 virus circulation than would have occurred for the same number of deaths during a typical influenza season.\n\n\u201cPrevious studies have documented that people younger than 65 years were more affected by the 2009 H1N1 pandemic than during typical influenza seasons. Our estimates support this observation and our analysis of years of life lost during the first year of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic underscores the impact that this pandemic had in comparison to typical seasonal influenza epidemics,\u201d says Dawood.\n\nThough the most recent influenza pandemic was hard on the young, the impact on the global population overall during the first year was less severe than that of previous pandemics. Estimates of pandemic influenza mortality ranged from 0.03% of the world\u2019s population during the 1968 pandemic to 1\u20133% of the world\u2019s population during the 1918 pandemic. It was estimated that 0.001\u20130.007% of the world\u2019s population died of respiratory complications associated with 2009 H1N1 virus infection during the first 12 months the virus circulated (or 0.001\u20130.011% when cardiovascular deaths were included).\n\nBecause respiratory or cardiovascular influenza-related complications can lead to death, researchers estimated both respiratory and cardiovascular deaths to reach a total global estimate of mortality. An estimated 105,700-395,600 respiratory deaths occurred, while an additional 46,000-179,900 deaths were attributed to cardiovascular complications. (Influenza-associated cardiovascular deaths were only estimated in persons 18 years of age and older since cardiovascular complications are relatively rare in children younger than 18 years.)\n\nThis study\u2019s approach to measuring the impact of 2009 H1N1 shows progress toward more accurate estimates of global mortality and advances understanding of the burden of influenza around the world, while the volume of estimated 2009 H1N1 deaths underscores the need for CDC\u2019s continued commitment to influenza prevention and control activities around the world.\n\n\u201cOngoing efforts to strengthen influenza surveillance worldwide, particularly for influenza-associated mortality, are needed both to guide seasonal influenza prevention strategies and to build influenza surveillance systems to provide better, more timely, and globally representative data for influenza-associated mortality during future pandemics,\u201d says Dawood.",

SARS-CoV is thought to be an animal virus from an as-yet-uncertain animal reservoir, perhaps bats, that spread to other animals (civet cats) and first infected humans in the Guangdong province of southern China in 2002.\n\nTransmission\nAn epidemic of SARS affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8000 cases in 2003. Since then, a small number of cases have occurred as a result of laboratory accidents or, possibly, through animal-to-human transmission (Guangdong, China).\n\nTransmission of SARS-CoV is primarily from person to person. It appears to have occurred mainly during the second week of illness, which corresponds to the peak of virus excretion in respiratory secretions and stool, and when cases with severe disease start to deteriorate clinically. Most cases of human-to-human transmission occurred in the health care setting, in the absence of adequate infection control precautions. Implementation of appropriate infection control practices brought the global outbreak to an end.\n\nNature of the disease\nSymptoms are influenza-like and include fever, malaise, myalgia, headache, diarrhoea, and shivering (rigors). No individual symptom or cluster of symptoms has proved to be specific for a diagnosis of SARS. Although fever is the most frequently reported symptom, it is sometimes absent on initial measurement, especially in elderly and immunosuppressed patients.\n\nCough (initially dry), shortness of breath, and diarrhoea are present in the first and/or second week of illness. Severe cases often evolve rapidly, progressing to respiratory distress and requiring intensive care.\n\nGeographical distribution\nThe distribution is based on the 2002\u20132003 epidemic. The disease appeared in November 2002 in the Guangdong province of southern China. This area is considered as a potential zone of re-emergence of SARS-CoV.\n\nOther countries/areas in which chains of human-to-human transmission occurred after early importation of cases were Toronto in Canada, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, Chinese Taipei, Singapore, and Hanoi in Viet Nam.\n\nRisk for travellers\nCurrently, no areas of the world are reporting transmission of SARS. Since the end of the global epidemic in July 2003, SARS has reappeared four times \u2013 three times from laboratory accidents (Singapore and Chinese Taipei), and once in southern China where the source of infection remains undetermined although there is circumstantial evidence of animal-to-human transmission.\n\nShould SARS re-emerge in epidemic form, WHO will provide guidance on the risk of travel to affected areas. Travellers should stay informed about current travel recommendations. However, even during the height of the 2003 epidemic, the overall risk of SARS-CoV transmission to travellers was low.",

            "HeadLine": "SARS outbreak contained worldwide",
            "Text": "Threat remains and more research needed, says WHO\nGENEVA, 5 JULY 2003 - Today, the World Health Organization is removing Taiwan, China, from the list of areas with recent local transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Taiwan is the last area to be removed from the list. It has been 20 days, or two consecutive 10-day incubation periods, since the last case on June 15. Based on country surveillance reports, the human chains of SARS virus transmission appear to have been broken everywhere in the world.\n\nHowever, due to the many questions remaining about SARS and the possibility that cases may have slipped through the surveillance net, WHO warns that continued global vigilance for SARS is crucial for the foreseeable future. The world is not yet SARS-free.\n\n\u201cWe do not mark the end of SARS today, but we observe a milestone: the global SARS outbreak has been contained,\u201d said Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, Director-General of the World Health Organization. \u201cAt this moment, we should all pause and give thanks to scientists, public health and hospital workers who took risks in the face of a new and unknown disease. And, we must remember those frontline workers who died of SARS. Their daily dedication, courage and vigilance averted a global catastrophe.\u201d\n\nFrom the Guangdong province in China, the SARS virus travelled in humans to 30 countries and areas of the world but it became deeply embedded in just six. In these areas, the pattern of transmission was the same: An imported hospitalized SARS case infected health care workers and other patients; they infected their close contacts and then the disease moved into the larger community. In affected areas approximately 20% of all cases were in health care workers. To date, 8439 people have been affected, and 812 have died from SARS. Now, five months after SARS began its spread around the world, it is close to being driven out of humans.\n\nSARS continues to threaten the world. Close to 200 people remain hospitalized with the disease. And, it is possible that undetected cases may have slipped through the surveillance network. Thus, while today we have no reports of local transmission, that may not be the case tomorrow.\n\n\u201cThis is not the time to relax our vigilance. The world must remain on high alert for cases of SARS.\u201d said Brundtland.\n\nSARS will continue to menace the global public health system. It is possible that new SARS cases will appear. SARS could be a seasonal disease and return later in the year - a possibility based on what we know about other members of the coronavirus family. Further, the original source of this SARS outbreak may still be in the environment and could ignite a new outbreak in the coming months. For example, it is possible the virus still circulates in an animal reservoir and may cross into humans again when conditions are right.\n\n\u201cTo answer these and other questions, research into SARS must continue. Scientific evidence will be crucial for our ability to best handle another SARS outbreak should there be one,\u201d said Dr Brundtland.\n\nThe public health research agenda for SARS is long and growing. At the top of the list is a early diagnostic test, which can detect the presence of the disease within days of disease onset. This will be needed to distinguish SARS patients from those suffering from other respiratory illnesses, especially when the flu season arrives. Without a diagnostic test, hospitals may be forced to isolate all persons with respiratory disease fitting the SARS case definition, and this will be enormously expensive and divert essential resources from other health needs. WHO is working with it's partners to develop case investigation, case management and surveillance protocols for SARS in the post outbreak environment. These will be living documents revised regularly as our knowledge expands.\n\nSecond, intense investigations into a possible animal reservoir are needed. Only by identifying the original source of this outbreak, and understanding the way the virus moves from the original source to humans, can future outbreaks be prevented. Third, a global database is required to give epidemiologists and clinicians the power of large numbers to better understand SARS. Also, we need a better understanding of the advantages of different therapeutic approaches in the treatment of SARS.\n\n\u201cSARS is a warning,\u201d said Dr Brundtland. \u201cSARS pushed even the most advanced public health systems to the breaking point. Those protections held, but just barely. Next time, we may not be so lucky. We have an opportunity now, and we see the need clearly, to rebuild our public health protections. They will be needed for the next global outbreak, if it is SARS or another new infection.\u201d\n\nPreparing for the next outbreak requires restoring and strengthening the public health infrastructure. More epidemiologists and other public health specialists are needed. Better surveillance and response systems must be established which include strong national, regional and global linkages in reporting. And governments need to invest more in hospital infection control.\n\n\u201cSARS is teaching us many lessons,\u201d said Dr Brundtland. \u201cNow we must translate those lessons into action. We may have very little time, and we must use it wisely.\u201d",

It was first identified at the end of February 2003 during an outbreak that emerged in China and spread to 4 other countries. WHO co-ordinated the international investigation with the assistance of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) and worked closely with health authorities in affected countries to provide epidemiological, clinical and logistical support and to bring the outbreak under control.\n\nSARS is an airborne virus and can spread through small droplets of saliva in a similar way to the cold and influenza. It was the first severe and readily transmissible new disease to emerge in the 21st century and showed a clear capacity to spread along the routes of international air travel.\n\nSARS can also be spread indirectly via surfaces that have been touched by someone who is infected with the virus.\n\nMost patients identified with SARS were previously healthy adults aged 25\u201370 years. A few suspected cases of SARS have been reported among children under 15 years. The case fatality among persons with illness meeting the current WHO case definition for probable and suspected cases of SARS is around 3%. The incubation period of SARS is usually 2-7 days but may be as long as 10 days.\n\nThe first symptom of the illness is generally fever (>38\u00b0C), which is often high, and sometimes associated with chills and rigors. It may also be accompanied by other symptoms including headache, malaise, and muscle pain. At the onset of illness, some cases have mild respiratory symptoms. Typically, rash and neurologic or gastrointestinal findings are absent, although a few patients have reported diarrhoea during the early febrile stage.\n\nAfter 3-7 days, a lower respiratory phase begins with the onset of a dry, non-productive cough or dyspnoea (shortness of breath) that may be accompanied by, or progress to, hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels). In 10\u201320% of cases, the respiratory illness is severe enough to require intubation and mechanical ventilation. Chest radiographs may be normal throughout the course of illness, though not for all patients. The white blood cell count is often decreased early in the disease, and many people have low platelet counts at the peak of the disease. There is no cure or vaccine for SARS and treatment should be supportive and based on the patient\u2019s symptoms.\n\nControlling outbreaks relies on containment measures including:\n\nprompt detection of cases through good surveillance networks and including an early warning system;\nisolation of suspected of probably cases;\ntracing to identify both the source of the infection and contacts of those who are sick and may be at risk of contracting the virus;\nquarantine of suspected contacts for 10 days;\nexit screening for outgoing passengers from areas with recent local transmission by asking questions and temperature measurement; and\ndisinfection of aircraft and cruise vessels having SARS cases on board using WHO guidelines.\nPersonal preventive measures to prevent spread of the virus include frequent hand washing using soap or alcohol-based disinfectants. For those with a high risk of contracting the disease, such as health care workers, use of personal protective equipment, including a mask, goggles and an apron is mandatory.  Whenever possible, household contacts should also wear a mask.",

The outbreak lasted approximately six months as the disease spread to more than two dozen countries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia before it was stopped in July 2003. See below a timeline of CDC\u2019s key activities conducted during the outbreak and beyond.\n\n2002\nNovember 16: The first case of atypical pneumonia is reported in the Guangdong province in southern China. 2003\nMarch 12: The World Health Organization (WHO) issues a global alert for a severe form of pneumonia of unknown origin in persons from China, Vietnam, and Hong Kong.\n\nMarch 14: CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center (EOC).\n\nMarch 15: CDC issues first health alert and hosts media telebriefing about an atypical pneumonia that has been named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). CDC issues interim guidelines for state and local health departments on SARS.\n\nCDC issues a \u201cHealth Alert Notice\u201d for travelers to the United States from Hong Kong, Guangdong Province (China).\n\nMarch 20: CDC issues infection control precautions for aerosol-generating procedures on patients who are suspected of having SARS.\n\nMarch 22: CDC issues interim laboratory biosafety guidelines for handling and processing specimens associated with SARS.\n\nMarch 24: CDC laboratory analysis suggests a new coronavirus may be the cause of SARS. In the United States, 39 suspect cases (to date) had been identified. Of those cases, 32 of 39 had traveled to countries were SARS was reported.\n\nMarch 27: CDC issues interim domestic guidelines for management of exposures to SARS for healthcare and other institutional settings.\n\nMarch 28: The SARs outbreak is more widespread. CDC begins utilizing pandemic planning for SARS.\n\nMarch 29: CDC extended its travel advisory for SARS to include all of mainland China and added Singapore. CDC quarantine staff began meeting planes, cargo ships and cruise ships coming either directly or indirectly to the United States from China, Singapore and Vietnam and also begins distributing health alert cards to travelers.\n\nApril 4: The number of suspected U.S. SARS cases was 115; reported from 29 states. There were no deaths among these suspect cases of SARS in the United States.\n\nApril 5: CDC establishes community outreach team to address stigmatization associated with SARS.\n\nApril 10: CDC issued specific guidance for students exposed to SARS.\n\nApril 14: CDC publishes a sequence of the virus believed to be responsible for the global epidemic of SARS. Identifying the genetic sequence of a new virus is important to treatment and prevention efforts. The results came just 12 days after a team of scientists and technicians began working around the clock to grow cells taken from the throat culture of a SARS patient.\n\nApril 22: CDC issues a health alert for travelers to Toronto, Ontario (Canada)\n\nMay 6: In the United States, no new probable cases were reported in the last 24 hours, and there was no evidence of ongoing transmission beyond the initial case reports in travelers for more than 20 days. The containment in the United States has been successful.\n\nMay 20: CDC lifted the travel alert on Toronto because more than 30 days (or three SARS incubation periods) had elapsed since the date of onset of symptoms for the last reported case.\n\nMay 23: CDC reinstated travel alert for Toronto because on May 22, Canadian health officials reported a cluster of five new probable SARS cases.\n\nJune 4: CDC removed the travel alert for Singapore and downgraded the traveler notification for Hong Kong from a travel advisory to a travel alert.\n\nJuly 3: CDC removed the travel alert for mainland China.\n\nJuly 5: WHO announced that the global SARS outbreak was contained.\n\nJuly 10: CDC removed the travel alert for Hong Kong and Toronto.\n\nJuly 15: CDC removed the travel alert for Taiwan.\n\nJuly 17: CDC updated the SARS case definition which reduced the number of U.S. cases by half. The change results from excluding cases in which blood specimens that were collected more than 21 days after the onset of illness test negative.\n\nDecember 31: Globally, WHO received reports of SARS from 29 countries and regions; 8,096 persons with probable SARS resulting in 774 deaths. In the United States, eight SARS infections were documented by laboratory testing and an additional 19 probable SARS infections were reported.\n\n Top of Page\n2004\nJanuary 13: CDC issues \u201cNotice of Embargo of Civets.\u201d A SARS-like virus had been isolated from civets (captured in areas of China where the SARS outbreak originated). CDC banned the importation of civets. The civet is a mammal with a catlike body, long legs, a long tail, and a masked face resembling a raccoon or weasel. The ban is currently still in effect.\n\n Top of Page\n2012\nOctober 5: The National Select Agent Registry Program declared SARS-coronavirus a select agent.

            "HeadLine": "Questions & Answers: 2009 H1N1 Nasal Spray Vaccine",
            "Text": "Influenza A (H1N1) Monovalent Nasal-Spray Flu Vaccine (Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine [LAIV]\nWhat is the nasal spray flu vaccine?\nWhat is the nasal spray flu vaccine? There are two types of flu vaccine: the flu shot and the nasal spray vaccine. Both types of vaccine are being made against 2009 H1N1. The nasal spray flu vaccine (sometimes called LAIV for Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine) is a vaccine made with live, weakened viruses that cannot grow at normal body temperature and is given via a nasal sprayer. This vaccine was approved for seasonal influenza viruses in 2003 and tens of millions of doses of the vaccine have been given in the United States.\n\nHow is the 2009 H1N1 nasal spray vaccine different from the seasonal nasal spray vaccine?\nThe 2009 H1N1 nasal spray vaccine is being made in the same way as the seasonal nasal spray vaccine, but instead of containing three weakened live flu viruses, it only contains weakened 2009 H1N1 virus. (That is why it\u2019 is called a \u201cmonovalent\u201d vaccine.). The recommendations for who can get the 2009 H1N1 nasal spray vaccine are the same as for seasonal nasal spray vaccine. LAIV is recommended for use in healthy* people 2 years to 49 years of age who are not pregnant.\n\nWho can be vaccinated with the 2009 H1N1 nasal-spray flu vaccine (LAIV)?\nThe 2009 H1N1 nasal spray vaccine is recommended for use in healthy people 2 years Through 49 years of age who are not pregnant. See below\n\nCan health care providers get the live attenuated influenza vaccine?\nYes Adobe PDF file. LAIV is a very good option for most health care providers who are healthy, younger than 50 years old, and not pregnant. However, health care providers should not get LAIV if they are providing medical care for patients who require special environments in the hospital because they are profoundly immunocompromised (e.g., those who work in bone marrow transplant units). Although no immunocompromised patient has been shown to be harmed by use of LAIV among health care workers, the recommendation against the use of LAIV in health care workers with this type of patient contact is intended as an extra precaution for fragile immunocompromised patients. Health care workers with this type of patient contact can get LAIV, but if they do, they should wait 7 days after being vaccinated before returning to duties that include care of severely immunocompromised patients in special environments.\n\nCan health care personnel in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) get LAIV (live attenuated influenza vaccine)?\nYes. Either Adobe PDF file the inactivated injectable influenza vaccine or the LAIV can be given to health care personnel working in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Nearly all healthy, non-pregnant health care workers, including those who come in contact with newborn infants, pregnant women, persons with a solid organ transplant, persons receiving chemotherapy (not in preparation for a bone marrow transplant), and persons with HIV/AIDS, may receive LAIV if otherwise eligible. However, LAIV should not be used for health care personnel who care for patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (i.e., patients who require a protected environment).\n\nNo special precautions (e.g., masks or gloves) are necessary for health care personnel who have been vaccinated with the LAIV and who do not work with patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation. However, for health care personnel that were vaccinated with LAIV and who work with patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation, the ACIP recommends, as a precautionary measure, that those health care personnel avoid providing care for such patients for 7 days after vaccination.\n\nWho should not be vaccinated with the 2009 H1N1 nasal-spray flu vaccine LAIV?\nCertain people should not get a nasal spray flu vaccine, including the 2009 H1N1 nasal spray vaccine. This includes:\n\nPeople younger than 2 years of age;\nPregnant women;\nPeople 50 years of age and older;\nPeople with a medical condition that places them at higher risk for complications from influenza, including those with chronic heart or lung disease, such as asthma or reactive airways disease; people with medical conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure; or people with illnesses that weaken the immune system, or who take medications that can weaken the immune system;\nChildren younger than 5 years old with a history of recurrent wheezing;\nChildren or adolescents receiving aspirin therapy;\nPeople who have had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), a rare disorder of the nervous system, within 6 weeks of getting a flu vaccine,\nPeople who have a severe allergy to chicken eggs or who are allergic to any of the nasal spray vaccine components.\nShould the nasal-spray flu vaccine be given to patients with chronic diseases other than those specifically listed above?\nNo. The nasal-spray flu vaccine is approved for use only in healthy* people 2 years to 49 years of age who are not pregnant.\n\nAre there any contraindications to giving breastfeeding mothers the 2009 H1N1 vaccine?\nBreastfeeding is not a contraindication for the nasal spray flu vaccine. Women who are breastfeeding can get the nasal spray vaccine, including 2009 H1N1 vaccine.\n\nCan pregnant women be in contact with someone who has gotten the nasal spray vaccine (LAIV)?\nYes. A pregnant woman can be in close contact with someone who has gotten the nasal spray flu vaccine (LAIV). A pregnant woman can also administer (give) a nasal spray vaccine (LAIV). Because the viruses in the nasal spray vaccine are attenuated or weakened, vaccine viruses are unlikely to cause ny illness symptoms, even if an unvaccinated person inadvertently gets vaccine viruses in their nose. The nasal spray vaccine against seasonal influenza viruses has been used in millions of school children and healthy adults since it was licensed, and there have been no reports of pregnant women becoming ill after exposure to their vaccinated children or other family members.\n\nWhile it's OK for her contacts to get the nasal spray vaccine, this vaccine should not be given to pregnant women. While LAIV is not known to be a safety risk for pregnant women, there have not been studies of LAIV among pregnant women to assess safety and effectiveness for use in this group. LAIV can be given to women after they have delivered, even if they are nursing.\n\nCDC recommends that pregnant woman get both the 2009 H1N1 flu shot and the seasonal flu shot. Flu shots are made with a killed virus, and have not been shown to cause harm to pregnant women or their babies.\n\nCan the nasal-spray flu vaccine be given to patients when they are ill?\nThe nasal-spray flu vaccine can be given to people with minor illnesses (e.g., diarrhea or mild upper respiratory tract infection with or without fever). However, if nasal congestion is present that might limit delivery of the vaccine to the nasal lining, then delaying of vaccination until the nasal congestion is reduced should be considered.\n\nCan people receiving the nasal-spray flu vaccine LAIV pass the vaccine viruses to others?\nIn clinical studies, transmission of vaccine viruses to close contacts occurred only rarely. The current estimated risk of getting infected with vaccine virus after close contact with a person vaccinated with the nasal-spray flu vaccine is low (0.6%-2.4%). Because the viruses are weakened, infection is unlikely to result in influenza illness symptoms since the vaccine viruses have not been shown change into typical or naturally occurring influenza viruses.\n\nCan contacts of people with weakened immune systems get the nasal-spray flu vaccine?\nPeople who are in contact with others with severely weakened immune systems when they are being cared for in a protective environment (for example, people with hematopoietic stem cell transplants), should not get the nasal spray vaccine, including the 2009 H1N1 nasal spray vaccine if they will come into contact with the severely immunocompromised person within 7 days of vaccination. People who have contact with others with lesser degrees of immunosuppression (for example, people with diabetes, people with asthma taking corticosteroids, or people infected with HIV) can get the nasal spray vaccine.\n\nWhat side effects are associated with the nasal-spray flu vaccine?\nIn children, side effects can include runny nose, headache, wheezing, vomiting, muscle aches, and fever. In adults, side effects can include runny nose, headache, sore throat, and cough. Fever is not a common side effect in adults receiving the nasal spray flu vaccine.\n\nHow effective is the nasal-spray seasonal flu vaccine?\nIn one large study among children aged 15-85 months, the seasonal nasal-spray flu vaccine reduced the chance of influenza illness by 92% compared with placebo. In a study among adults, the participants were not specifically tested for influenza. However, the study found 19% fewer severe febrile respiratory tract illnesses, 24% fewer respiratory tract illnesses with fever, 23-27% fewer days of illness, 13-28% fewer lost work days, 15-41% fewer health care provider visits, and 43-47% less use of antibiotics compared with placebo.  A recent study suggested that seasonal LAIV may not be as effective as seasonal inactivated vaccine in adults, but more data are needed to confirm if one is better than the other. Both vaccines are expected to be effective against 2009 H1N1. \n\nWhen should the 2009 H1N1 nasal-spray flu vaccine be given?\nFlu vaccination should begin as soon as vaccine is available and continue throughout the influenza season, into December, January, and beyond. By early October 2009, extensive 2009 H1N1 flu activity was being reported in the United States. It\u2019s possible that there may be waves of 2009 H1N1 activity during the 2009-2010 flu season that hit communities more than once over the course of the influenza season, which typically peaks in January or February but can last as late as May.\n\nHow many doses of nasal spray vaccine are needed?\nIn adults, only one dose of 2009 H1N1 vaccine, including the 2009 H1N1 nasal spray vaccine, is needed for protection.\n\nAll children 2 through 9 years of age getting a 2009 H1N1 vaccine will need two doses of 2009 H1N1 vaccine (either the 2009 H1N1 flu shot or the 2009 H1N1 nasal spray vaccine), The first dose should being given as soon as vaccine becomes available. The second dose should be given 28 or more days after the first dose. The first dose \"primes\" the immune system; the second dose provides immune protection. Children who only get one dose of vaccine when they need two doses may have reduced or no protection. Be sure to follow up to get your child a second dose if they need one. It usually takes about two weeks after the second dose for protection to begin.\n\nCan people who got the flu shot last year get the nasal-spray flu vaccine LAIV this year?\nYes, people who got inactivated influenza vaccine (the flu shot) last year can get the nasal-spray flu vaccine this year.\n\nCan the nasal-spray flu vaccine be given at the same time as other vaccines?\nThe nasal spray flu vaccine can be given at the same time or around the same time as an inactivated (killed) vaccine or any other live vaccine except for the seasonal nasal spray vaccine. (The seasonal nasal spray vaccine and the 2009 H1N1 nasal spray vaccine should not be given at the same time.) The 2009 H1N1 flu shot (inactivated 2009 H1N1 vaccine) can be given at the same visit as any other vaccine, including pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.\n\nCan the 2009 H1N1 nasal spray vaccine and the seasonal nasal spray vaccine be given at the same time to the same person?\nNo. The seasonal nasal spray vaccine and the 2009 H1N1 nasal spray vaccine should not be given at the same time. This is because the nasal spray vaccines might not be as effective if given together. It is fine to receive the 2009 H1N1 nasal spray at the same time as the seasonal influenza (flu) shot, or the seasonal flu nasal spray at the same time as the 2009 H1N1 flu shot vaccine.\n\nCan the nasal-spray flu vaccine be used together with influenza antiviral medications?\nIf a person is taking an influenza antiviral drug (including Tamiflu\u00ae or Relenza\u00ae, then the nasal spray flu vaccine should not be given until 48 hours after the last dose of the influenza antiviral medication was given. If a person takes antiviral drugs within two weeks of getting the nasal spray flu vaccine, that person should get revaccinated. (The antiviral drugs will have killed the vaccine viruses that are supposed to cause the immune response against those viruses.)\n\nAntiviral drugs can be taken with the inactivated (i.e. killed) flu vaccine.\n\nIf a child under the age of 9 years is getting seasonal influenza vaccine for the first time and requires 2 doses, does the same type of vaccine have to be used for both doses?\nIdeally the same type of vaccine should be used for both doses as we know a series of two doses of the same type of vaccine has worked in clinical trials.  No information is available about how effective a series of two different vaccines might be.  If different types of vaccine are used for the first and second doses, however, there is no need to revaccinate a child.  The doses should be separated by at least one month (28 days).\n\nHow is the nasal-spray flu vaccine stored?\nThe nasal-spray flu vaccine, including both the seasonal and 2009 H1N1 nasal spray vaccines, must be stored in a refrigerator at 2-8\u00b0C (35-46\u00b0F).\n\nCan health care workers who cannot receive the nasal spray vaccine (e.g., pregnant women, older adults, persons with chronic medical conditions) administer this vaccine to others?\nYes. Health care workers who cannot get the nasal spray vaccine themselves can administer the vaccine to others.\n\nWhat personal protective equipment is recommended for health care workers who are giving the 2009 H1N1 nasal spray vaccine?\nPersonal protective equipment (gloves and masks) are not needed when administering the nasal spray vaccine, including the 2009 H1N1 nasal spray vaccine.\n\nDoes the nasal spray flu vaccine contain thimerosal?\nNo, neither the seasonal nor the 2009 H1N1 nasal-spray flu vaccines contain thimerosal or any other preservative.\n\nCan the nasal spray flu vaccine give you the flu?\nUnlike the flu shot, the nasal spray flu vaccine does contain live viruses. However, the viruses are attenuated (weakened) and cannot cause flu illness. The weakened viruses are cold-adapted, which means they are designed to only cause infection at the cooler temperatures found within the nose. The viruses cannot infect the lungs or other areas where warmer temperatures exist. Some children and young adults 2 years to 17 years of age have reported experiencing mild reactions after receiving seasonal nasal spray flu vaccine, including runny nose, nasal congestion or cough, chills, tiredness/weakness, sore throat and headache. Some adults 18 years to 49 years of age have reported runny nose or nasal congestion, cough, chills, tiredness/weakness, sore throat and headache. These side effects are mild and short-lasting, especially when compared to symptoms of influenza infection.\n\nWho makes the nasal spray vaccine?\nThe nasal spray vaccine for use in the United States is being made by MedImmune, the same company that makes the seasonal nasal spray vaccine called \u201cFluMist\u00ae.\u201d The 2009 H1N1 nasal spray vaccine is being made using the same manufacturing process that has been used since 2003 to make the seasonal nasal spray vaccine.",

Click here for instructions on how to open capsules and mix the medicine with liquids.\nTreatment Is Important for High Risk Groups\nPeople in high risk groups should talk to their health care provider as soon as possible if they think they may have the flu because they have a greater chance of getting serious flu complications than other persons. Flu antiviral drugs can make you feel better, shorten the time you are sick, and prevent serious flu complications, especially if treatment is begun within 2 days of getting sick. Flu antiviral drugs must be prescribed by a physician.\n\nDon\u2019t Delay Treatment\nIf your doctor prescribed Tamiflu\u00ae (oseltamivir) or Relenza\u00ae (zanamivir) for you, don\u2019t delay filling the prescription, and start taking the medication as soon as you get it. This way you will get the most benefit. It\u2019s very important that antiviral drugs be started as soon as possible for the flu, ideally within 2 days of getting sick.\n\nDon\u2019t Confuse Tamiflu\u00ae (oseltamivir) with Theraflu\u00ae\nTamiflu\u00ae is the brand name and oseltamivir is the generic name of a prescription antiviral drug used to treat the flu and should not be confused with Theraflu\u00ae, which is an over-the-counter medication. Antiviral drugs are not sold over-the-counter. You can only get them if you have a prescription from your health care provider.\n\nSide Effects of Flu Antiviral Drugs\nThe most common side effects of oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae) are nausea and vomiting, which can also be symptoms of the flu. Nausea and vomiting can be minimized by taking the medication with food. The most common side effects of zanamivir (Relenza\u00ae) are dizziness, sinusitis, runny or stuffy nose, cough, diarrhea, nausea, or headache, also symptoms that can be due to the flu. Zanamivir may also cause wheezing and trouble breathing in people with lung disease; therefore, persons with a history of asthma or another lung disease should not be prescribed zanamivir.\n\nTreatment May Be Needed Even if Test Results are Negative\nYour health care provider may diagnose you with flu based on your symptoms and their clinical judgment or they may choose to use an influenza diagnostic test. Health care providers can use rapid flu tests (15 minutes or less) to test a specimen from your nose or throat in their offices. Unfortunately, these tests are less than perfect in telling who really has the flu. Therefore, you could still have the flu, even though your rapid flu test result is negative. Health care providers may prescribe antivirals if they suspect flu, even if the rapid flu test is negative.",

            "HeadLine": "Revised U.S. Surveillance Case Definition for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Update on SARS Cases --- United States and Worldwide, December 2003",
            "Text": "During the 2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), CDC and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) developed surveillance criteria to identify persons with SARS. The surveillance case definition changed throughout the epidemic as understanding of the clinical, laboratory, and transmission characteristics of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) increased (1--5). On June 26, CSTE adopted a position statement to add SARS-CoV disease to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS). The position statement included criteria for defining a SARS case for national reporting. On November 3, CSTE issued a new interim position statement* with a revised SARS case definition. This report summarizes the new U.S. surveillance case definition for SARS and updates reported cases of SARS worldwide and in the United States.\n\nSummary of Changes to Case Definition\nThe revised SARS case definition (Box) modifies the clinical, epidemiologic, laboratory, and case-exclusion criteria in the U.S. surveillance case definition used during the 2003 epidemic. In the clinical criteria, \"early\" illness replaces \"asymptomatic\" or \"mild\" illness. The epidemiologic criteria include the following new categories: 1) possible exposure to SARS-CoV and 2) likely exposure to SARS-CoV. Laboratory criteria for evidence of SARS-CoV infection reflect advances in testing technology. The case-exclusion criteria have been changed to allow for exclusion when a serum sample collected >28 days after onset of symptoms is negative for antibody to SARS-CoV.\n\nThe revised case definition also classifies each SARS case as either a SARS report under investigation (SARS RUI) or SARS-CoV disease. SARS RUI is a sensitive, nonspecific case classification based solely on clinical or epidemiologic criteria and includes cases classified previously as probable or suspect. SARS-CoV disease is a more specific case classification based on selected clinical and epidemiologic criteria or laboratory confirmation. SARS RUIs might subsequently meet the definition for SARS-CoV disease based on results from laboratory testing (Tables 1 and 2).\n\nUpdate on SARS Cases\nDuring November 2002--July 2003, a total of 8,098 probable SARS cases were reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from 29 countries, including 29 cases from the United States; 774 SARS-related deaths (case-fatality rate: 9.6%) were reported, none of which occurred in the United States (6). Eight U.S. cases had serologic evidence of SARS-CoV infection; these eight cases have been described previously (7--10). A total of 156 reported U.S. SARS cases from the 2003 epidemic remain under investigation, with 137 (88%) cases classified according to previous surveillance criteria as suspect SARS and 19 (12%) classified as probable SARS. Because convalescent serum specimens have not been obtained from the 19 probable and 137 suspect cases that remain under investigation, whether these persons had SARS-CoV disease is unknown.\n\nReported by: SARS Team and Executive Committee, Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. SARS Investigative Team, CDC.\n\nEditorial Note:\nThe revised surveillance case definition for SARS reflects an improved understanding of the clinical and laboratory characteristics of SARS-CoV. The revision differentiates patients with nonspecific clinical illness or less definitive epidemiologic associations (i.e., SARS RUIs) from those with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV infection or more definitive epidemiologic links (i.e., cases of SARS-CoV disease). Local and state health departments will monitor SARS RUIs to ensure implementation of prompt public health measures for preventing disease transmission if SARS-CoV is confirmed subsequently. Numerous SARS RUIs probably will be excluded as SARS cases as laboratory results become available during the course of illness. Surveillance data for cases meeting the SARS-CoV disease case definition will be reported to NNDSS and included in the weekly statistical summary of notifiable infectious diseases in the United States published in MMWR (Table 1. Summary of provisional cases of selected notifiable diseases, United States).\n\nReporting of cases meeting previous SARS definitions ended in late July 2003. However, case numbers continue to change as new clinical information or results of additional laboratory testing on cases reported previously become available. Updated case counts reflecting these changes are available from CDC at http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/sars/cases.htm.\n\nEfforts are under way to prepare for a possible reappearance of SARS-CoV. CDC, in collaboration with other federal partners, state and local health officials, professional organizations and societies, and representatives of the health-care industry, has developed a guidance document to help public health and health-care officials detect the reappearance of SARS-CoV in the United States quickly and implement a decisive and effective public health response. The document, \"Public Health Guidance for Community-Level Preparedness and Response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS),\" is available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/sarsprepplan.htm.",

            "Text": "What is SARS?\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus, called SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS was first reported in Asia in February 2003. Over the next few months, the illness spread to more than two dozen countries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia before the SARS global outbreak of 2003 was contained. This fact sheet gives basic information about the illness and what CDC did to control SARS in the United States.\n\nFind out more about SARS:\n\nCDC\nWorld Health OrganizationExternal\nThe SARS outbreak of 2003\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), a total of 8,098 people worldwide became sick with SARS during the 2003 outbreak. Of these, 774 died. In the United States, only eight people had laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV infection. All of these people had traveled to other parts of the world where SARS was spreading. SARS did not spread more widely in the community in the United States. See an update on SARS cases in the United States and worldwide as of December 2003.\n\n Top of Page\n\nSymptoms of SARS\nIn general, SARS begins with a high fever (temperature greater than 100.4\u00b0F [>38.0\u00b0C]). Other symptoms may include headache, an overall feeling of discomfort, and body aches. Some people also have mild respiratory symptoms at the outset. About 10 percent to 20 percent of patients have diarrhea. After 2 to 7 days, SARS patients may develop a dry cough. Most patients develop pneumonia.\n\nHow SARS spreads\nThe main way that SARS seems to spread is by close person-to-person contact. The virus that causes SARS is thought to be transmitted most readily by respiratory droplets (droplet spread) produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Droplet spread can happen when droplets from the cough or sneeze of an infected person are propelled a short distance (generally up to 3 feet) through the air and deposited on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, or eyes of persons who are nearby. The virus also can spread when a person touches a surface or object contaminated with infectious droplets and then touches his or her mouth, nose, or eye(s). In addition, it is possible that the SARS virus might spread more broadly through the air (airborne spread) or by other ways that are not now known.\n\nWhat does \u201cclose contact\u201d mean?\nIn the context of SARS, close contact means having cared for or lived with someone with SARS or having direct contact with respiratory secretions or body fluids of a patient with SARS. Examples of close contact include kissing or hugging, sharing eating or drinking utensils, talking to someone within 3 feet, and touching someone directly. Close contact does not include activities like walking by a person or briefly sitting across a waiting room or office. CDC\u2019s response to SARS during the 2003 outbreak\nCDC worked closely with WHO and other partners in a global effort to address the SARS outbreak of 2003. For its part, CDC took the following actions:\n\nActivated its Emergency Operations Center to provide round-the-clock coordination and response.\nCommitted more than 800 medical experts and support staff to work on the SARS response.\nDeployed medical officers, epidemiologists, and other specialists to assist with on-site investigations around the world.\nProvided assistance to state and local health departments in investigating possible cases of SARS in the United States.\nConducted extensive laboratory testing of clinical specimens from SARS patients to identify the cause of the disease.\nInitiated a system for distributing health alert notices to travelers who may have been exposed to cases of SARS.",

            "HeadLine": "Frequently Asked Questions About SARS",
            "Text": "The Disease\nWhat is SARS?\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory illness that was recognized as a global threat in March 2003, after first appearing in Southern China in November 2002.\n\nWhat are the symptoms and signs of SARS?\nThe illness usually begins with a high fever (measured temperature greater than 100.4\u00b0F [>38.0\u00b0C]). The fever is sometimes associated with chills or other symptoms, including headache, general feeling of discomfort, and body aches. Some people also experience mild respiratory symptoms at the outset. Diarrhea is seen in approximately 10 percent to 20 percent of patients. After 2 to 7 days, SARS patients may develop a dry, nonproductive cough that might be accompanied by or progress to a condition in which the oxygen levels in the blood are low (hypoxia). In 10 percent to 20 percent of cases, patients require mechanical ventilation. Most patients develop pneumonia.\n\nWhat is the cause of SARS?\nSARS is caused by a previously unrecognized coronavirus, called SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It is possible that other infectious agents might have a role in some cases of SARS.\n\nHow is SARS spread?\nThe primary way that SARS appears to spread is by close person-to-person contact. SARS-CoV is thought to be transmitted most readily by respiratory droplets (droplet spread) produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Droplet spread can happen when droplets from the cough or sneeze of an infected person are propelled a short distance (generally up to 3 feet) through the air and deposited on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, or eyes of persons who are nearby. The virus also can spread when a person touches a surface or object contaminated with infectious droplets and then touches his or her mouth, nose, or eye(s). In addition, it is possible that SARS-CoV might be spread more broadly through the air (airborne spread) or by other ways that are not now known.\n\nWhat does \u201cclose contact\u201d mean?\nClose contact is defined as having cared for or lived with a person known to have SARS or having a high likelihood of direct contact with respiratory secretions and/or body fluids of a patient known to have SARS. Examples include kissing or embracing, sharing eating or drinking utensils, close conversation (within 3 feet), physical examination, and any other direct physical contact between people. Close contact does not include activities such as walking by a person or briefly sitting across a waiting room or office.\n\nIf I were exposed to SARS-CoV, how long would it take for me to become sick?\nThe time between exposure to SARS-CoV and the onset of symptoms is called the \u201cincubation period.\u201d The incubation period for SARS is typically 2 to 7 days, although in some cases it may be as long as 10 days. In a very small proportion of cases, incubation periods of up to 14 days have been reported.\n\nHow long is a person with SARS infectious to others?\nAvailable information suggests that persons with SARS are most likely to be contagious only when they have symptoms, such as fever or cough. Patients are most contagious during the second week of illness. However, as a precaution against spreading the disease, CDC recommends that persons with SARS limit their interactions outside the home (for example, by not going to work or to school) until 10 days after their fever has gone away and their respiratory (breathing) symptoms have gotten better.\n\nIs a person with SARS contagious before symptoms appear?\nTo date, no cases of SARS have been reported among persons who were exposed to a SARS patient before the onset of the patient\u2019s symptoms.\n\nWhat medical treatment is recommended for patients with SARS?\nCDC recommends that patients with SARS receive the same treatment that would be used for a patient with any serious community-acquired atypical pneumonia. SARS-CoV is being tested against various antiviral drugs to see if an effective treatment can be found.\n\nIf there is another outbreak of SARS, how can I protect myself?\nIf transmission of SARS-CoV recurs, there are some common-sense precautions that you can take that apply to many infectious diseases. The most important is frequent hand washing with soap and water or use of an alcohol-based hand rub. You should also avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unclean hands and encourage people around you to cover their nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. Global SARS Outbreak, 2003\nHow many people contracted SARS worldwide during the 2003 outbreak? How many people died of SARS worldwide?\nDuring November 2002 through July 2003, a total of 8,098 people worldwide became sick with severe acute respiratory syndrome that was accompanied by either pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome (probable cases), according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Of these, 774 died. By late July 2003, no new cases were being reported, and WHO declared the global outbreak to be over. For more information on the global SARS outbreak of 2003, visit WHO\u2019s SARS websiteExternal.\n\nHow many people contracted SARS in the United States during the 2003 outbreak? How many people died of SARS in the United States?\nIn the United States, only eight persons were laboratory-confirmed as SARS cases. There were no SARS-related deaths in the United States. All of the eight persons with laboratory-confirmed SARS had traveled to areas where SARS-CoV transmission was occurring. SARS Situation, 2004\nUpdated Apr 26, 2004\n\nWhat is the current SARS situation in the world?\nIn April 2004, the Chinese Ministry of Health reported several new cases of possible SARS in Beijing and in Anhui Province, which is located in east-central China. As of April 26, the Ministry of Health had reported eight possible SARS cases: six in Bejing and two in Anhui Province. One of the patients in Anhui Province died. Nearly 1000 contacts of these patients with possible SARS are under medical observation, including 640 in Beijing and 353 in Anhui.\n\nIn addition, health authorities have reported that two doctors who treated one of one of the patients during her hospitalization in Anhui have developed fever. A person in close contact with one of the doctors has also developed fever.\n\nTo date, all diagnosed cases and cases under investigation have been linked to chains of transmission involving close personal contact with an identified case. There is no evidence of wider transmission in the community. Additional information on the SARS situation in ChinaExternal.\n\nCDC is monitoring this evolving situation in China and will provide additional information on this website as it becomes available.\n\nAt this time, CDC is not advising changes in the current U.S. SARS control measures other than the recommendations stated in the HAN Information Update for April 23. This update contains additional details about the reported SARS cases. For updates on the current situation regarding SARS, refer to other pages on CDC\u2019s SARS website. Travel information is provided on CDC\u2019s Travelers\u2019 Health website. SARS-Associated Coronavirus\nWhat are coronaviruses?\nCoronaviruses are a group of viruses that have a halo or crown-like (corona) appearance when viewed under a microscope. These viruses are a common cause of mild to moderate upper-respiratory illness in humans and are associated with respiratory, gastrointestinal, liver and neurologic disease in animals.\n\nIf coronaviruses usually cause mild illness in humans, how could this new coronavirus be responsible for a potentially life-threatening disease such as SARS?\nThere is not enough information about the new virus to determine the full range of illness that it might cause. Coronaviruses have occasionally been linked to pneumonia in humans, especially people with weakened immune systems. The viruses also can cause severe disease in animals, including cats, dogs, pigs, mice, and birds.\n\nHow long can SARS-CoV survive in the environment?\nPreliminary studies in some research laboratories suggest that the virus may survive in the environment for several days. The length of time that the virus survives likely depends on a number of factors. These factors could include the type of material or body fluid containing the virus and various environmental conditions such as temperature or humidity. Researchers at CDC and other institutions are designing standardized experiments to measure how long SARS-CoV can survive in situations that simulate natural environmental conditions. Laboratory Testing\nIs there a laboratory test for SARS?\nYes, several laboratory tests can be used to detect SARS-CoV. A reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test can detect SARS-CoV in clinical specimens such as blood, stool, and nasal secretions. Serologic testing also can be performed to detect SARS-CoV antibodies produced after infection. Finally, viral culture has been used to detect SARS-CoV.\n\nWhat is a PCR test?\nPCR (or polymerase chain reaction) is a laboratory method for detecting the genetic material of an infectious disease agent in specimens from patients. This type of testing has become an essential tool for detecting infectious disease agents.\n\nWhat does serologic testing involve?\nA serologic test is a laboratory method for detecting the presence and/or level of antibodies to an infectious agent in serum from a person. Antibodies are substances made by the body\u2019s immune system to fight a specific infection.\n\nWhat does viral culture and isolation involve?\nFor a viral culture, a small sample of tissue or fluid that may be infected is placed in a container along with cells in which the virus can grow. If the virus grows in the culture, it will cause changes in the cells that can be seen under a microscope.",

We still have a lot to do. We need to find the cause. We have to look at the treatment.\"\n\nBekedam told reporters that while he thinks health officials are getting a lot closer in learning how to prevent the disease, the key of the moment \"is how to contain it.\"\n\nExpert health officials spent six days in Guangdong Province, which is considered to be the epicenter of the disease. The first SARS case was reported in Guangdong Province last November.\n\nWhile there, the doctors spoke to local health officials, visited hospitals and spent time with SARS patients.\n\nCNN's Steven Jiang reports that health officials have been looking at various theories on how the disease is contracted and spread.\n\nJiang says one focus is on the type of patient health officials are calling the \"super spreader\" -- a person who is highly infectious, capable of infecting significantly more people than most other patients.\n\nHealth officials told reporters about a patient in China who affected more than a dozen health officials who treated him.\n\nA second theory health officials are looking into is whether SARS is actually a combination of viruses.\n\nYet another theory has health officials looking into any link between SARS and the coronavirus family, which is typically found in animals.\n\nChina on Thursday said its death toll from SARS has risen by two to 55, and the total number of people infected stands at 1,290.\n\nThe international community has criticized the Chinese government during the past few months for their alleged cover-up of SARS, saying it should have reported the situation in Guangdong to the rest of the world sooner.\n\nHong Kong has been the region hardest hit by SARS outside of the Chinese mainland. The disease has infected at least 970 people there, killing 27, out of a total of more than 2,600 cases worldwide that have claimed at least 106 deaths.\n\nHong Kong authorities were closely monitoring 30 cases of the mystery illness at a Kowloon Bay housing estate, the Lower Ngau Tau Kok apartments, which house around 10,000 residents.\n\nThe Lower Ngau Tau Kok cases have prompted authorities to add cockroaches to the list of suspected spreaders of the disease. Cats, rats and leaky sewage systems are also under investigation.\n\nIn other developments: \u2022 In Canada, Chinese-Canadians reported they were being discriminated against by those in fear of the virus. At least 226 people have been infected there, with 10 reported SARS deaths.\n\n\u2022 The Roman Catholic church in Singapore has suspended confessions due to the SARS spread. The city-state has the world's fourth highest number of confirmed cases (118) and nine deaths. The military is now being used to help fight the spread of the disease while Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said SARS would hit economic growth by up to one percent. (Military call-up)\n\n\u2022 The SARS outbreak continued to hit the travel and tourism industry. Australian carrier Qantas announced on Wednesday it would shed 1,400 staff due to a fall in passenger numbers from both the war in Iraq and the SARS disease. (Qantas cuts)\n\n\u2022 A 62-year-old South African man is being treated at a Pretoria hospital as a \"probable SARS\" case, according to officials involved in the case. (Full story)\n\n\u2022 Malaysia has stopped issuing entry visas to most Chinese travelers to curb SARS, the Associated Press reported on Wednesday. Malaysia has reported one fatal case of the illness.\n\n\u2022 Taiwan has again hit out at the WHO's failure to allow experts monitor the SARS outbreak on the island. The WHO, like the U.N., does not recognize the island. Taipei also criticized Beijing for not allowing the WHO to work with Taiwanese authorities. Taiwan argues a lack of assistance has hindered efforts to control the virus there. There were 20 suspected SARS cases in Taiwan as of Wednesday but no deaths have been recorded.",

But one group has so far come through virtually untouched -- children.\n\nDoctors are trying to explain why a virus that moves with relative ease through the adult population, so far infecting 3,000 worldwide with more than 100 dead, has come up against something of an immunological wall when it comes to youngsters.\n\nIn the south China city of Guangzhou, just miles from where the outbreak began, Guangzhou Children's Hospital has yet to see its first patient with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), officials said this week.\n\n\"We haven't had any cases of SARS,\" said Yu Minghua, chief of paediatrics at south China's largest hospital for children.\n\n\"No one has died and no one has been on a respirator...This hospital has about 300 doctors, and none of them has got SARS either.\"\n\nChina, especially southern Guangdong province where the disease emerged in November, has been criticized by the World Health Organization for not fully reporting the real number of SARS cases early enough.\n\nBut the resistance of children to SARS is a phenomenon that is seen in other places where the disease has struck hardest.\n\nIn Singapore, just three of the 126 cases to date, or 2.4 percent, are children under the age of 18, according to government data published on Thursday.\n\nOut of about 1,000 sufferers in Hong Kong, \"the number of children infected with SARS is low... and they had close contacts with SARS patients before infection,\" Hong Kong's Department of Health told Reuters in a statement. It said more specific data was not available.\n\nA Chinese official could not say how many of the 1,206 people who have come down with the disease in Guangdong were children.\n\nBut Yu said that no children with SARS had come through her hospital, as one might suspect, before being transferred to Guangzhou's No 8 People's Hospital where many of the city's SARS sufferers have been quarantined.\n\nSchools closed\nJust two weeks ago, when first Singapore and then Hong Kong closed schools to prevent the disease's spread, less was known about who gets the disease.\n\nThe Hong Kong suspension of classes was later extended through the Easter holidays, while Singapore began a graduated reopening of its schools on Wednesday.\n\nThe latest research, published by two teams in the new England Journal of Medicine on Thursday, identifies the virus as a completely new version of the coronavirus family, the infection that causes the common cold, among other diseases.\n\nTo date, however, doctors have found no clear evidence that SARS is spread through children-to-children contact either in or outside schools, said C.K. Li, a paediatrician at Prince of Wales Hospital, where most of Hong Kong's first SARS cases came.\n\n\"Initially when I saw the first one or two cases (of children with SARS) I was in great worry that they would spread that disease within the schools,\" he said. \"But that has never happened within Hong Kong.\"\n\nHong Kong's school officials must still decide whether to extend the suspension of classes beyond April 22, when they are set to reopen.\n\nDeng Li, who heads the respiratory department at Guangzhou Children's Hospital, said it was not uncommon for children to get some respiratory diseases that adults don't get and vice versa, and that may be the case with SARS.\n\nHong Kong's C.K. Li said that children may, in fact, get SARS at proportionate rates to their share of the population, but that their cases may be less debilitating.\n\n\"We probably see quite a similar number of children who are affected as adults,\" he said. \"But...it seems that young children are not so severely affected.\"",

Guangdong is an area with a history of incubating infectious diseases because of the close contact between animals and humans.\n\nAt one juncture, authorities had warned the virus could become a pandemic as it was very virulent, survived for hours on an inanimate object, spread though faulty drainpipes, and was shown to infect entire hospital wards if workers did not follow infection guidelines.\n\nSARS is still a dangerous disease, experts say, as it has no reliable diagnostic test and there is no cure in sight. What's more one single case or lapse in infection control could re-ignite an outbreak.\n\nCanada, for one, thought it had SARS under control, but a series of cases emerged in late May after it had been declared SARS-free.\n\nHealth authorities around the world are also worried that SARS could re-emerge in winter months, when respiratory diseases are rife.\n\nThe WHO has pointed to serious deficiencies in surveillance and control systems in a number of locations. Many countries do not have a centralized information clearing house like the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nChina at first tried to downplay its outbreak, but made a stunning turnaround, firing its health minister and the major of Beijing. The global spread of SARS has been blamed partly on an information blackout in the early days of the epidemic.\n\nWhile travel advisories have been lifted for several Chinese provinces, it is unclear when Beijing might be cleared as it still has many SARS cases, senior WHO officials have said.\n\nThe top Chinese delegate to the conference, Vice Minister for Health Gao Qiang, admitted on Tuesday that Beijing's initial response was \"inadequate.\"\n\nThe Chinese government has made eradicating SARS its priority, Gao said.\n\nThe WHO says it is clear that certain steps have proven effective in tracing, identifying, and isolating those who either have the disease or have come into contact with someone who does.\n\nCountries that have taken the most thorough and rigorous steps, such as Singapore and Vietnam, have managed the disease more quickly than others, the WHO says.\n\nWhile many disease experts disagree over whether it is reasonable to think SARS can be eradicated, they all say any kind of cure or vaccine preventing it is years away.",

It's going to be some really tough work ahead of us.\"\n\nThe situation in Canada is far less disturbing than that in mainland China, where 1,959 cases and 86 deaths have been reported. \"We're going to have to consider\" an outright ban on travel there, he said.\n\n\"It's just a disaster in China, and it's becoming one in Hong Kong.

It apparently started China or Southeast Asia and has been spread by infected air travelers to Europe and Canada.\n\nHealth officials cautioned that SARS' symptoms -- a fever above 100.4 degrees F (38 C), a dry cough, and difficulty breathing -- are common at this time of year. The most important factors are recent travel to Asia, close contact with someone who recently traveled to the area or close contact with a health care worker.\n\nThe CDC said Wednesday that 40 people in the United States reported symptoms, but only 11 had the recent travel history to justify their placement into medical isolation.\n\n\"It is too early to tell if it's SARS,\" CDC Director Dr. Julie Gerberding said. \"Anyone with pneumonia and a travel history is going to be under investigation. ... If you've not gone there, don't be concerned about it at this point.\"\n\nChinese authorities reported the same syndrome or a similar one in November in Guangdong Province. That outbreak peaked in mid-February after killing five of the 350 people infected.\n\nThe World Health Organization lists another 264 SARS cases and nine deaths reported from February 1 to March 18. Cases have been reported in Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Canada, Britain, Germany, Spain and Slovenia.\n\nSARS is spread from person to person, but apparently only through close contact, possibly through \"respiratory secretions and body fluids,\" the CDC said.\n\nNearly all the cases of documented transmission have occurred among family members and health workers involved in the direct care of people suspected of having SARS, according to health experts.\n\nDoctors at WHO and the CDC had said Tuesday that preliminary results of tests indicated a link between SARS and the virus class known as paramyxovirus (prono: para-mix-o-virus).\n\nScientists stressed that even if SARS patients have been infected with a paramyxovirus, that doesn't necessarily mean it is the virus causing the atypical pneumonia -- the patients also could be infected with another organism that might be the culprit.\n\nParamyxoviruses cause several respiratory diseases in humans and animals. One of the viruses, parainfluenza, infects almost all children before they reach their fifth birthday, causing illnesses ranging from colds to pneumonia, according to the National Institutes of Health.",

Fearful of its rapid spread, the U.S. State Department has authorized departure for nonessential personnel and their families in China.\n\nIt is a voluntary measure for diplomats and their families, who have been given free flights out of the country.\n\nThe U.S. military has also banned its personnel from traveling to Hong Kong and mainland China although no one in the United States has died from the disease.\n\nIn some positive news, a WHO scientist David Mansoor said the Singapore outbreak \"is almost certainly over,\" but one to two weeks were needed before it could know for sure.\n\nFive people have died and 100 have been infected in recent weeks in the city state, which has shut all schools and quarantined hundreds. \nSingapore's health ministry officials said nearly all infections have been traced to Esther Mok, a former air stewardess, who caught the virus during a stay at a Hong Kong hotel in February.\n\nIn other developments:\n\n\u2022 Australian health officials report three children who arrived from Canada may have contracted SARS.\n\n\u2022 Hong Kong airport officials say airlines have canceled 18 percent of flights into and out of the territory after a WHO warning.\n\n\u2022 Japan reports three possible new cases, bringing its total to 17.

The measures have been fueling panic buying among residents in this city of 14 million people.\n\nCity officials said they expect the behavior to subside because there is a sufficient supply of food and goods to meet the public's needs.\n\nRumors that authorities are planning to declare martial law in Beijing or close the city's airports and highways have circulated on the Internet and over mobile phones. A city government spokesman dismissed them as \"rumors spread by people with ulterior motives.\"\n\nA third hospital was sealed on Friday, according to Associated Press. The closure of the Ditan Hospital in northern Beijing came less than two weeks after reporters were allowed to tour the facility, touted then as a showcase of the government's SARS preparedness.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear how many patients and staff were in the hospital, which has 500 beds and 643 staff.\n\nAt least 42 people in the capital have died of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and 115 people have died across China since officials began tracking the disease. Five new deaths were reported on Friday.\n\nAn additional 180 new cases were added to China's soaring tally of sufferers, with the nation's official SARS count standing at 2,601. More than 750 of those cases are in Beijing alone.\n\nThe increasingly urgent steps in China come as the mortality rate creeps up in neighboring Hong Kong.\n\nOfficials in the former British colony -- the hardest-hit area along with mainland China -- on Thursday revised the death rate from SARS to 7.2 percent from 5 percent.\n\nSome experts say it could rise higher because the rate is calculated by including those patients still being treated in hospital.\n\nWhile 614 people out of 1,510 have recovered in the territory of 6.7 million people, 105 are still in intensive care. Hong Kong reported six more deaths on Friday, bringing its toll to 115.\n\nBeyond Hong Kong, experts are unable to explain why SARS seems more virulent, with the global mortality rate creeping up to 5.9 percent from less than 4 percent three weeks ago.\n\nWorldwide, there are now over 4,000 cases, and more than 250 people have died from the virus, a respiratory infection caused by a relative of a common cold virus.\n\nOne suggestion is the coronavirus that causes the disease could have mutated into a more virulent form, but Dr. Julie Hall from the WHO said there was no evidence this has happened.\n\nIn the past week, people in their 30s and 40s with no history of illness have been dying from SARS in Hong Kong. Doctors are treating patients with a cocktail of antivirals and steroids, but as yet there is no cure.\n\nSome experts have expressed concern that along with hitting the respiratory system, the virus may be striking the intestines.\n\nIn Singapore, Health Minister Lim Hng Kiang told The Associated Press 8 to 9 percent of the island's SARS patients are dying.\n\nThe city-state, which reported two new deaths on Thursday, is refurbishing a drug rehabilitation camp to hold anyone who violates a harsh order to stay under home quarantine.\n\nDiscord\nMeanwhile, in a rare display of discord between health agencies, the director of the U.S. Center for Disease Control disagreed with the WHO's recommendation that all non-essential travel to Toronto be delayed until the SARS outbreak there has abated.\n\nThe WHO has refused to downgrade its travel warning to Toronto, even though Canadian officials have lambasted the warning as ridiculous. (Full story)\n\nWhile Toronto has far fewer cases than China and only 16 deaths, Canada has reported more SARS cases than any other country outside the Asian region.\n\nThe WHO says Canada had exported SARS to other countries, including America, Australia and the Philippines and will only lower the alert if no new cases have occurred in a three week period.\n\nIn other developments:\n\n\u2022 Talks have opened in Malaysia on ways to halt the virus. Senior officials from Southeast Asian countries are attending, along with representatives from China, Hong Kong and the WHO.\n\n\u2022 Health officials in the Philippines say the country has had its first two deaths from SARS, and another two people are infected. The numbers are not included in the latest WHO tally.\n\n\u2022 Reports in Britain say insurers are withdrawing cover for travel to some countries hit by SARS.\n\n\u2022 Authorities in Taiwan have quarantined over 1,000 doctors, nurses and patients in a hospital to halt the spread of the deadly flu-like disease, according to Reuters.",

One building in the complex accounted for more than half of those cases and was evacuated last week.\n\nAround 240 residents were sent for 10 days to makeshift quarantine centers. The quarantine period expires on Wednesday but many Amoy Gardens tenants have expressed fears that their homes remain unsafe.\n\nThe Lower Ngau Tau Kok cases have prompted authorities to add cockroaches to the list of suspected spreaders of the disease. Cats, rats and leaky sewage systems are also under investigation.\n\nAcross the border in China, the government was accused Wednesday by doctors of continuing to under-report the number of SARS cases.\n\nBeijing has already been under fire for covering up the severity of a SARS outbreak in the southern province of Guangdong. SARS cases first developed there last November but were only reported in February.\n\nBowing to international pressure, China admitted there were more cases than it initially acknowledged and is providing daily updates. The government also maintains the outbreak is under control.\n\nHowever, in a letter sent to journalists, a Chinese military doctor said six people had died of SARS and 60 had been infected at a military-run hospital in Beijing.\n\nSeveral doctors said epidemic wards at several hospitals were full with suspected SARS patients and one hospital was forced to shut its door to outpatients for a week, the Reuters news agency reported.\n\nThe letter from Jiang Yanyong said many health workers were angry when Health Minister Zhang Wenkang told a news conference last Thursday that Beijing had only 12 cases, of whom three died.\n\n\"A failure to disclose accurate statistics about the illness will only lead to more deaths,\" Jiang was quoted as saying by Time Magazine.\n\nBeijing has reported a total of 19 cases and four deaths out of 1,279 infections and 53 deaths nationwide, most of those in Guangdong.\n\nIn other developments:  Dr David Heymann of the World Health Organization told a U.S. Senate committee on Monday the epidemic could have been controlled if Chinese authorities had asked for help in November.\n\n\u2022 The WHO will release details of its investigation in Guangdong on Wednesday.\n\n\u2022 In Canada, Chinese-Canadians reported they were being discriminated against by those in fear of the virus. At least 226 people have been infected there, with 10 reported SARS deaths.\n\n\u2022 The Roman Catholic church in Singapore has suspended confessions due to the SARS spread. The city-state has the world's fourth highest number of confirmed cases and nine deaths. The military is now being used to help fight the spread of the disease while Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said SARS would hit economic growth by up to one percent. (Military call-up)\n\n\u2022 The SARS outbreak continued to hit the travel and tourism industry. Australian carrier Qantas announced on Wednesday it would shed 1,400 staff due to a fall in passenger numbers from both the war in Iraq and the SARS disease. (Qantas cuts)\n\n\u2022 A 62-year-old South African man is being treated at a Pretoria hospital as a \"probable SARS\" case, according to officials involved in the case. (Full story)\n\n\u2022 Malaysia has stopped issuing entry visas to most Chinese travelers to curb SARS, the Associated Press reported on Wednesday. Malaysia has reported one fatal case of the illness.\n\n\u2022 Taiwan has again hit out at the WHO's failure to allow experts monitor the SARS outbreak on the island. The WHO, like the U.N., does not recognize the island. Taipei also criticized Beijing for not allowing the WHO to work with Taiwanese authorities. Taiwan argues a lack of assistance has hindered efforts to control the virus there. There were 20 suspected SARS cases in Taiwan as of Wednesday but no deaths have been recorded.",

Numbers are posted there through Friday.\n\nSaturday, the Chinese Ministry of Health reported an increase in cases for the mainland -- 2,914 -- and 131 deaths. In Beijing, there were 126 new cases, for a total of 1,114, the ministry reported. There have been 56 deaths. Of the 1,114 confirmed cases, 187 are medical workers, officials said.\n\nBeijing officials are setting aside a 98-acre area in the city suburbs for quarantine use.\n\nLast week, Beijing decreed it would quarantine people or public places suspected of SARS infection, invoking emergency powers. The measures prompted panic buying and hoarding in some areas among people who fear food shortages or forced quarantine.\n\nSunday morning, traffic was light, and a local Catholic cathedral had canceled Sunday Masses. Many have taken to riding bicycles through the city in lieu of public transport so as to avoid contact with others.\n\nHealth ministers from several Asian nations held a meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Saturday to discuss ways to stem the global outbreak.\n\n\"SARS has already started to impact adversely on our economies,\" said Chua Jui Meng, Malaysia's health minister. \"At the same time, fears arising from the uncertainties of the disease are jeopardizing the tranquility of all our societies.\"\n\nVietnam, another Asian country hard-hit by SARS, may in fact be removed from the WHO's list of countries affected by the disease if it reaches the end of the month without a new case. No new cases of SARS have been detected in the country since April 8, WHO said, and April 30 would mark two incubation periods with no new case. (Full story)\n\nAmid an outcry from Canadian officials over WHO's travel advisory for Toronto, the agency confirmed Saturday it will review whether to rescind it.\n\nThat would appease local authorities who said the advisory has crushed the tourist industry and did not give Canada enough credit for its sophisticated public health infrastructure. (Full story)\n\nThe spread in Toronto also led at least four major cruise lines to ask passengers who have recently visited the city to undergo medical screenings before boarding the ships.\n\nAs of Saturday, there were 4,836 cases of SARS worldwide, with 293 deaths, according to WHO figures.\n\nLarge wedding parties discouraged\nIn Beijing, meanwhile, the disease is putting a heavy strain on hospitals, with at least three city medical centers sealed off because of SARS infections, officials said.\n\nIn addition to the shutdown of theaters, karaoke bars, Internet cafes, and public libraries, Beijing suspended the approval of marriages so as to discourage large wedding parties.\n\nThe measures were some of the immediate effects of Saturday's vote by the National People's Congress to replace the Chinese health minister with Vice Premier Wu Yi, who is seen as a tough administrator and negotiator.\n\nShe replaced Zhang Wenkang, who was dismissed from his Communist Party post last week amid criticism that he failed to respond quickly enough to the rapid spread of SARS and that he underreported the number of cases.\n\nBeijing Mayor Meng Xuenong was also dismissed.\n\nWu has vowed that the Chinese government will spend $420 million to establish a nationwide health network to battle SARS and other infectious diseases.\n\nThe government has also allocated $240 million for emergency medical treatment for SARS patients who can't pay for services.\n\nChina was the first country in which SARS appeared; an outbreak began in Guangdong Province last November. The second country affected was Vietnam.\n\nWHO staff credited the quick response of Vietnam's public health community and its government for halting the disease's spread.\n\n\"The government showed strong commitment at the highest level from the beginning of the outbreak,\" the statement said. \"Task forces and provincial teams were established and have worked well. Good procedures of infection control were rapidly established and eventually proved effective in preventing further spread among hospital staff.\"\n\nWHO's removal of Vietnam from the list of SARS-affected countries would be a boon for its tourism industry, which has suffered in Canada because of the outbreak there.\n\nWHO's advisory urges all but essential travel to Toronto be delayed until the SARS outbreak has abated. Its issue Wednesday sparked furor among Canadian political and health officials, who said it was an overreaction to a disease that is largely contained.\n\nOntario has been traced as the source of SARS cases in the United States, Australia and the Philippines, and the WHO is investigating a possible case spread to Bulgaria.\n\nSaturday, four major U.S. cruise lines announced they would mandate medical screening for passengers who have traveled to Toronto before they may board.\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises, Carnival Cruise Lines, Disney Cruise Line, and Princess Cruises had already denied boarding to anyone who has been in or traveled through mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore or Vietnam because of the disease.\n\nAnd while they will not automatically deny boarding for guests who have been to Toronto, they are requiring them to be screened.\n\n\"We talk to them as they check in,\" said Disney spokesman Mark Jaronski. The nurse will then ask them questions about their travel to the Canadian city.\n\nSARS appears to spread primarily through close person-to-person contact, the CDC says. Most cases have involved people who cared for or lived with someone with SARS, or had direct contact with infectious material from an infected person.\n\nAs a result, closed-in areas such as subways, buses, airplanes and cruise ships have come under special scrutiny as officials work to stem the disease's spread.\n\nIn general, SARS begins with a fever of at least 100.4 Fahrenheit degrees (38 Celsius). Other symptoms may include headache, an overall feeling of discomfort, body aches, and mild respiratory symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAfter two to seven days, SARS patients may develop a dry cough and have trouble breathing, the CDC says.\n\nApproximately 94 percent of people with SARS recover from it.",

In Hong Kong, the territory's leader on Thursday hailed the lifting of a U.S. travel advisory as proof it was recovering from the virus, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAnd with only new case being reported in Taiwan, the three areas of the world worst-hit by SARS appear to be on the road to recovery.\n\nBetween them, they have suffered about 90 percent of the 8,402 probable cases of SARS, with 772 fatalities, reported in more than two dozen countries since SARS first emerged.",

About 50 percent of untreated cases die of the disease.\n\nBased on the new data, the mortality rate for SARS varies widely by age:\n\n- Less than 1 percent in persons 24 years or younger;\n\n- Six percent in persons 25 to 44 years;\n\n- Fifteen percent in persons 45 to 64; and\n\n- Greater than 50 percent in persons 65 and older.\n\nIn addition, the mortality rate varied from country to country:\n\n- Eleven percent to 17 percent in Hong Kong;\n\n- Thirteen percent to 15 percent in Singapore;\n\n- Fifteen percent to 19 percent in Canada;\n\n- Five percent to 13 percent in mainland China; and\n\n- Eight percent in Vietnam.\n\nGlobally, SARS has infected more than 6,900 people, killing almost 500, according to the WHO.\n\nIn the United States, 65 cases have been reported, but there have been no deaths, according to WHO.\n\nEconomic antidotes in China\nIn China, the scourge shows no sign of abating, and the government is taking steps to boost the economy in the wake of travel warnings that have triggered a slowdown in tourism, state media reported Thursday.\n\nWHO extended new travel warnings to Tianjin and Inner Mongolia in China and Taipei in Taiwan. Past warnings included Beijing, Hong Kong and the Shanxi and Guangdong provinces.\n\nChina's Ministry of Health confirmed 146 new cases on Thursday, bringing the total to 4,698, and five new deaths, raising the death toll to 224. The ministry said 94 of the new cases and two of the deaths occurred in Beijing.\n\nIn a State Council meeting, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao offered a series of measures to mitigate the negative impact of the SARS outbreak on the national economy, which had been forecast to grow 7 percent this year.\n\nWestern economists have estimated SARS will trim a full percentage point off China's economic growth this year.\n\nWen's proposals call for greater promotion of exports and use of foreign investment, while providing tax breaks for the hardest-hit industries such as airlines and tourism.\n\nThe plan also stresses the urgency of stabilizing agricultural production amid fear the illness may be spreading to the vast rural areas where most Chinese live.\n\nIn Shanghai, the country's largest city and chief financial center, officials announced the economy grew 12 percent when compared to April 2002.\n\nBut officials warned that the city is likely to see its growth stalled by SARS in the second half of this year, citing a drop in revenues from service industries as well as a slowdown in international trade and foreign investment.",

A total of 179 people have died from SARS there, while almost 900 have been discharged.\n\nIn Toronto, Canada -- which has the largest outbreak outside Asia -- city health officials insist SARS is under control after no new cases were reported Friday.\n\nCanadian health chiefs also rejected a critique of their reporting by an unidentified World Health Organization official, cited in The New York Times.\n\nThe article referred to Health Canada's report Wednesday to the W.H.O. of a possible SARS case in Toronto -- one day after the world health body lifted a travel advisory based on the city's record of containing SARS' spread.\n\n\"All along, we've been open, transparent and consistent with our practices,\" Dr. Colin D'Cunha, Ontario's commissioner of public health, told reporters. \"It certainly frustrates me.\"\n\nD'Cunha said the case -- in a health care worker -- was diagnosed around midnight Monday, but by the time the case was reported to Health Canada it was noon Tuesday and details could not be passed to the W.H.O. in Geneva, Switzerland, which is six hours ahead of Ontario and had closed for the day.\n\nThe Canadian city has had 140 probable cases and 23 SARS deaths.\n\nDoctors at the Chinese University of Hong Kong said two forms of SARS have hit the Chinese territory, which could complicate efforts to develop a diagnosis and vaccine.\n\n\"This rapid evolution is like that of a murderer who is trying to change his fingertips or even his appearance to try to escape detection,\" Dr. Dennis Lo said.\n\nLo added more research is needed to determine whether the virus has become more infectious or deadly.\n\nAlso worrying scientists is at least a dozen cases of SARS relapses among discharged patients.\n\nHong Kong's Health Secretary Dr. Yeoh Eng-kiong admitted in a radio interview on Saturday that authorities did not respond quickly enough to the SARS outbreak, but said it was because little was known about the disease.\n\nNow, recent figures back a declaration from the W.H.O. that the SARS outbreak had peaked in Hong Kong.\n\nBut in mainland China, SARS cases continue to mount.\n\nAnother 181 new cases and 9 more deaths in China were reported on Saturday. Most cases and deaths have been reported in the capital, Beijing, So far around 1,600 people have been infected with SARS and 96 have died from it in China's hardest-hit mainland city to date.\n\nBeijing authorities are hoping isolation may help. They have opened a new 1,000-bed hospital to handle patients with the virus and barricaded some roads as patients were being transferred.\n\nThe Xiaotangshan Hospital threw open its doors after more than 7,000 builders worked feverishly to erect the structure in just eight days.\n\nChina's central government has also reversed its stance and agreed to allow the W.H.O. to send experts to Taiwan to assess the SARS outbreak there.\n\nChina, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province, has blocked efforts by the island to join the United Nations as an independent country. Taiwan has complained that is behind a lack of response from the W.H.O. to its requests for help against SARS.\n\nTaiwan authorities have reported nearly 100 SARS cases. There were five new fatalities Friday.\n\nGlobally, more than 400 have died from SARS, and more than 6,000 people have been infected.",

It also severely damaged the economy.\n\nNo cure or vaccine for SARS is known, forcing authorities to rely on centuries-old measures of isolation, quarantine and travel restrictions to curb the disease.\n\nSince appearing in southern China last November, SARS has infected about 8,400 people and killed about 800 in nearly 30 countries and territories across the world, including Taiwan, China, Canada and Singapore.\n\nAt the height of the epidemic, many Hong Kong residents wore masks on the streets and others simply stayed at home, hitting the retail and restaurant trade hard.\n\nNearly 1,300 people were confined to their homes during the outbreak as authorities fought to stop the disease's spread.\n\nTourists also stopped visiting the territory, slashing a vital source of income and pushing unemployment to a record 8.3 percent.\n\nAnalysts say the epidemic will cost the city billions of dollars in lost business, leaving it teetering on the brink of its third recession in six years.\n\nEven before SARS broke out, Hong Kong was suffering from rising unemployment, chronic deflation and an identity crisis.\n\nThe government had embarked on a massive cleanup campaign amid fears the virus could return.

Researchers say the rhinovirus could jump-start the body\u2019s antiviral defences, providing protection against the flu.\n\nThe findings help answer a mystery surrounding the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, when an expected surge in swine flu cases never materialised in Europe during autumn.\n\nA Yale University team led by Dr Ellen Foxman studied three years of clinical data from more than 13,000 patients seen at Yale New Haven Hospital with symptoms of respiratory infection. They found that even during months when both viruses were active, if the common cold virus was present, the flu virus was not.\n\nDr Foxman, assistant professor of laboratory medicine and immunobiology and senior author of the study, said: \u201cWhen we looked at the data, it became clear that very few people had both viruses at the same time.\u201d\n\nRead more about colds:\n\nNatural remedies: Can honey really help cure a cold?\nA scientist\u2019s guide to life: how to beat a cold\nBut she added that it is not known whether the annual seasonal spread of the common cold virus will have a similar impact on infection rates of those exposed to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\n\nDr Foxman said: \u201cIt is impossible to predict how two viruses will interact without doing the research.\u201d\n\nIn order to test how the rhinovirus and influenza virus interact, the researchers created human airway tissue from stem cells that give rise to epithelial cells, which line the airways of the lung and are a chief target of respiratory viruses. They found that after the tissue had been exposed to rhinovirus, the influenza virus was unable to infect the tissue.\n\nRead more about the flu:\n\nHow are seasonal flu vaccines made?\nWhy don\u2019t viruses like the flu die off when no one is ill?\n\u201cThe antiviral defences were already turned on before the flu virus arrived,\u201d Dr Foxman said.\n\nAccording to the study, published in The Lancet Microbe, the presence of rhinovirus triggered production of the antiviral agent interferon, which is part of the early immune system response to invasion of pathogens.\n\nThe researchers are now looking at whether introduction of the cold virus before infection by the COVID-19 virus offers a similar type of protection.\n\nI\u2019m addicted to the gym, but I have a cold. Can I still exercise?\nA good rule of thumb is the \u2018above-the-neck test\u2019, which says that if your cold symptoms are all in your head \u2013 such as a runny nose, sneezing or a sore throat \u2013 then it\u2019s safe to do some light to moderate exercise.\n\nLast year, health scientists at the University of Bath published a paper arguing that even vigorous exercise is okay, citing evidence that it can boost immune system functioning. Take it slowly, though, and tone down your session if you\u2019re feeling weak or uncomfortable.\n\nAnd if you have below-the-neck symptoms such as a high temperature or chest congestion, it\u2019s best to rest up completely, as exercising will raise your temperature even higher and stress your body, leaving you feeling rotten.",

            "HeadLine": "Coronavirus: Why are we catching more diseases from animals?",
            "Text": "The world is grappling with the new coronavirus, which has spread from China to at least 16 other countries, including the UK.\n\nOutbreaks of new infectious diseases are typically seen as a \"one off\".\n\nBut the new virus - thought to have stemmed from wildlife - highlights our risk from animal-borne disease. This is likely to be more of a problem in future as climate change and globalisation alter the way animals and humans interact.\n\nHow can animals make people ill?\nIn the past 50 years, a host of infectious diseases have spread rapidly after making the evolutionary jump from animals to humans.\n\nThe HIV/Aids crisis of the 1980s originated from great apes, the 2004-07 avian flu pandemic came from birds, and pigs gave us the swine flu pandemic in 2009. More recently, it was discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) came from bats, via civets, while bats also gave us Ebola. Humans have always caught diseases from animals. In fact, most new infectious diseases come from wildlife.\n\nBut environmental change is speeding up this process, while increased city living and international travel mean when these diseases emerge, they can spread more quickly.\n\nCan people recover? And other questions\nCoronavirus: How worried should we be?\nConfirmed coronavirus cases in all China regions\nHow can diseases jump species?\nMost animals carry a range of pathogens - bacteria and viruses that can cause disease.\n\nThe pathogen's evolutionary survival depends on infecting new hosts - and jumping to other species is one way to do this.\n\nThe new host's immune systems try to kill off pathogens, meaning the two are locked in an eternal evolutionary game of trying to find new ways to vanquish each other.\n\nFor example, about 10% of infected people died during the 2003 Sars epidemic, compared with under 0.1% for a \"typical\" flu epidemic. Environmental and climate change are removing and altering animals' habitat, changing how they live, where they live and who eats whom.\n\nThe way humans live has also changed - 55% of the global population now live in cities, up from 35% 50 years ago.\n\nAnd these bigger cities provide new homes for wildlife - rats, mice, raccoons, squirrels, foxes, birds, jackals, monkeys - which can live in the green spaces such as parks and gardens, off the waste humans leave behind.\n\nOften, wildlife species are more successful in cities than in the wild because of the plentiful food supply, making urban spaces a melting pot for evolving diseases. Who is most at risk?\nNew diseases, in a new host, are often more dangerous, which is why any emerging disease is concerning.\n\nSome groups are more vulnerable to catching these diseases than others.\n\nPoorer city-dwellers are more likely to work in cleaning and sanitation, boosting their chances of encountering sources and carriers of disease.\n\nThey may also have weaker immune systems because of poor nutrition and exposure to poor air or unsanitary conditions. And if they fall ill, they may not be able to afford medical care.\n\nNew infections can also spread rapidly in big cities as people are packed so tightly - breathing the same air and touching the same surfaces.\n\nIn some cultures, people also use urban wildlife for food - eating animals caught within the city or bushmeat harvested from the surrounding area.\n\nHow do diseases change our behaviour?\nTo date, almost 8,000 cases of the new coronavirus have been confirmed, with 170 people thought to have died.\n\nWith countries taking steps to stem this outbreak, the potential economic consequences are clear. Travel bans are now in place and, even without them, people are scared of interacting in case they catch the virus, changing their behaviour. It becomes harder to cross borders, seasonal migrant workers can't relocate and supply chains become interrupted.\n\nThis is typical of an outbreak of this nature. In 2003, the Sars epidemic cost the global economy an estimated $40bn (\u00a330.5bn) in six months. This was partly because of the cost of treating people but also dips in economic activity and movement of people.\n\nWhat can we do?\nSocieties and governments tend to treat each new infectious disease as an independent crisis, rather than recognising they are a symptom of how the world is changing.\n\nThe more we change the environment, the more likely we are to disrupt ecosystems and provide opportunities for disease to emerge.\n\nOnly about 10% of the world's pathogens have been documented, so more resources are needed to identify the rest - and which animals are carrying them.\n\nFor example, how many rats are there in London and what diseases do they carry?\n\nMany city-dwellers value urban wildlife but we should also recognise some animals carry potential harms.\n\nIt makes sense to keep track of which animals are newly arriving in cities and whether people are killing or eating wildlife or bringing it to markets from the surrounding area.\n\nImproving sanitation, waste disposal and pest control are ways to help stop these outbreaks emerging and spreading. More widely, it is about changing the way our environments are managed and the way people interact with them. Pandemics are part of our future\nAcknowledging new diseases are emerging and spreading in this way puts us in a stronger position to fight new pandemics, which are an inevitable part of our future.\n\nA century ago, the Spanish flu pandemic infected about half a billion people and killed 50-100 million people worldwide.\n\nScientific advancement and huge investments in global health mean such a disease would be better managed in future.\n\nHowever, the risk remains real and potentially catastrophic - if something similar were to happen again, it would reshape the world.\n\nBy the middle of the last century, some in the West claimed infectious diseases were conquerable.\n\nBut as urbanisation and inequality grow and climate change further disturbs our ecosystems, we must recognise emerging diseases as a growing risk.\n\nAbout this piece\n\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by BBC News from an expert working for an outside organisation.\n\nProf Tim Benton is research director of the Emerging Risks team at Chatham House, where he leads the Energy, Environment and Resources programme.\n\nChatham House, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, describes itself as an independent policy institute helping to build a sustainably secure, prosperous and just world.",

            "Text": "Disease outbreaks can quickly become pandemics in a globalised world. But we have already shown how they can be contained, and beaten.\nO\nOn 31 January 2003, a fishmonger called Zhou Zuofen was admitted into the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital in the Chinese megacity of Guangzhou. He was ill with a peculiar form of pneumonia which had already cropped up in a small number of patients since the previous November.\n\nThis disease is now thought to have first infected a farmer in China\u2019s Foshan county, part of the Guangdong province which borders Hong Kong. It caused flu-like symptoms which included muscle pains, fever, cough, extreme tiredness and a sore throat. The disease then sometimes caused pneumonia, sometimes a secondary form from separate bacterial infection.\n\nZhou\u2019s infection catapulted this obscure disease from a regional curiosity to a cause of international panic. While at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, he is now thought to have passed on the infection to 30 health workers. One of the hospital\u2019s doctors, Liu Jianlun, ended up treating nine patients infected with the disease. From around 15 February 2003, he started showing symptoms of mild illness, but did not connect it to the disease he had been treating. He left the city to attend a family wedding party in nearby Hong Kong. And with that, the mystery ailment was on its first step toward becoming an international emergency.\n\nOn 21 February, the doctor and his wife checked into their room on the ninth floor of Hong\u2019s Metropole Hotel. It was to be a short stay. By the following morning, the doctor knew he was ill enough to need medical attention. He walked the short distance to Kwong Wah Hospital. Knowing he was seriously ill, the 64-year-old doctor requested to be placed in isolation. His foresight had far-reaching consequences. Had he not made this request, things could have been much worse.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nCan you catch Covid-19 twice?\nWhy smart people believe Covid-19 myths\nWhat is Covid-19\u2019s real death rate?\nThe disease Liu had been carrying would go on to be known around the world as Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome). The doctor\u2019s hunch is widely thought to have prevented this new threat from becoming a fully fledged global pandemic. The doctor, however, did not live to see it contained. He died on 5 March, after two weeks fighting the infection in isolation.\n\nThough isolated cases would be reported as late as March 2004, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the emergency over on 5 July 2003, having seen no new cases for 20 days. In the end, Sars would infect more than 8,000 people in 29 countries, killing at least 774 of them \u2013 a fatality rate of just under 10%, far higher than serious seasonal ailments such as flu. Its effect would be most keenly felt in China, Taiwan and Canada. Just like the current Covid-19 pandemic the world is currently fighting, Sars was delivered via airplane. While the Spanish Flu emerged over a century ago, and crawled its way across the globe on passenger steamers and trains that took weeks and months, this infection could arrive on the other side of the world in little more than a day. The potential for disease outbreaks to become pandemics has grown as exponentially as our ability to travel has made the world shrink.\n\nViral infections may be as old as living cells themselves. They have kept pace with human development; occasionally jumping from other species to humans when the conditions are just right. As our populations have increased, and settlements have encroached more and more on the forests their natural hosts inhabit, the threat has risen. Sars, and the frightening haemorrhagic fever Ebola, are 21st Century diseases in a crowded world.\n\nSars began in China, but one of its most serious outbreaks was half a world away in the Canadian city of Toronto, in the province of Ontario. Jacalyn Duffin, a Canadian medical historian and haematologist, was working near Toronto when the outbreak first happened. \u201cBeing a historian who is also interested in disease, I was paying attention from the get go,\u201d she says.\n\nSars was so communicable that it was vital for those who were ill to be properly tracked\nSars arrived in Canada with an elderly Toronto resident, Kwan Sui-Chu, who had been visiting Hong Kong; she had been staying at the Metropole Hotel. She fell ill and died at home, but not before she fatally infected her son, who passed the disease on to a cluster of other people before he died at the Scarborough Grace Hospital.\n\nOntario\u2019s health services were soon on a war footing. \u201cEvery hospital in Ontario had to implement strict quarantine,\u201d says Duffin. \u201cTo get into work you had to line up outside and get your temperature taken.\u201d\n\nSars was so communicable that it was vital for those who were ill to be properly tracked. Duffin says hospital workers were given new photo IDs that included a barcode, so that they could be tracked when they moved from one zone to another. \u201cIt was amazing to me how quickly that came into being,\u201d she says.\n\nTracking patients is one of the three most important weapons that health agencies have when it comes to dealing with pandemics. The trinity is tracking, isolation, treatment. We have already seen some Asian countries, such as Singapore and South Korea, seemingly flatten the curve of coronavirus transmission by rigorous tracking of the infected. These are lessons learned during the Sars outbreak. In the end, Sars infected some 400 people in Canada, and killed 44. Had the Canadian health authorities not dealt swiftly with the outbreak, it may have killed many more.\n\nIsolation has another, more medical, term \u2013 quarantine. The word comes from the medieval Venetian word \u201cquarantena\u201d, referring to the 40 days Christ spent in the wilderness according to the Bible. Long before science confirmed that viruses and bacteria cause disease, quarantining was a very effective weapon in the fight against plagues.\n\n\u201cIn Milan, during the great plague, they closed the gates,\u201d Duffin says. \u201cIf there was plague in a house they blocked you in and they wouldn\u2019t allow you out until you recovered \u2013 or died. And because of that, Milan had a much lower incidence of deaths than the rest of Italy.\n\n\u201cI got a phone call in the middle of the epidemic because the mayor of Toronto at the time was upset because they were naming Toronto in a travel advisory, and recommending people didn\u2019t go there.\n\n\u201cHere I was, a historian just sitting in her office minding her own business. And Ian Gemmill [Canada\u2019s Medical Officer of Health at the time] asked me , \u2018Has quarantining ever worked?\u2019 He asked me that question. I said, \u2018It works.\u2019 He then asked me, \u2018I need to know how many lives it\u2019s saved.\u2019 And I said, \u2018They don\u2019t count the people who never get sick.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere was one aspect of Sars which helped humanity fight it \u2013 Sars was a novel virus to the human immune system. When the human body encountered it, the immune system went into overdrive to fight it because it didn\u2019t yet have antibodies. This meant that those who were infected by it very quickly became ill as a result of this over-reactive response, also known as a cytokine storm. This limited the number of people who could be infected by people with the disease. Duffin says: \u201cYou had the signs of Sars, and you either died or you very quickly got better.\n\nThough the structures are still in place, they\u2019re not as robust as they were before \u2013 Jacalyn Duffin\n\u201cIt\u2019s strange how long these people [the Covid-19 patients] who have gone into intensive care stay there.\u201d Covid-19 has a relatively long incubation period \u2013 several days and up to two weeks in some cases \u2013 and it can take weeks before even seriously ill patients recover or succumb to the virus.\n\nThere was another far-reaching effect of the Sars virus, at least in Canada. \u201cUp until then, Canada didn\u2019t have a national public health agency,\u201d says Duffin. While there had been pandemic planning before, it had been at a provincial level. \u201cSars was almost like a dummy run.\u201d\n\nDuffin was bought into pandemic planning once Canada\u2019s new federal public health agency was formed in 2004. Pandemic planning was regularly practised in the years immediately after the Sars outbreak. In recent years, however, the planning had become more sporadic due to budget cuts and the memory of the 2003 crisis fading.\n\n\u201cSars was a long time ago,\u201d Duffin says. \u201cThe younger people [at the agency] didn\u2019t know about it so much. Though the structures are still in place, they\u2019re not as robust as they were before.\u201d\n\nYet, Sars did lead to a lot of the pandemic procedures we have seen swinging into action in the last four months being put in place. But it is far from the only serious disease outbreak to have taken place recently. In 2009, the Swine Flu Pandemic is thought to have killed more than 250,000 people as it swept around the world, infecting up to 1.4bn people \u2013 more than were infected by the Spanish Flu. In 2016 WHO declared an emergency over the Zika fever as it spread across South and Central America, Asia and the tropical Pacific. While the virus produced only a mild fever in adults, it could cause severe birth defects if pregnant women contracted it.\n\nBut by far the most serious outbreak, at least in terms of the damage it could have caused in the developing world, was the 2013/14 outbreak of Ebola in West Africa.\n\nEbola is a gruesome pathogen. A haemorrhagic fever, it can cause severe internal bleeding \u2013 in the worst cases, people bleed from their eyes, nose and other orifices as their organs shut down. The first identifiable cases amongst humans were reported in 1976, during an outbreak in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo, or DRC). The outbreak took place in the village of Yambuku, in the north of the country, near the Ebola River, from where this new disease took its name.\n\nPresumed to have jumped from the wild to humans via the bushmeat trade, Ebola is thought to be carried by bats. The Zairean government quarantined the region amid rising panic and the outbreak was relatively quickly contained, but the fatality rate was shockingly high. Of the 318 people confirmed to have been infected, 280 died. That is a fatality rate of 88%.\n\nThe way we had dealt with these communities had been very top down, it was a case of, \u2018We have the expertise you need\u2019 \u2013 Gwendolen Eamer\nOver the next few decades, sporadic outbreaks occurred mostly in southern Africa, mostly in the DRC and neighbouring Uganda. Each time hundreds of cases were reported. The worst fatality rate, during an outbreak in the DRC in 2003, was 90%.\n\nThe worst outbreak so far, however, came in 2013 and 2014. Instead of the vast jungle-covered interiors of the DRC, this took place in the far more crowded countries of West Africa. The outbreak was traced to a one-year-old child who developed the infection and died in Guinea. From Guinea, it spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone, becoming global news as it did so.\n\nGwendolen Eamer worked for the International Federation of the Red Cross both in Guinea and Sierra Leone during the outbreak, which ended up killing more than 11,000 people. But the information gleaned from those sporadic outbreaks was vital. \u201cA lot was learned about how you treat people, that it was crucial there was the availability of supportive care, there was hydration to stop them losing fluids.\u201d Eamer says the supportive care and the vaccines developed since to protect against Ebola have helped blunt its effects \u201cbut they are not a silver bullet\u201d.\n\nShe says groups likes the Red Cross had to learn a new way of working. \u201cThe way we had dealt with these communities had been very top down,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a case of \u2018we have the expertise you need\u2019.\u201d\n\nEamer says the clinical and medical insight was often not reassuring the people affected by the outbreak. \u201cFor most people that kind of information doesn\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019s more, \u2018what do I have to do to change my behaviour? How do I help myself and my children?\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou need to be connecting from within the community.\u201d\n\nWestern clinical medicine also sometimes butted heads with local custom\nEamer says the Ebola outbreak showed the importance of the holy trinity of pandemic prevention \u2013 detection, isolation and treatment. Most crucial of all, in the densely populated settlements in West Africa, was extensive contact tracing.\n\n\u201cIt did very well in tackling Ebola,\u201d she says. \u201cWe did double ring tracing, which is everyone you came in contact with and everyone they came in contact with.\u201d This technique doesn\u2019t necessarily require expensive technology, but it does require many, many hours of interviewing and follow up. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018operationally heavy\u2019 but it does work,\u201d adds Eamer.\n\nWestern clinical medicine also sometimes butted heads with local custom, and Eamer says the agencies had to learn how to be flexible around these. One such case has been burial of Ebola victims. Given that bodies could still possibly transmit the disease, they had to be completely zipped up in body bags to avoid contamination. But local custom calls for the face to be visible at burial, otherwise the soul will not be able to leave the body. In some places, it was also custom for grieving family members to touch the face of their dead relative.  \u201cIf your child has died, that ability for your child\u2019s soul to get into Heaven is really important for you as a parent,\u201d says Eamer. After talking with local leaders, they found a solution \u2013 a hole in the body bags around the face , in keeping with the traditional practices. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t perfect but it was good enough,\u201d says Eamer. \u201cIt\u2019s about listening, we\u2019re told what really doesn\u2019t work for them and how we can adapt around that.\u201d\n\nGood support from local communities has effects long after the outbreak dies down. Health agencies have found local infrastructure \u2013 traditional healers, community leaders, farmers and health workers \u2013 are an incredibly powerful tool in making sure local outbreaks don\u2019t become epidemics.\n\n\u201cCommunities know what\u2019s normal for them,\u201d she says. One risk factor that often forewarns possible outbreaks of diseases like anthrax is mass animal die-offs. \u201cIf you\u2019re from a Masai community, you know it\u2019s not normal for five cows to die in 24 hours.\u201d\n\nThat community early warning system really works: it caught the first case of Covid-19 in Somaliland a few weeks ago.\n\nAlexander Kumar, a global health medical doctor based at King\u2019s College in London, also saw the Ebola outbreak at close hand. He worked at a treatment clinic in Sierra Leone during the outbreak, and saw patients die in front of him.\n\n\u201cAn expert in Ebola 10 years ago was someone who had seen maybe five or 10 cases,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not calling myself an expert, but in West Africa, I was seeing hundreds of cases a week.\u201d\n\nWorking in PPE during that Ebola crisis, you realise it takes away that human touch side of medicine \u2013 Alexander Kumar\nOne of Kumar\u2019s own lessons was that on the ground, the disease rarely caused the most serious symptom: blood loss. \u201cThese people weren\u2019t bleeding from their eyes or nose, the symptoms were more like vomiting and diarrhoea. But the death rates were the same.\u201d\n\nWorking in personal protective equipment or PPE was vital to keep medical staff from contracting the disease themselves. But in the sweltering tropical climate this cumbersome garb made doing their job even harder. It also had an enormous psychological effect on those trying to give end of life care to dying patients.\n\n\u201cWorking in PPE during that Ebola crisis, you realise it takes away that human touch side of medicine,\u201d says Kumar. \u201cAs a medical student you\u2019re taught to put your hand on a patient\u2019s body when you\u2019re talking to them. You can\u2019t  do that the same way when you\u2019re wearing PPE.\u201d That same struggle is being beamed into our living rooms every day, as we see footage of nurses and clinicians in PPE trying to keep Covid-19 patients alive, covered in protective gear which makes it all the more difficult to make human connection.\n\nKumar says the Ebola outbreak could easily have been much worse, but what worked was \u201cpolitical will, media attention and innovation and research, which came up with vaccines and treatment. If Ebola erupts again, we will be able to squash it.\u201d\n\nEvery pandemic is a classroom; each outbreak teaches a new lesson. The current coronavirus pandemic is the first chance for health agencies to study how whole countries adapt to extended isolation.\n\n\u201cI spent nine months in isolation in Antarctica, and it\u2019s both one of the best and one of the worst things you can do,\u201d Kumar says.\n\nAfter the initial coronavirus outbreak is contained, the new challenge may be dealing with the after-effects of isolation, which will continue long after the pandemic claims its last victim.",

The ministry has to now send specialists to determine if it is indeed a SARS case,\" an official of the Guangdong provincial health bureau said on Saturday.\n\nThe health ministry confirmed to AFP that it had received the report and had sent a team to Guangdong.\n\n\"On Friday, an expert panel was sent to Guangdong province to investigate the case,\" said an official.\n\nWith 5327 cases and 349 deaths, China was the country most affected by the SARS epidemic which peaked earlier this year after first emerging in Guangdong province, which borders Hong Kong, in late 2002.\n\nGuangzhou daily Nanfang Dushi Bao, which first reported the latest suspected case, gave the patient's surname as Luo and said he was hospitalised on December 20.\n\nHong Kong's director of health Dr P.Y. Lam said the territory's health authorities had been told of the suspected case on Friday evening and that the man was a freelance television station worker who was not believed to have travelled recently to Hong Kong or elsewhere in China.\n\nLam said he had been told the patient had typical SARS symptoms, including a respiratory tract infection and fever. \"We will deploy staff to check people travelling from Guangdong on a random basis,\" Lam told a briefing.\n\nHe said this would be on top of current measures, which include thermal imaging of travellers to check their temperatures and requiring them to fill in health declarations.\n\nHong Kong hard hit\n\nHong Kong was the second worst hit region after mainland China in the global SARS outbreak earlier this year, with 299 patients dying out of a total of 1800 infections.\n\nChinese state television said the man was in a stable condition. Another daily, Xin Jing Bao, said provincial health authorities were not authorised to confirm SARS cases, under current Chinese procedures.\nIt said the Guangdong health office had called an emergency meeting on Friday. The daily quoted a hospital worker as saying preventive measures had been taken. \"A noticeable change is that hospital patients must wear masks,\" the worker was quoted as saying.\n\nGuangdong province has prepared stern measures to prevent the virus from spreading if it reappears, state media said on Thursday.\n\nPublic transport checks\n\nThroughout next month's Chinese New Year holiday - when millions go travelling - officials at the train station in the provincial capital of Guangzhou will check all passengers' temperatures, the Yangcheng Evening News had reported.\n\nThose with body temperatures of 38 degrees Celsius or more will be prevented from boarding and instead be sent directly to hospital for treatment, the paper said. Passengers who have a temperature of at least 37.5 degrees Celsius, and who cough and have difficulty breathing, will also be pulled off trains for observation, according to the report.\nSARS emerged in Guangzhou some time late last year and eventually spread to most corners of China as well as other parts of Asia and the world. The first case appeared at Foshan, about 20 km from Guangzhou.\n\nIt later spread to Hong Kong and then dozens of countries around the world.\n\nTaiwan had a scare earlier this month when a military hospital researcher was believed to have caught the SARS virus while at work.\n\nHe was confirmed as a SARS victim on December 17, but health authorities declared on Friday that the island had been cleared of the infection after the last people who had contact with the patient were removed from a watchlist.",

The virus, which has no known cure, has killed more than 270 people and infected around 4,800 worldwide after being carried to over 20 countries by air travellers since it emerged in southern China late last year.\n\nAsian ministers discussed the introduction of strict pre-travel checks on passengers at airports and seaports in a bid to stop the virus from spreading. \"The threat posed by SARS is unprecedented.

It has battered Asian economies, forcing governments to cut growth forecasts, and hit business across all sectors from retail to airlines to tourism.\n\nIn Canada, the country with most fatalities outside Asia, authorities reported three more deaths in Toronto and eight new cases among health care workers, bringing the death toll to 19. \"We're not entirely out of the woods on everything, but we're moving along day by day,\" Dr. Jim Young, Ontario's commissioner of public safety, told a news conference.\n\nCanadian 'export'\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, criticised for going on holiday to the Caribbean at the height of the crisis, said the WHO was wrong to warn against non-essential travel to Toronto, the epicentre of SARS in Canada.\n\nWHO justified the warning against Toronto because the country was exporting the virus. The Philippines confirmed on Friday a nursing assistant and her father died of SARS this month after the daughter returned from Toronto.\n\nA respiratory infection with a mortality rate of about six percent, SARS spreads via coughs and sneezes but can also be transmitted by touching contaminated objects. The disease has caused widespread alarm in mainland China with 122 deaths and in Hong Kong, which has reported 115 deaths.\n\nWHO and other groups have accused China of concealing the severity of the outbreak, robbing them of the opportunity to investigate it early and prevent it spreading across China and to other countries. China responded by sacking the health minister and the mayor of Beijing for negligence.\n\n\nIn India, a 40-year-old man tested positive for SARS, authorities said, the country's fifth case. Some doctors have expressed fears SARS could spread rapidly in India due to its congested cities and overstretched health system. But government officials have played down the risks.\n\nSingapore said on Saturday a 63-ear-old man had died of SARS, bringing its death toll to 18. The city-state also reported its youngest victim yet, an 18-month-old girl.\n\nThe city-state has implemented some of the world's harshest measures to deal with the illness, quarantining nearly 2,800 people and threatening them with fines US$5,600 or six months in jail if they leave their homes.\n\n\"Let's take this thing seriously. If you don't behave you are imperilling your neighbours, yourself, your country and the economy,\" said Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's senior minister and founder of the nation's long-ruling People's Action Party.\n\nLee said his wife had been  quarantined after being  treated in hospital  next to  a\n\npatient who was later diagnosed with SARS and had since died.\n\nTaiwan moved about 480 health workers to a military barracks after  their hospital  was sealed due to the discovery of SARS, officials said.

But the region has stepped up precautions to ward off the disease by increasing screening measures for  passengers arriving or leaving to affected countries and implementing WHO recommendations.\n\nAffected countries according to the international health body include Canada, Singapore, China and Mongolia. The WHO called on travellers from these places to be screened at the point of departure.\n\nHallaj said passengers from these areas across the region were examined by medical authorities at airports and warned against panic.\n\n\u201c\n\nThere are more than 200 diseases with (symptoms of) fever and cough\u2026we don\u2019t want people to panic for no reason,\u201d he said.\n\nKuwait is the only Middle Eastern country which the WHO reported had a probable SARS case.

            "HeadLine": "Guidance for K-12 School Administrators on the Use of Masks in Schools",
            "Text": "CDC suggests that all school reopening plans address adherence to behaviors that prevent the spread of COVID-19. When used consistently and correctly, along with important mitigation strategies, masks are important to help slow the spread of COVID-19. Other important mitigation strategies include social distancing, washing hands, and regular cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces in schools and buses. CDC provides considerations for wearing masks and recommends that people wear masks in public settings and when around people who live outside of their household. The use of masks is especially important when social distancing is difficult to maintain.\n\nMasks are recommended as a simple barrier to help prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air and onto other people when the person wearing the mask coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice. Masks are an example of source control. Several studies1-13 have documented asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission; meaning that people with COVID-19 who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) and those who are not yet showing symptoms (pre-symptomatic) can still transmit the virus to other people. Masks are meant to protect other people in case the wearer is unknowingly infected. Masks are not personal protective equipment, such as surgical masks or respirators. \n\nThe use of masks in educational settings may present challenges, particularly for younger students and students with special healthcare or educational needs. This document provides guidance to help school administrators decide how to best implement the wearing of masks \u2015 in their school settings and facilities, including but not limited to buses and other shared transportation. \n\nEducation and promotion of positive and supportive relationships should remain the primary focus of school administrators, teachers, and staff. This guidance provides K-12 school administrators with strategies to encourage students to wear masks, consistent with CDC guidance, while maintaining a positive learning environment. \n\nGeneral Considerations\nCOVID-19 can be spread to others even if you do not feel sick. A mask helps prevent a person who is sick from spreading the virus to others. Appropriate and consistent use of masks is most important when students, teachers, and staff are indoors and when social distancing of at least 6 feet is difficult to implement or maintain.\n\nMasks should not be placed on:\n\nChildren younger than 2 years old.\nAnyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious.\nAnyone who is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.\nAppropriate and consistent use of masks may be challenging for some students, teachers, and staff, including:\n\nYounger students, such as those in early elementary school.\nStudents, teachers, and staff with severe asthma or other breathing difficulties.\nStudents, teachers, and staff with special educational or healthcare needs, including intellectual and developmental disabilities, mental health conditions, and sensory concerns or tactile sensitivity.\nWhile masks are strongly encouraged to reduce the spread of COVID-19, CDC recognizes there are specific instances when wearing a mask may not be feasible. In these instances, parents, guardians, caregivers, teachers, and school administrators should consider adaptations and alternatives whenever possible. They may need to consult with healthcare providers for advice about wearing masks.\n\nConsider use of clear masks that cover the nose and wrap securely around the face by some teachers and staff. Clear masks should be determined not to cause any breathing difficulties or over heating for the wearer. Teachers and staff who may consider using clear masks include:\n\nThose who interact with students or staff who are deaf or hard of hearing, per the Individuals with Disabilities Education Actexternal icon\nTeachers of young students learning to read\nTeachers of students in English as a second language classes\nTeachers of students with disabilities\nClear masks are not face shields. CDC does not recommend use of face shields for normal everyday activities or as a substitute for masks because of a lack of evidence of their effectiveness for source control.\n\nUnintended Consequences\nStigma, discrimination, or bullying may arise due to wearing or not wearing a mask. Schools should have a plan to prevent and address harmful or inappropriate behavior.\nNot all families will agree with school policies about masks. Schools should have a plan to address challenges that may arise and refer parents, caregivers, and guardians to CDC\u2019s guidance on masks.\nPractical Recommendations\nInclude masks on school supply lists and provide masks as needed to students, teachers, staff, or visitors who do not have them available.\nInclude clear masks on school supply lists for teachers and staff who regularly interact with students who are deaf or hard of hearing, students learning to read, students with disabilities, and those who rely on lip reading as a part of learning, such as students who are English Language Learners.\nEnsure that students and staff are aware of the correct use of masks, including wearing masks over the nose and mouth and securely around the face.\nEnsure that students, teachers and staff are aware that they should wash or sanitize their hands (using a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol) before putting on a mask.\nEnsure that students, teachers, and staff are aware that they should not touch their masks while wearing them and, if they do, they should wash their hands before and after with soap and water or sanitize hands (using a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol).\nEnsure teachers and staff are aware that they should wash or sanitize hands (using a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol) before and after helping a student put on or adjust a mask.\nEnsure that all students and staff are aware that masks should not be worn if they are wet. A wet mask may make it difficult to breathe.\nEnsure that all students and staff are aware that they should never share or swap masks.\nStudents\u2019 masks should be clearly identified with their names or initials, to avoid confusion or swapping. Students\u2019 masks may also be labeled to indicate top/bottom and front/back.\nMasks should be stored in a space designated for each student that is separate from others when not being worn (e.g., in individually labeled containers or bags, personal lockers, or cubbies).\nMasks should be washed after every day of use and/or before being used again, or if visibly soiled.\nStudents and schools should consider having additional masks available for students, teachers, and staff in case a back-up mask is needed during the day and to facilitate every day washing of masks.\nAdditional Considerations for the Use of Masks among K-12 Students\nCDC recommends that people, including teachers, staff, and students, wear masks in public settings as able when around people who live outside of their household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.\n\nThe following table contains examples of some, but not all, situations schools might encounter.\n\nMasks in schoolspdf icon\n\nAdditional Considerations for the Use of Masks among K-12 Students\nPossible Student Scenario\tMasks recommended\tMasks may be considered\tAdditional considerations\nStudents are seated less than 6 feet apart while riding a bus or carpooling\tcheck solid icon\t\t\nMasks should always be worn by bus and carpool drivers as able*\nStudents are less than 6 feet apart while entering or exiting school (e.g., carpool drop off/pick up) or while transitioning to/from other activities\tcheck solid icon\t\t\nConsider having staff monitor students during transitions to encourage correct use and distribute masks as needed.\nTeachers and staff should wash or sanitize hands (using a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol) before and after helping a student put on or adjust a mask.\nStudents are seated at least 6 feet apart in the classroom\t\tcheck solid icon\t\nAdaptations and alternatives should be considered whenever possible to increase the feasibility of wearing a mask or to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading.\nStudents are seated less than 6 feet apart in the classroom, or are engaging in learning stations or circle time that require close contact\tcheck solid icon\t\t\nSchools may consider keeping students in \u201ccohorts.\u201d Cohorts are groups of students that do not mix with other cohorts/groups of students throughout the school day.\nAdaptations and alternatives should be considered whenever possible to increase the feasibility of wearing a mask or to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading.\nStudents are less than 6 feet apart while transitioning between classes or to other activities during the school day\tcheck solid icon\t\t\nSchools may consider staggering classroom transition times and allow only one-way pathways/hallways.\nAdaptations and alternatives should be considered whenever possible to increase the feasibility of wearing a mask or to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading.\nStudents are at recess or in physical education class.\t\tcheck solid icon\t\nVigorous exercise in a confined space (e.g., indoors) may contribute to transmission of COVID-19 and should be limited.\nSocial distancing helps protect students at recess or in physical education class.\nConsider conducting activities in an area with greater ventilation or air exchange (e.g., outdoors).\nSee CDC\u2019s guidance on youth sports for more information.\nAdaptations and alternatives should be considered whenever possible to increase the feasibility of wearing a mask or to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading.\nStudents are in band, choir, or music class.\t\tcheck solid icon\t\nWhen students are not singing or playing an instrument that requires the use of their mouth, they should wear a mask in music class (unless class is outdoors and distance can be maintained).\nSocial distancing helps protect students in music class.\nWhile students are singing or playing an instrument, use visual cues to keep them at least 6 feet apart.

If parents, caregivers, and guardians model appropriate use of masks and help students get used to wearing them, students may be more comfortable using them.\nIntroduce students with sensory concerns/tactile sensitivities to masks with a variety of materials, prints, and textures, and allow them to choose which mask is most comfortable.\nUse behavioral techniques such as positive reinforcement to increase the likelihood that students will comply with mask guidance and other prevention practices.\nEncourage parents, caregivers, and guardians to include students in the selection of their mask and/or the material that is used to make it. This might increase a child\u2019s acceptance of wearing the mask.\nDisplay age appropriate posters and materials with visual cues that show the proper way to wear a mask in classrooms and hallways. Consider incorporating images of popular influencers promoting or modeling use of masks.\nInclude reminders about masks in daily announcements, school newspapers, and other materials.  All communication should be in an appropriate format, literacy level, and language. Consider including how to properly use, take off, and wash masks in back-to-school communications educational materials. \nElementary School Settings\nEnsure that teachers and school staff are available to help students put on and adjust masks as needed and that teachers and staff wash or sanitize their hands with hand sanitizer that includes at least 60% alcohol before and after doing so.\nPlay games or engage in other fun activities that teach students how to wear a mask.\nConsider using some art materials or other creative outlets to help students understand why masks help reduce the spread of COVID-19.\nShare social stories about masks with students so they know what to expect at school. A social story is similar to a simple picture book that teaches students what to expect in social settings.\nUse behavioral techniques, such as positive reinforcement, to increase the likelihood that students will comply with mask guidance. \nMiddle School Settings\nShow short videos or incorporate short lessons (less than 10 minutes) that teach students how to wear a mask. Consider including videos with celebrities, musicians, athletes or other influencers popular among this age group.\nFollow videos with verbal instructions that demonstrate the correct ways to wear a mask.\nEngage the class in discussions about why masks help reduce the spread of COVID-19.\nIncorporate a lesson into the science curriculum on how respiratory droplets spread infectious disease.\nCreate a school competition for the best health communication strategy to highlight the importance of wearing a mask to middle school students.\nHigh School Settings\nShow videos or incorporate lessons that teach students how to wear a mask, including the correct and incorrect ways to wear a mask. Consider including videos with celebrities, musicians, athletes, or other influencers popular among this age group.\nAsk students to write a short paper on the science behind the use of masks as a form of source control.\nCreate a school competition for the best health communication strategy to highlight the importance of wearing masks to high school students.\nStudents with Special Healthcare Needs\nAsk parents, caregivers, and guardians to practice wearing masks at home before the student returns to school.\nShare social stories about masks with students so they know what to expect at school. A social story is similar to a simple picture book that teaches students about what to expect in social settings.\nIntroduce students with sensory concerns or tactile sensitivities to masks with a variety of materials, prints, and textures, and allow them to choose which mask is most comfortable.\nUse behavioral techniques such as positive reinforcement to increase the likelihood that students will comply with mask guidance and other prevention practices.",

            "Text": "COVID-19 can affect anyone, and the disease can cause symptoms ranging from mild to very severe.  For some other illnesses caused by respiratory viruses (such as influenza), some people may be more likely to have severe illness than others because they have characteristics or medical conditions that increase their risk. These are commonly called \u201crisk factors.\u201d  Examples include older age or having certain underlying medical conditions.\n\nCDC is conducting disease surveillance and field investigations to better understand why some people are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 illness. This is one of the top priorities in CDC\u2019s strategy to combat COVID-19. What we learn from these efforts will provide vital information to help CDC scientists and other public health officials make decisions to protect our most vulnerable populations.\n\nCDC carries out these activities in collaboration with state, local, and territorial health departments; public health, commercial, and clinical laboratories; vital statistics offices; health care providers; emergency departments; and academic and private sector partners.\n\nWhy Risk Factors Matter\nPeople with risk factors may be more likely to need hospitalization or intensive care if they have COVID-19, or they may be more likely to die of the infection.\n\nIt is important to learn about risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness because it can help you:\n\nTake precautions as you go about your daily life and attend events.\nBetter understand how a medical condition could affect your own health if you get sick with COVID-19.\nAnticipate medical treatment that you might need if you get sick.\nReduce your risk for severe COVID-19 illness by managing any conditions you have that are risk factors.\nHow We Learn about Risk Factors for Severe Disease\nBecause COVID-19 is a new disease, more work is needed to better understand the risk factors for severe illness or complications. Potential risk factors that have been identified to date include:\n\nAge\nRace/ethnicity\nGender\nSome medical conditions\nUse of certain medications\nPoverty and crowding\nCertain occupations\nPregnancy\nAdditional research will help us confirm if these are risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness and determine if there are other factors that increase a person\u2019s risk.\n\nInvestigations\nCDC is working to identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness through a variety of investigations, some of which are described below.  These investigations include adults and children and examine severe illness resulting in hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions.

            "Text": "(CNN)Early stage clinical trial results show the Covid-19 vaccine candidate made by Novavax is safe and elicits an immune response, according to a study published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine. The results had previously been announced by the company in early August. Using a randomized, placebo-controlled trial -- the gold-standard method of study -- scientists gave the vaccine or a placebo, an inert substance like saline, to 131 healthy adults in May. Eighty-three people got the vaccine with adjuvant, an agent to boost the body's immune response. Another 25 got the vaccine without the booster and 23 got the placebo. Participants also received a second injection 21 days after the first.\nThe volunteers came from two locations in Australia and they were all under the age of 60. People who had Covid-19 or who had recovered from Covid-19 were excluded from the trial.\nIn a phase Phase 1 trial, doctors mostly watch to see if the vaccine is safe, but they also check to see if it produced a response. For 35 days, participants were told to record any potential symptoms or soreness. Volunteers were also given a swab test for Covid-19 if they had any symptoms, and were tested 35 days after their first injection.\nAt day 35, there were no serious or unusual adverse events. One person reported a mild fever that lasted for a day after the second shot. Otherwise, most didn't have any reaction at all, or if they did have a reaction, it was mild. Two people in two of the vaccine groups had headache, fatigue and malaise for a median of two days or less. Two people from two of the vaccine groups had fatigue, malaise, and tenderness.\nAfter the second vaccination, most people didn't have any problems, or they were mild. One person had tenderness after the second shot and eight had joint pain and fatigue. The vaccine seemed to generate an immune response. All the volunteers who got the vaccine developed neutralizing antibodies after the second dose.\nAt day 35, participants who got two doses of the vaccine with the adjuvant developed neutralizing antibodies at levels more than four to six times greater than average than the antibodies developed by people who had recovered from Covid-19. Antibodies are the proteins the body naturally produces to fight off an infection or toxin.\nThe vaccine also seemed to generate T-cells, the type of immune cells that also help protect the body from infection, in the 16 volunteers who were randomly selected and tested for T-cell response. The benefit of adding adjuvant to the vaccine was clear, based on the antibody response it generated, the study found. It also showed the value of the second dose on day 21.\n\"Based on the positive Phase 1 results, we have begun multiple Phase 2 clinical trials, from which we expect to collect preliminary efficacy,\" said Dr. Gregory Glenn, president of research and development at Novavax. \"Novavax is committed to generating the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data that will support confident usage of the vaccine, both in the US and globally, and the data published today further bolsters our conviction that this is possible.\"\nThere are limits to what this trial can determine about the vaccine. It's a small number of patients and there were few Black and Latinx volunteers in the trial. The patients were also in good health. Dr. Paul Offit, Director of the Vaccine Education Center and professor of pediatrics at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said the results look good for this early stage.\n\"It will need to be tested in tens of thousands of people to see not just their response, but if you can prove that it is protective,\" Offit said. \"So we wait months to see if that happens.\"\nOffit noted that, compared to some of the other candidates among the 33 Covid-19 vaccines in various stages of development right now, this one may have an advantage, because it uses an approach that has been successfully tried with other vaccines, like those that protect against shingles. \"I think my takeaway from this is this is a tried and true vaccine strategy,\" Offit said. \"But we will have to wait and see if they prove it works.\"\nFive vaccines are in clinical trials in the US, and 33 around the world, according to the World Health Organization.",

            "Text": "(CNN)The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has told public health officials around the United States to prepare to distribute a potential coronavirus vaccine as soon as late October. It also provided planning scenarios to help states prepare.\n\nThe documents were posted by The New York Times and the CDC confirmed to CNN it has sent them to city and state public health officials. The scenarios offer details about distribution for two Covid-19 vaccines when supplies \"may be constrained.\"\nThey've also advised the states on who should get vaccinated first -- healthcare professionals, essential workers, national security \"populations\" and long-term care facility residents and staff.\n\"These scenarios are designed to support jurisdictional , federal, and partner planning, but they are still considered hypothetical,\" one document reads.\nThe scenario documents do not necessarily mean a vaccine will be available by late October. Pandemic planning exercises have for years included recommendations that the federal government ready a distribution network while scientists work on a vaccine. The Trump administration has said it's doing this. Companies developing the vaccines are already ramping up manufacturing so that, in case one or more is found safe and effective in people, it could start going into arms immediately. CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said it's simple preparedness.\n\"Right now I will say we're preparing earnestly for what I anticipate will be reality ... that there'll be one or more vaccines available for us in November, December -- and we have to figure out how to make sure they're distributed in a fair and equitable way across the country,\" Redfield said during an interview with Yahoo Finance.\nCNN reported last week that Redfield had asked states to speed through permits for medical and pharmaceutical supplies company McKesson to help distribute any eventual coronavirus vaccine. In a letter, Redfield asked them to waive any requirements that might get in the way of distributing vaccines by November 1 -- before Election Day -- and weeks, if not months, before most experts expect any vaccine to be fully tested. The director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Francis Collins, said he doesn't read this as CDC preparing to jump the gun on a vaccine. He said it's just in case one of the vaccines now being tested shows fast, clear evidence it is protecting people.\n\"Now, keep in mind that the likelihood of that is pretty low,\" Collins told CNN. \"This is like the Boy Scout motto, 'Be Prepared,'\" he said. \"Even if it's very low likelihood, if everything happened to come together really beautifully and we had an answer by then and we knew we had a vaccine that was safe and effective, wouldn't you want people to be ready to figure out how to do the distribution? That's all that CDC is saying.\"\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he is confident there will be a vaccine for Covid-19 by the end of the year. \"I believe that by the time we get to the end of this calendar year, that we will feel comfortable that we do have a safe and effective vaccine,\" Fauci said on NBC's \"The COVID-19 vaccine landscape is evolving and uncertain, and these scenarios may evolve as more information is available,\" one of the scenario documents advises.\nMembers of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, including US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn, have said recently it's possible the FDA could authorize an experimental Covid-19 vaccine before large Phase 3 trials are complete, if data shows a vaccine was safe and effective.\nThree vaccines are currently in Phase 3 trials in the United States: those developed by Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; Pfizer and BioNTech; and AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford.",

            "Text": "(CNN)Another 134,000 people could die in the US from Covid-19 by December if no further safety measures are mandated -- and the actual number probably would be much worse if mandates are relaxed, researchers say.\n\nThe projection by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation comes with a silver lining: About 70,000 of those lives would be saved if many more Americans wore masks, the institute's leader said.\n\"It really depends on what our leaders do, (both) as individuals, and what governments do,\" the IHME's chief, Dr. Chris Murray, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Friday night. At least 176,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the US since the pandemic began, and more than 5.6 million have been infected, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\nIHME projected that if nothing about the nation's approach to prevention changed, death rates would dip in September but rise later in the fall, and the total would reach about 310,000 by December 1.\nBut changes in behavior would affect the projection, he said:\n\u2022 If governments ease current social distancing restrictions and mask mandates, daily death rates could reach 6,000 daily by December, up from his current prediction of 2,000 daily, Murray said.\n\u2022 On the other hand, if significantly more people wore masks, the projection of total deaths from now to December would drop by almost 70,000, he said. About 95% of the US population would have to wear masks for that to happen, he said.\nCoronavirus case rates have been dropping for weeks in parts of the US, but death rates have been relatively elevated.\nThe country's seven-day average for daily coronavirus deaths was 987 on Friday -- the first time in more than three weeks that it dipped below 1,000, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\nDaily US cases over the past week averaged about 44,100 as of Friday, down from a peak average of 67,317 on July 22, John Hopkins data show.\nUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield said earlier this week he expects deaths to begin declining by next week as a result of continued mitigation measures.\nPreventing another wave\nThe CDC director expressed concern that while parts of the country are reporting improvement in new cases, states in middle America like Nebraska and Oklahoma seem to be \"stuck\" and cases aren't falling.\n\"We don't need to have a third wave in the heartland right now,\" Redfield said Thursday. \"We need to prevent that.\" Getting safety measures in place now is crucial, Murray said, before fall rolls around, when health officials have predicted the US will see a resurgence of coronavirus cases on top of flu season. Redfield has previously said this fall and winter are likely to be one of the \"most difficult times\" in American public health.\nOn Friday, the top health official for Seattle and King County in Washington warned the state was seeing an increased number of cases linked to social gatherings.\n\"We expect Covid-19 to get worse in the fall and winter and people to spend more time indoors,\" said health officer Dr. Jeffrey Duchin.\nTo help prevent widespread infections, Murray said governors need to put mask mandates in place -- mandates \"with teeth\" -- that would allow local authorities to fine residents without a face covering.\n\"It will take a concerted effort but the impact is extraordinary, it's really quite extraordinary what it could achieve,\" Murray said.\n6-year-old is Florida's youngest Covid-19 victim\nIn Florida, a 6-year-old girl became the youngest person in the state to die from coronavirus complications. Health officials say they still don't know if the child contracted the virus from a known case or if this was travel related.\nThe report of her death comes just weeks after 9-year-old Kimora \"Kimmie\" Lynum, who had no known underlying health conditions, died from coronavirus complications in Florida. Florida has reported more than 593,000 infections since the start of the pandemic, second only to California, which has recorded 660,000 positive results.\nThe girl's death comes as schools across the US have begun reopening. Some have adjusted plans after hundreds of students and staff were asked to quarantine in response to coronavirus cases. A Florida judge is expected to rule next week on whether schools should reopen with in-person classes. That stems from a lawsuit filed by a Florida teacher's union, which wants to stop the state from requiring schools to reopen for in-person instruction five days a week.",

Scientists globally are racing to find a way to stop to the virus that has infected more than 23 million people and claimed over 800,000 lives. Six vaccine candidates have started Phase 3 clinical trials -- the last step of testing to prove efficacy and safety before seeking approval from regulators -- and three are Chinese.\nCoronaVac's last-stage trials are being rolled out in Brazil and Indonesia with about 11,000 volunteers.\n\"If everything goes well, we hope that we can have some results around the end of the year,\" said Helen Yang, director of investor relations at Sinovac, from the CoronaVac production plant in the Chinese capital's Daxing district.\nThe Nasdaq-listed biotech company began developing its vaccine in late January, less than a week after Wuhan -- the original epicenter of China's coronavirus outbreak -- went into a strict lockdown. Construction of the plant started in March, and Yang said the facility will eventually produce 300 million doses of the vaccine a year, if it is approved by China's National Medical Products Administration. CoronaVac uses an old-fashioned approach -- employing an inactivated whole virus to prompt the body to develop immunity. The virus is grown under controlled conditions and killed chemically, so it cannot replicate to cause disease when injected into the body. This method has long been proven effective with other viruses, and is still used in polio and flu shots, as well as the rabies vaccine.\nA Sinovac spokesperson said the company chose an inactivated vaccine because it was most familiar with this approach.\nThe US is pushing ahead with a newer type of vaccine made using genetic material from the virus. This type of vaccine is faster to produce, because whole samples of a virus do not have to be cultured, but there is less known about which genetic material to choose from the virus to replicate to induce an strong immune response.\nTo fast-track the preclinical process -- where researchers develop the vaccine candidate and test it on animals -- Yang said the company had conducted several studies in parallel so it could select the best results.\nSinovac has also been working closely with China's equivalent of the Food and Drug Administration to speed up the approval process. \"Once we complete a certain study, we submit the data ... immediately so they can start to review,\" Yang added.\nIn May, Sinovac published in the journal Science the results of animal trials, which found that its vaccine induced effective antibodies in mice and rats, as well as primates such as the rhesus macaques. A month later, the company said its Phase 2 trial of 600 volunteers found the vaccine caused the human body to produce antibodies 14 days after vaccination.\nBut the Phrase 3 trial requires large-scale testing of thousands of participants.\nBy June, China had largely contained the coronavirus, contending with only small, sporadic outbreaks. China had reported 84,996 Covid-19 cases by Wednesday, with fewer than 2,000 new infections since the start of June -- and more than a third of those were imported, according to the country's National Health Commission (NHC).\nYang said the small number of newly reported Covid-19 cases in China didn't meet the necessary conditions for a Phase 3 trial, so Sinovac reached an agreement with Brazil -- which ranks second in the world for infections, with more than 3.6 million reported cases. In collaboration with the Butantan Institute in S\u00e3o Paulo, a Phase 3 study was launched in late July involving 9,000 volunteers, all health professionals who have worked with Covid-19 patients but haven't been infected with the virus, according to S\u00e3o Paulo officials.\nIn exchange, Brazil was promised 120 million doses of the vaccine, if the tests found it to be effective. The tests are ongoing, but Dimas Covas, president of the Butantan Institute, said Wednesday preliminary data shows CoronaVac induced immunity in 97% of the people vaccinated after two doses -- a level he said was \"fundamental to break the chain of transmission of the coronavirus.\"\nCovas said earlier this month that data on the efficacy of the vaccine could be available by October -- potentially starting the formal approval process in a matter of months. He expects the vaccine to be available to the Brazilian public by January.\n\"I am very optimistic. I think it would be a reasonable time frame given the performance so far,\" he said at a public hearing at the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies.\nThis month, Sinovac also rolled out another Phase 3 trial in Indonesia with 1,620 volunteers. Indonesia's state-owned Bio Farma said in a statement Friday that it signed a preliminary agreement with Sinovac for the bulk purchase of 50 million vaccines from November to March 2021, with guaranteed priority access until the end of next year.\nA race for vaccine\nWith the global race for vaccines heating up, Yang down played competition between biotech companies -- saying demand was too huge for a single company to meet.\nThe real competition, she said, is with the virus.\n\"Our speed should be faster than the transmission of the virus instead of competing with others. We like everyone to be successful then there will be enough supply to protect people,\" Yang said. The two other Chinese vaccines to have started Phase 3 trials are being developed by the state-owned Sinopharm, while a vaccine from the United Kingdom, produced by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca has reached this stage, along with two from the United States, one by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer in collaboration with German company BioNTech, and the other by Moderna.\nAs it stands, 13 companies in China are working on coronavirus vaccines. Of those, nine vaccine candidates are in human trials -- more than in any other country.\nIvan Hung, an infectious diseases specialist at the Hong Kong University School of Medicine, said vaccination is key for countries like China where strict measures have helped keep the percentage of infected people in the population low.\n\"The overall immunity is very low. And so in these places, definitely the way forward is vaccinations,\" he said. Geopolitical implications\nSenior US national security officials have warned of alleged Chinese government attempts to steal coronavirus research from American institutions for months. In July, US prosecutors charged two Chinese nationals accused of trying to steal Covid-19 vaccine research on behalf of the government.\nChina's leader Xi Jinping has repeatedly urged Chinese scientists to accelerate the research and development of coronavirus vaccines. Xiao Yaqing, the country's former top market regulator, told pharmaceutical companies last month to treat coronavirus vaccine development as an \"important political task.\"\nXiao has since been appointed the minister of industry and information technology.\nNot only would a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine save lives, deliver scientific prestige and represent a tantalizing opportunity for economic recovery, it could also have significant geopolitical implications.\nThe Chinese government has faced sharp criticism -- most notably from the US -- for its initial handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Its subsequent \"mask diplomacy\" -- an effort to ship medical supplies to countries grappling with Covid-19 -- has fueled suspicion that it is trying to change the coronavirus narrative.\nWinning the vaccine race would present China with an opportunity to shore up its global standing by positioning itself as a leader in fighting the pandemic.\nLast month, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said he had asked Xi to help the Southeast Asian nation get priority access to a Chinese vaccine.\nThe number of countries granted such access is growing fast. Besides Brazil and Indonesia, which have been approved for early access from Sinovac, Pakistan -- one of China's closest allies -- will receive early vaccine doses from Sinopharm, if its Phase 3 trials are successful.\nIn a video summit with African leaders in June, Xi pledged that \"once the development and deployment of Covid-19 vaccine is completed in China, African countries will be among the first to benefit.\"\nThis month, China's ambassador in Afghanistan, Wang Yu, told the Afghanistan Times that \"once China's vaccine is successfully developed and produced, it will be our priority to consider providing the vaccine to Afghan people.\"\nAnd on Monday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Beijing would also give priority access to Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam.\n\"Emergency use\"\nWithin China, authorities have rolled out coronavirus vaccines for \"emergency use\" before the last-stage trials are finished.\nLast weekend, a senior official from the NHC revealed that China has been using an experimental vaccine on people who work in high-risk professions since July, including front line medical professionals and border inspectors. The vaccine, developed by Sinopharm, is still in Phase 3 trials in the United Arab Emirates, Peru, Morocco and Argentina.\nZheng Zhongwei, director of the Science and Technology Development Center of the NHC, told China's state broadcaster that the \"emergency use\" of a vaccine during a \"major public health incident\" was in accordance with the country's vaccine law.\nIt comes after the Chinese government approved the use of a different vaccine candidate for the country's military in June.\nHowever, on Monday, Dr. Anthony Fauci -- the top US infectious disease expert -- warned against early emergency use authorization, explaining that such a step could damage efforts to develop other vaccines.\n\"One of the potential dangers if you prematurely let a vaccine out is that it would make it difficult, if not impossible, for the other vaccines to enroll people in their trial,\" he said.",

            "HeadLine": "New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern wants to eliminate coronavirus. Is she setting herself up to fail?",
            "Text": "(CNN)In mid-March, as the coronavirus pandemic began to take hold in Europe and the United States, New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern presented her country with a choice.\n\nThey could let coronavirus creep into the community and brace for an onslaught, as other countries around the world had done. Or they could \"go hard\" by closing the border -- even if that initially hurt the island nation's hugely tourism-dependant economy. Ardern opted for the second path. When New Zealand had only reported 28 cases, Ardern closed borders to foreigners, and when there were 102 cases, she announced a nationwide lockdown.\nIn effect, Ardern offered New Zealanders a deal: put up with some of the toughest rules in the world, and in return, be kept safe -- first from the deadly coronavirus, and later, from potential economic devastation.\nFor a while, it seemed that deal had paid off. New Zealand spent seven weeks under lockdown, five of them under strict rules that meant even takeaway food and traveling outside of their immediate neighborhood were off limits. But by June, life was basically back to normal -- and in August, New Zealand marked 100 days without any community transmission.\nThen, last week, that changed.\nThe country reported its first cases of community transmission in three months, forcing the country's most populous city, Auckland, back under lockdown. The national election was postponed for one of the few times in the country's history.\nSomehow, authorities said, the virus appeared to have crept in through the border. As of Thursday, New Zealand has 101 active cases, bringing the country's total reported coronavirus cases to 1,304, including 22 deaths. That prompted outrage from New Zealand's opposition parties, who questioned whether the government failed to uphold their end of the bargain. \"The Government has one job: keep the virus out of our community so we can avoid lockdowns. It has failed and we are all paying the price,\" said David Seymour, the leader of right-wing minority party ACT.\nAround Asia-Pacific, other countries that entered into similar implicit deals with their citizens are facing similar situations. Australia, for instance, also took swift, tough action at the start of the pandemic -- but issues at the border lead to an outbreak in the state of Victoria, prompting the country's second-biggest city, Melbourne, to return to a lockdown and be placed under a curfew.\nNow, as those in Europe go on holiday, people in parts of New Zealand and Australia -- two countries that were once held up as examples of how to handle the virus -- remain under lockdown. To some, that begs the question: did they take the right approach? And by promising safety, were governments like Ardern's always setting themselves up to fail?\nInevitable outbreak?\nRight from the start, Ardern was clear -- she didn't want to simply limit the impact of coronavirus, she wanted to eliminate it.\nElimination -- which the New Zealand health authorities defined as stopping the chains of transmission in the country -- was an ambitious goal, and one that few nations adopted.\nBut Ardern and her government said it was the right one to protect the health of both the public and the economy -- and by April, New Zealand announced that it had achieved its goal of eliminating the virus.\nFor months, New Zealand had no instances of community transmission, but even before the country announced its fresh cases, health authorities and experts were warning that another outbreak was inevitable. Shortly before New Zealand marked 100 days without any coronavirus transmission, Director-General of Health Dr. Ashley Bloomfield advised people to stock up on face masks.\n\"I don't think it's scaremongering asking ask people to prepare for potential natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis and so on - it's actually looking after people,\" he said on a Facebook Live Q&A session. \"This is about being prepared.\" For some people, that didn't really make sense. Only New Zealanders can come into the country, and even then, they must spend 14 days in a state-run quarantine facility and be tested twice for coronavirus. If the borders were secure, then why would a new outbreak be inevitable?\nThe problem in this case is that the borders weren't that secure. Authorities have admitted that workers at New Zealand's border facilities -- people who would have been most vulnerable to catching the virus -- weren't being tested on a regular basis.\n\"I want to acknowledge, at the outset, that testing of staff working at our border has been too slow,\" Health Minister Chris Hipkins said Tuesday. \"It has not met the very clear expectations of Minister, the decisions that Cabinet has made were not implemented in a timely or a robust manner, and that is disappointing and frustrating.\"\nBut even if the authorities hadn't made errors, it's possible to imagine a scenario where an infectious person could slip through the cracks. We know that false negative tests happen, so there's a very small chance a person could be Covid-19 positive and still be infectious when they are let out into the community after 14 days.\nAs top scientist Peter Gluckman, former Prime Minister Helen Clark, and former Air New Zealand chief executive Rob Fyfe wrote in a paper in July: \"As smugglers have known for centuries, border controls are never foolproof.\"\nWhat the outbreak means for Ardern\nIt's never a good time for a resurgence of coronavirus, but the timing of this latest outbreak is particularly bad for Ardern.\nIn April, when New Zealand was under its strict lockdown, a survey showed 88% of New Zealanders trusted the government's pandemic response, state broadcaster TVNZ reported. In the months since, Ardern's party soared in popularity to well over 50%.\nBut now, with the election only eight weeks away, Ardern's opponents have seized on the problems at the border.\nOn Thursday, Judith Collins, the leader of the main right-wing opposition National Party, launched its own proposed border policy, saying that the government's \"disorderly and confused response\" had put the health and livelihoods of 5 million New Zealanders at risk.\nOthers questioned whether New Zealand's focus on elimination was the right approach after all.\n\"Our attempt to eliminate Covid is an obsession that will destroy us,\" wrote columnist Damien Grant on the country's biggest news website, Stuff.co.nz. He echoed sentiments that have been rattling around New Zealand for a while -- in their paper in July, Gluckman, Clark and Fyfe questioned whether New Zealand could afford to wait out another year or two \"in almost total physical isolation.\"\n\"We were told we went hard and early and we stayed longer in lockdown the first time, those additional hard weeks, because we wanted to avoid a yo-yo back into lockdown, and here we are again,\" Paul Goldsmith, from the National Party, said Tuesday.  As Goldsmith noted, there isn't just a health risk in the virus returning -- there's an economic one from a return to lockdown.\nAuckland makes up about 40% of New Zealand's economy, and the country set aside another half a billion New Zealand dollars ($327 million) to help support workers during the city's current lockdown. Lockdowns also come with other costs -- like other countries, New Zealand saw a rise in domestic violence reports during its first nationwide lockdown, national broadcaster Radio New Zealand reported. Ardern and her party will try to play up the benefits that have come from their strict handling, even if hasn't been perfect.\nThe Prime Minister has consistently said that the best economic strategy is to win the fight against Covid-19. After all, there are costs to letting the virus spiral out of control. An out of control outbreak would have economic impacts anyway, and on top of that, there's health resources, the cost of a slow recovery from coronavirus, and death.\nSo far, statistics show that New Zealand's tough approach hasn't had a devastating economic cost. Earlier this month, the government reported only 4% unemployment, although the underutilization rate grew from 10.4% to 12%, the largest quarterly rise since 2004.\n\"What we're finding internationally is that countries that have control of Covid-19, like China, even if they're experiencing occasional outbreaks, have stronger economies,\" said Dominick Stephens, Westpac NZ's chief economist, in a video statement last Friday. \"Those countries that have lost control of the virus like the United States are seeing economic forecasts constantly revised down and are weaker economically.\"\nWhile Ardern's critics are getting louder, there's still goodwill toward the Prime Minister and her government -- it wasn't so long ago that New Zealand was the envy of the world. And New Zealand authorities have acted swiftly -- a day after the new cases were announced last week, Auckland went into lockdown, and more than 100,000 tests were processed within five days.\nBut Ardern's real test is yet to come. When the country heads to the polls in October, she'll be hoping that, despite the hiccups, the country still thinks her tough coronavirus approach was worth it.",

            "HeadLine": "FDA rejects oleandrin, an unproven coronavirus therapeutic pushed by MyPillow CEO, as a dietary supplement ingredient",
            "Text": "(CNN)The US Food and Drug Administration has rejected a submission from Phoenix Biotechnology Inc. to market oleandrin as a dietary supplement ingredient, citing \"significant concerns\" about the safety evidence the company presented.\n\nLast month, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, who recently joined the board of Phoenix Biotechnology and has a financial stake in the company, said he had participated in a July meeting at the White House with President Donald Trump regarding the use of oleandrin as a potential therapeutic for the coronavirus.\nThe extract comes from the Nerium oleander plant; the raw oleander plant is highly toxic and consuming it can be fatal. There are no peer-reviewed, published studies on the impact of oleandrin on Covid-19, and there's no public evidence it has been studied in patients with Covid-19. On June 2, Phoenix Biotechnology submitted oleandrin to the FDA as a new ingredient in dietary supplements, describing the dosage and saying it's intended only for adults. If a dietary supplement contains a new ingredient, manufacturers must notify the FDA, and the agency will review it for safety -- not effectiveness -- and determine whether it may be marketed as a dietary supplement.\nThe FDA's response letter, dated August 14, was posted by the agency on Wednesday. It said the company had already tested oleandrin as a potential prescription drug and could not at the same time seek permission to sell it as a supplement -- a category with almost no oversight.\nEven if it hadn't been excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement under the law, the agency had \"significant concerns about the evidence included in your submission as a basis for concluding that a dietary supplement containing 'Oleandrin' will reasonably be expected to be safe\" if used the way the company described. The FDA said Phoenix Biotechnology provided evidence of a history of medicinal use of Nerium oleander extracts and some evidence of preclinical and clinical studies, but the safety evidence was not \"qualitatively and quantitatively\" related to oleandrin as a supplement.\n\"Studies performed in advanced cancer patients generally cannot establish the safety of your ingredient in its intended population of normal healthy adults, and you did not provide any information to indicate that such extrapolation between different populations would be scientifically valid,\" the FDA's letter said.\nThe FDA's letter did not mention using the extract as a treatment for Covid-19.\nLindell, who has no scientific background or medical training, has said previously he was so enthusiastic about the product as a Covid-19 treatment that he had started taking the extract as a prophylactic and has encouraged his friends to do the same.\nHe had brought his research to Housing and Urban Development Secretary Dr. Ben Carson, a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Lindell said in July that Carson was \"just amazed,\" and thought \"it was very exciting seeing all the data.\"\nAfter Lindell met with Trump in July, he described the President's response to the extract as \"enthusiastic.\" Lindell told CNN in July that Trump wanted the FDA to \"do its course.\"\nWhen asked about the extract in August, Trump said he had \"heard about\" oleandrin and said, \"We'll look at it, we'll look at it, we're looking at a lot of different things.\" It's unclear if Trump raised the issue with the FDA.",

            "HeadLine": "Europe pushed the limit of how far to reopen. Now it may be too late to prevent a second virus wave",
            "Text": "(CNN)Coronavirus cases in Europe are \"almost back\" to the levels seen in March when infection rates first peaked, scientists have warned as concerns grow over a potential second wave.\n\nCountries across the continent have been easing lockdowns and reopening restaurants, retail stores and offices in an effort to kick-start their economies. But the relaxation of restrictions has seen a surge in infections that puts Europe in a vulnerable position.\n\"The virus hasn't been sleeping over the summer, so it didn't take vacation and that is something that we see now,\" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), said on Wednesday during a debate held by the European Union. She said the rise in reported infection rates had been slower than in March, when countries such as Italy and Spain were hit particularly hard by Covid-19, but had now been increasing for weeks.\nHowever, deaths in Europe are down from a seven-day rolling average of about 4,000 in early April to around 300 at the start of September, according to CNN analysis of figures from Johns Hopkins University.\n\"We have seen now this week that the notification rate in the EU and EEA [European Economic Area] countries and the UK is now 46 per 100,000,\" Ammon said. \"You may remember that at one point we have been already below 15, so there is an increase and this increase we have been seeing now for more than five weeks ... We are almost back to the numbers that we have seen in March.\"\nIn mid-August, the ECDC said that new infection clusters seemed to be tied to younger people who were venturing out into bars, restaurants and other public places.\nAmmon said Wednesday that the resurgence was now also being seen among older demographics. \"In August ... we are seeing more that also [an] older population is affected, indicating that it's really a true increase in transmission,\" she said. Professor Mark Woolhouse, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh, told CNN that while initial lockdowns had helped to slow the rapidly escalating epidemic and bring case numbers down, \"it was simply pushing the problem a few months down the line.\"\n\"Now we're facing the problem we had in March, that the virus is out there, it has the potential to cause a major epidemic just as it did in March; in that respect, we're no further forward at all, we simply delayed everything,\" he said.\nWoolhouse said it was important to be cautious when comparing case numbers, because most countries now have far greater testing capacity than in March, but he noted that the proportion of tests coming back positive is also starting to increase. \"Out of all the indicators ... that's the one that catches my eye,\" he said.\n\"It comes back to this crucial R number [reproduction number, which indicates the spread of the virus], of whether it's above one or below one, but in the early stages of first wave it was near three. And I simply cannot see it being allowed to get anywhere close back to that,\" Woolhouse added. He added that countries now have better surveillance and can have more targeted local lockdowns, but careful monitoring is vital.\n\"If we're going to try and return to some form of normality, we have very little option other than to take it easy, take it cautiously, and see what happens ... there is a two- or three-week lag in the system.\"\nSchools have recently reopened in many European countries, but Ammon said there were still \"very few significant outbreaks in schools that have been documented and the evidence is really at the moment conflicting [on] whether it's useful or not from a transmission point of view to close schools.\"\nFrance, Germany, Italy have all reported their highest new case numbers in months, and Spain last week hit its record 24-hour tally for the entire pandemic. Countries including Greece and Croatia, largely spared by the first wave, saw fast case number rises in August as tourists took summer vacations following June's reopening of Europe's internal borders.\nGovernments hoping to avoid second national lockdowns have introduced new measures including nightclub closures, curfews and mandatory masks in public spaces. But the rules have been met with mass protests in countries such as Germany and the UK.\nAs the days grow shorter, Europe is preparing for the next phase of this ever-changing battle.",

            "HeadLine": "2014-2016 Ebola Outbreak in West Africa",
            "Text": "On March 23, 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported cases of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in the forested rural region of southeastern Guinea. The identification of these early cases marked the beginning of the West Africa Ebola epidemic, the largest in history.\n\nSummary\nThe initial case, or index patient, was reported in December 2013. An 18-month-old boy from a small village in Guinea is believed to have been infected by bats. After five additional cases of fatal diarrhea occurred in that area, an official medical alert was issued on January 24, 2014, to the district health officials. The Ebola virus soon spread to Guinea\u2019s capital city of Conakry, and on March 13, 2014, the Ministry of Health in Guinea issued an alert for an unidentified illness. Shortly after, the Pasteur Institute in France confirmed the illness as EVD caused by Zaire ebolavirus. On March 23, 2014, with 49 confirmed cases and 29 deaths, the WHO officially declared an outbreak of EVD.\n\nWeak surveillance systems and poor public health infrastructure contributed to the difficulty surrounding the containment of this outbreak and it quickly spread to Guinea\u2019s bordering countries, Liberia and Sierra Leone. By July 2014, the outbreak spread to the capitals of all three countries. This was the first time EVD extended out from more isolated, rural areas and into densely populated urban centers, providing an unprecedented opportunity for transmission.\n\nOn August 8, 2014, WHO declared the deteriorating situation in West Africa a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), which is designated only for events with a risk of potential international spread or that require a coordinated international response. Over the duration of the epidemic, EVD spread to seven more countries: Italy, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Later secondary infection, mainly in a healthcare setting, occurred in Italy, Mali, Nigeria, and the United States.\n\nThe scope of this outbreak, both in terms of cases and geography, can be attributed to the unprecedented circulation of EVD into crowded urban areas, increased mobilization across borders, and conflicts between key infection control practices and prevailing cultural and traditional practices in West Africa. Engaging local leaders in prevention programs and messaging, along with careful policy implementation at the national and global level, helped to eventually contain the spread of the virus and put an end to this outbreak.\n\nLiberia was first declared Ebola-free in May 2015. Additional cases were found and treated, and the country was again declared Ebola-free in September 2015. More cases were discovered in November 2015. On January 14, 2016, Liberia again announced it was Ebola-free; however, cases were detected in March and April of 2016, and Liberia made its final declaration on June 1, 2016.\n\nAfter an initial declaration in November 2015, Sierra Leone announced a new case of EVD in January 2016 and declared it was Ebola-free on March 17, 2016. In Guinea, the first end of outbreak declaration was in December 2015, but additional cases were discovered in March and April of 2016. Guinea was finally declared Ebola-free in June 2016. [1] Two and a half years after the first case was discovered, the outbreak ended with more than 28,600 cases and 11,325 deaths.\n\nEbola in the United States\nOverall, eleven people were treated for Ebola in the United States during the 2014-2016 epidemic. On September 30, 2014, CDC confirmed the first travel-associated case of EVD diagnosed in the United States in a man who traveled from West Africa to Dallas, Texas. The patient (the index case) died on October 8, 2014. Two healthcare workers who cared for him in Dallas tested positive for EVD. Both recovered.\n\nOn October 23, 2014, a medical aid worker who had volunteered in Guinea was hospitalized in New York City with suspected EVD. The diagnosis was confirmed by the CDC the next day. The patient recovered.\n\nSeven other people were cared for in the United States after they were exposed to the virus and became ill while in West Africa, the majority of whom were medical workers. They were transported by chartered aircraft from West Africa to hospitals in the United States. Six of these patients recovered, one died.[2]\n\nCDC Response\nCDC activated its Emergency Operations Center in July 2014 to help coordinate technical assistance and disease control activities with partners. CDC personnel deployed to West Africa to assist with response efforts, including surveillance, contact tracing, data management, laboratory testing, and health education. CDC staff also provided support with logistics, staffing, communication, analytics, and management.\n\nTo prevent cross-border transmission, travelers leaving West Africa were screened at airports. Exit screening helped identify those at risk for EVD and prevent the spread of the disease to other countries. The United States also implemented enhanced entry screening for travelers coming from Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Mali by routing them to designated airports better able to assess travelers for risk.[3]\n\nDuring the height of the response, CDC trained 24,655 healthcare workers in West Africa on infection prevention and control practices.[4] In the United States, more than 6,500 people were trained during live training events throughout the response. In addition, laboratory capacity was expanded in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone with 24 laboratories able to test for Ebola virus by the end of 2015.[5]\n\nImpact\nOn March 29, 2016, the WHO lifted the PHEIC status on West Africa\u2019s Ebola situation. The impact this epidemic had on the world, and particularly West Africa, is significant. A total of 28,616 cases of EVD and 11,310 deaths were reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. There were an additional 36 cases and 15 deaths that occurred when the outbreak spread outside of these three countries. The table below shows the distribution of cases and deaths in countries with widespread transmission and countries affected by the epidemic.

During the epidemic, Liberia lost 8% of its doctors, nurses, and midwives to EVD.[6] In addition to the devastating effects on the healthcare workforce in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, the Ebola epidemic severely impacted the provision of healthcare services and caused setbacks in the treatment and control of HIV, tuberculosis, measles, and malaria in these countries.[7]\n\nThe epidemic also had a great impact on children. Nearly 20% of all EVD cases occurred in children under 15 years of age, and an estimated 30,000 children became orphans during this epidemic. As funding and logistics previously dedicated to child vaccination campaigns were redirected to Ebola response or postponed to avoid public gatherings, routine immunizations decreased by 30%, further putting children at risk of getting vaccine-preventable diseases.[8], [9]\n\nThe epidemic has been estimated to cost a total of $4.3 billion USD.[10] Investments in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone dramatically decreased. Similarly, the  countries experienced a substantial loss in private sector growth, decline in agricultural production leading to concerns about food security, and a decrease in cross-border trade as restrictions on movements, goods, and services increased.[11], [12], [13]\n\nCurrent Guidance\nWhile the spread of EVD in West Africa has been controlled, additional cases may continue to occur from time to time. However, because of ongoing surveillance and strengthened response capabilities, the affected countries now have the experience and tools to rapidly identify cases and limit the spread of the disease.\n\nCDC no longer recommends that U.S. residents avoid nonessential travel to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone. Although there is believed to be no risk of EVD to travelers in these countries, travelers should, as usual, avoid contact with sick people, dead bodies, or blood and body fluids.",

EVD most commonly affects people and nonhuman primates (such as monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees). It is caused by an infection with a group of viruses within the genus Ebolavirus:\n\nEbola virus (species Zaire ebolavirus)\nSudan virus (species Sudan ebolavirus)\nTa\u00ef Forest virus (species Ta\u00ef Forest ebolavirus, formerly C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire ebolavirus)\nBundibugyo virus (species Bundibugyo ebolavirus)\nReston virus (species Reston ebolavirus)\nBombali virus (species Bombali ebolavirus)\nOf these, only four (Ebola, Sudan, Ta\u00ef Forest, and Bundibugyo viruses) are known to cause disease in people. Reston virus is known to cause disease in nonhuman primates and pigs, but not in people. It is unknown if Bombali virus, which was recently identified in bats, causes disease in either animals or people.\n\nEbola virus was first discovered in 1976 near the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. Since then, the virus has been infecting people from time to time, leading to outbreaks in several African countries. Scientists do not know where Ebola virus comes from. However, based on the nature of similar viruses, they believe the virus is animal-borne, with bats or nonhuman primates with bats or nonhuman primates (chimpanzees, apes, monkeys, etc.) being the most likely source. Infected animals carrying the virus can transmit it to other animals, like apes, monkeys, duikers and humans.\n\nThe virus spreads to people initially through direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of animals. Ebola virus then spreads to other people through direct contact with body fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from EVD. This can occur when a person touches these infected body fluids (or objects that are contaminated with them), and the virus gets in through broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth. People can get the virus through sexual contact with someone who is sick with EVD, and also after recovery from EVD. The virus can persist in certain body fluids, like semen, after recovery from the illness.",

This is called a spillover event. After that, the virus spreads from person to person, potentially affecting a large number of people.\n\nThe virus spreads through direct contact (such as through broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth) with:\n\nEbola Exposure Calculator\nan icon of the Ebola virus\nThis mobile app estimates when a person with Ebola was exposed to the virus.\n\nBlood or body fluids (urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk, and semen) of a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola virus disease (EVD).\nObjects (such as clothes, bedding, needles, and medical equipment) contaminated with body fluids from a person who is sick with or has died from EVD.\nInfected fruit bats or nonhuman primates (such as apes and monkeys).\nSemen from a man who recovered from EVD (through oral, vaginal, or anal sex). The virus can remain in certain body fluids (including semen) of a patient who has recovered from EVD, even if they no longer have symptoms of severe illness. There is no evidence that Ebola can be spread through sex or other contact with vaginal fluids from a woman who has had Ebola.\nWhen people become infected with Ebola, they do not start developing signs or symptoms right away. This period between exposure to an illness and having symptoms is known as the incubation period. A person can only spread Ebola to other people after they develop signs and symptoms of Ebola.\n\nAdditionally, Ebola virus is not known to be transmitted through food. However, in certain parts of the world, Ebola virus may spread through the handling and consumption of wild animal meat or hunted wild animals infected with Ebola. There is no evidence that mosquitoes or other insects can transmit Ebola virus.\n\nRisk\nHealth workers who do not use proper infection control while caring for Ebola patients, and family and friends in close contact with Ebola patients, are at the highest risk of getting sick. Ebola can spread when people come into contact with infected blood or body fluids.\nEbola poses little risk to travelers or the general public who have not cared for or been in close contact (within 3 feet or 1 meter) with someone sick with Ebola.\nPersistence of the virus\nThe virus can remain in areas of the body that are immunologically privileged sites after acute infection. These are sites where viruses and pathogens, like the Ebola virus, are shielded from the survivor\u2019s immune system, even after being cleared elsewhere in the body. These areas include the testes, interior of the eyes, placenta, and central nervous system, particularly the cerebrospinal fluid. Whether the virus is present in these body parts and for how long varies by survivor. Scientists are now studying how long the virus stays in these body fluids among Ebola survivors.\n\nDuring an Ebola outbreak, the virus can spread quickly within healthcare settings (such as clinics or hospitals). Clinicians and other healthcare personnel providing care should use dedicated, preferably disposable, medical equipment. Proper cleaning and disposal of instruments such as needles and syringes are important. If instruments are not disposable, they must be sterilized before using again.\n\nEbola virus can survive on dry surfaces, like doorknobs and countertops for several hours; in body fluids like blood, the virus can survive up to several days at room temperature. Cleaning and disinfection should be performed using a hospital-grade disinfectant.",

            "Text": "Emergence of Ebola in Humans\nEbola virus disease (EVD), one of the deadliest viral diseases, was discovered in 1976 when two consecutive outbreaks of fatal hemorrhagic fever occurred in different parts of Central Africa. The first outbreak occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire) in a village near the Ebola River, which gave the virus its name. The second outbreak occurred in what is now South Sudan, approximately 500 miles (850 km) away.\n\nInitially, public health officials assumed these outbreaks were a single event associated with an infected person who traveled between the two locations. However, scientists later discovered that the two outbreaks were caused by two genetically distinct viruses: Zaire ebolavirus and Sudan ebolavirus. After this discovery, scientists concluded that the virus came from two different sources and spread independently to people in each of the affected areas.\n\nViral and epidemiologic data suggest that Ebola virus existed long before these recorded outbreaks occurred.  Factors like population growth, encroachment into forested areas, and direct interaction with wildlife (such as bushmeat consumption) may have contributed to the spread of the Ebola virus.\n\nIdentifying a Host\nFollowing the discovery of the virus, scientists studied thousands of animals, insects, and plants in search of its source (called reservoir among virologists, people who study viruses). Gorillas, chimpanzees, and other mammals may be implicated when the first cases of an EVD outbreak in people occur. However, they \u2013 like people \u2013 are \u201cdead-end\u201d hosts, meaning the organism dies following the infection and does not survive and spread the virus to other animals. Like other viruses of its kind, it is possible that the reservoir host animal of Ebola virus does not experience acute illness despite the virus being present in its organs, tissues, and blood. Thus, the virus is likely maintained in the environment by spreading from host to host or through intermediate hosts or vectors.\n\nAfrican fruit bats are likely involved in the spread of Ebola virus and may even be the source animal (reservoir host). Scientists continue to search for conclusive evidence of the bat\u2019s role in transmission of Ebola. 1 The most recent Ebola virus to be detected, Bombali virus, was identified in samples from bats collected in Sierra Leone.2 History of Ebola Outbreaks\nSince its discovery in 1976, the majority of cases and outbreaks of Ebola Virus Disease have occurred in Africa. The 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa began in a rural setting of southeastern Guinea, spread to urban areas and across borders within weeks, and became a global epidemic within months.\n\nEbola Hemorrhagic Fever Distribution Map\nUnderstanding Pathways of Transmission\nThe use of contaminated needles and syringes during the earliest outbreaks enabled transmission and amplification of Ebola virus. During the first outbreak in Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 DRC), nurses in the Yambuku mission hospital reportedly used five syringes for 300 to 600 patients a day. Close contact with infected blood, reuse of contaminated needles, and improper nursing techniques were the source for much of the human-to-human transmission during early Ebola outbreaks.3\n\nIn 1989, Reston ebolavirus was discovered in research monkeys imported from the Philippines into the U.S. Later, scientists confirmed that the virus spread throughout the monkey population through droplets in the air (aerosolized transmission) in the facility. However, such airborne transmission is not proven to be a significant factor in human outbreaks of Ebola.4 The discovery of the Reston virus in these monkeys from the Philippines revealed that Ebola was no longer confined to African settings, but was present in Asia as well.\n\nBy the 1994 Cote d\u2019Ivoire outbreak, scientists and public health officials had a better understanding of how Ebola virus spreads and progress was made to reduce transmission through the use of face masks, gloves and gowns for healthcare personnel. In addition, the use of disposable equipment, such as needles, was introduced.\n\nDuring the 1995 Kikwit, Zaire (now DRC) outbreak, the international public health community played a strong role, as it was now widely agreed that containment and control of Ebola virus were paramount in ending outbreaks. The local community was educated on how the disease spreads; the hospital was properly staffed and stocked with necessary equipment; and healthcare personnel was trained on disease reporting, patient case identification, and methods for reducing transmission in the healthcare setting.5\n\nIn the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, healthcare workers represented only 3.9% of all confirmed and probable cases of EVD in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea combined.6  In comparison, healthcare workers accounted for 25% of all infections during the 1995 outbreak in Kikwit.7 During the 2014-2015 West Africa outbreak, the majority of transmission events were between family members (74%). Direct contact with the bodies of those who died from EVD proved to be one of the most dangerous \u2013 and effective \u2013 methods of transmission. Changes in behaviors related to mourning and burial, along with the adoption of safe burial practices, were critical in controlling that epidemic.8",

EVD is most common in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, with occasional outbreaks occurring in people. In these areas, Ebola virus is believed to circulate at low rates in certain animal populations (enzootic). Occasionally people become sick with Ebola after coming into contact with these infected animals, which can then lead to Ebola outbreaks where the virus spreads between people.\n\nWhen living in or traveling to a region where Ebola virus is present, there are a number of ways to protect yourself and prevent the spread of EVD\n\nContact with blood and body fluids (such as urine, feces, saliva, sweat, vomit, breast milk, semen, and vaginal fluids) of persons who are ill.\nContact with semen from a man who has recovered from EVD, until testing verifies the virus is gone from the semen.\nItems that may have come in contact with an infected person\u2019s blood or body fluids (such as clothes, bedding, needles, and medical equipment).\nFuneral or burial rituals that require handling the body of someone who died from EVD.\nContact with bats and nonhuman primates\u2019 blood, fluids, or raw meat prepared from these animals (bushmeat).\nContact with the raw meat of an unknown source.\nThese same prevention methods apply when living in or traveling to an area affected by an Ebola outbreak.

The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is a single dose vaccine regimen that has been found to be safe and protective against only the Zaire ebolavirus species of ebolavirus. This is the first FDA approval of a vaccine for Ebola.\n\nAnother investigational vaccine was developed and introduced under a research protocol in 2019 to combat an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This vaccine leverages two different vaccine components (Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo) and requires two doses with an initial dose followed by a second \u201cbooster\u201d dose 56 days later.

The fifth, Reston virus, has caused illness in some animals, but not in humans.\nThe first human outbreaks occurred in 1976, one in northern Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo) in central Africa: and the other, in southern Sudan (now South Sudan). The virus is named after the Ebola River, where the virus was first recognized in 1976, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nEbola is extremely infectious but not extremely contagious. It is infectious, because an infinitesimally small amount can cause illness. Laboratory experiments on nonhuman primates suggest that even a single virus may be enough to trigger a fatal infection.\nEbola is considered moderately contagious because the virus is not transmitted through the air.\nHumans can be infected by other humans if they come in contact with body fluids from an infected person or contaminated objects from infected persons. Humans can also be exposed to the virus, for example, by butchering infected animals.\nSymptoms of Ebola typically include: weakness, fever, aches, diarrhea, vomiting and stomach pain. Additional experiences include rash, red eyes, chest pain, throat soreness, difficulty breathing or swallowing and bleeding (including internal).\nTypically, symptoms appear eight to 10 days after exposure to the virus, but the incubation period can span two to 21 days.\nEbola is not transmissible if someone is asymptomatic and usually not after someone has recovered from it. However, the virus has been found in the semen of men who have recovered from Ebola and possibly could be transmitted from contact with that semen.\nThere are five subspecies of the Ebola virus: Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV), Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BDBV), Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), Ta\u00ef Forest ebolavirus (TAFV) and Reston ebolavirus (RESTV).\nClick here for the CDC's list of known cases and outbreaks.\n2014-2016 West Africa Outbreak\n(Full historical timeline at bottom)\nMarch 2014 - The CDC issues its initial announcement on an outbreak in Guinea, and reports of cases in Liberia and Sierra Leone.\nApril 16, 2014 - The New England Journal of Medicine publishes a report, speculating that the current outbreak's Patient Zero was a 2-year-old from Guinea.

            "Text": "(CNN)The Democratic Republic of Congo's battle against the world's second-deadliest Ebola outbreak on record is officially over, the country's health minister, Eteni Longondo, announced Thursday.\n\nDr. Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization regional director for Africa, said the announcement was made after no new cases were reported 42 days since the last survivor tested negative for the virus.\n\"It wasn't easy and at times it seemed like a mission impossible,\" Moeti said.\nSome 16,000 frontline workers battled for almost two years against the country's 10th outbreak, Moeti said.\nDespite successfully deploying two separate vaccines, the outbreak claimed more than 2,200 lives, with the response continually hampered by community mistrust and violence in the country's volatile northeastern provinces. The country now turns its attention to battling Covid-19 as well as its 11th Ebola outbreak, already underway in Mbandaka, in the country's western Equateur Province.\nMoeti said there are many lessons that have been learned from overcoming Ebola that can be used in the fight against Covid-19.\n\"One of the most important lessons . . . is the need to engage with, work with, enable communities to be knowledgeable, to be empowered to play their role in different ways,\" Moeti said.\nCall for caution\nUNICEF, the United Nations' children's agency, said it \"welcomes\" the announcement but warned the fight isn't over yet in the Democratic Republic of Congo\nEdouard Beigbeder, UNICEF DRC representative, said a large number of human resources and finances were deployed in the eastern region of the country to reach the end of the current outbreak.\nBeigbeder said UNICEF supplied water, hygiene services, and psychosocial support to children and informed millions of people on how to protect themselves from Ebola.\n\"These valuable lessons are helping us in our current effort to tackle the new Ebola outbreak in Equateur Province, while also responding to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic,\" Beigbeder said.\nThe new outbreak and Covid-19 are showing the world it's important for international donors to support the country's already overburdened health systems to fight against \"the disease and tackle the impacts on children and their families,\" UNICEF said.",

            "Text": "(CNN)The novel coronavirus is an unprecedented threat. We don't know how bad it will be or for how long it will spread, but we do know that it has already infected more than 118,000 people around the world -- and probably many times that number, killed more than 4,000 people and caused serious global economic damage. We need to adapt our responses to different countries and different parts of the same country in order to limit damage. Using data well is essential to an effective response.\n\nA business that markets a product that no one buys stops making it. If lots of people buy, you make more. Government doesn't have sales figures to go by; public decisions have to be based on other data.\nWe lack crucial information about the new virus. Here are three areas where we need more data (additional important knowledge gaps here):\nHow is the virus spreading? How much do asymptomatic cases spread disease? Are contaminated surfaces important sources of spread?\nHow deadly is the virus? Reported fatality rates likely overestimate death rates because there are many undiagnosed cases.\nWhat works to limit spread? For example, since children don't appear to get ill, even if infected, they may not be important sources of infection -- so school closures may have limited value. We learn more every day. We will be able to reduce infections, save lives, and limit damage to society if we rapidly collect, analyze and use data.\nHere are three relevant examples of how public health specialists used data to respond to the Ebola epidemic.\nRapid response. In Liberia, a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention team, working with national counterparts, recognized that a one-week delay in response allowed a cluster of cases to spread widely for months. They designed RITE -- Rapid Isolation and Treatment of Ebola -- to respond to new cases within days, even in remote areas of the country. This strategy mopped up clusters around the country and helped end the epidemic. The coronavirus may not be able to be controlled in that way, but experience from Wuhan, which didn't respond rapidly, compared with the rest of China, which did, suggests that a rapid response will reduce cases and save lives. Key lesson: act fast, including by stopping large public gatherings, when the virus first starts to spread. Support quarantined communities. In Guinea, community resistance to the unfamiliar actions needed to quell Ebola -- particularly burial without touching the body and hospitalization in treatment units families could not visit -- led to continued spread of the virus and violence against health workers. Eventually, the government established an innovative micro-cerclage -- micro-encirclement -- approach. Rather than seal a community off, public health officials engaged community leaders, provided services including food and primary health care, and allowed people entry and exit while collecting their phone numbers and tracking their movement. We knew the strategy was a success when communities that didn't have Ebola cases requested their own micro-cerclage. Key lesson: support communities.\nUnderstand community culture. Also in Guinea, a quick and revealing analysis determined that the Ebola cases most likely to transmit disease to others were patients who had died: their contacts were three times more likely to get Ebola than contacts of people who had survived. Furthermore, the supposedly safe burial programs weren't working: contacts of deceased patients who had been \"safely\" buried were no less likely to get Ebola. This confirmed the observation of field teams that, because of longstanding cultural practices, families had lovingly washed and dressed the bodies of patients who had died before calling a burial team. Key lesson: work with culture, not against it.\nData is key to all effective public health programs. In New York City, when we raised tobacco taxes and made all indoor public places smoke-free, smoking rates declined at first but then the decline stalled. Because we had a tracking system in place, we realized that progress had stalled and added hard-hitting anti-tobacco ads to the mix. Our programs quickly reduced adult and teen smoking, preventing more than 100,000 deaths. Every country facing the coronavirus pandemic needs to strengthen systems to track diseases, confirm diagnoses through a strong laboratory network, investigate expertly and respond rapidly and effectively. Fast action that supports communities and works with cultural norms in the US and globally will save lives and save money. But building the capacity to do this isn't free, and in the dozens of low- and middle-income countries where nearly 4 billion people live, it will cost approximately $1 to $2 per person per year for at least 10 years -- at least $30 billion. That's a lot of money for public health, but it's a tiny fraction of the amount lost by not knowing what we need to know about health threats, when we need to know them.\nGetting the data right is rarely quick and never easy, but it is always crucially important if we want to respond effectively, limit spread, save lives and protect our communities and economy.",

            "Text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness (see list of symptoms). It is caused by a virus (SARS-COV-2).\n\nCOVID-19 can sometimes cause serious health problems. People at increased risk for severe illness include:\n\nOlder people\nPeople of any age who have certain underlying medical conditions How COVID-19 Spreads\nCOVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning about it. Here\u2019s what we currently know:\n\nIt mainly spreads from person-to-person.\nBetween people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).\nThrough respiratory droplets produced when a person who has COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, or talks.\nYou can get the virus from people who don\u2019t seem sick or have symptoms.\nYou might be able to get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching your face, mouth, nose, or your eyes.\nAs a transit maintenance worker, you might come into contact with the virus at your job when\n\nIn close contact with passengers and coworkers.\nTouching frequently touched surfaces such as door handles, handrails or tools and then touching your face, mouth, nose, or eyes.\nHow You Can Protect Yourself and Others\nStay home if you are having symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nFollow CDC recommended steps if you are sick.\nDo not return to work until you meet the criteria to discontinue home isolation.\nTalk with your healthcare provider about when it\u2019s safe for you to return to work and coordinate with your employer.\nFollow CDC recommended precautions.\nTell your supervisor if you are well but someone you live with or someone you have had recent close contact with has COVID-19.\nStay at least 6 feet away from passengers and coworkers, when possible.\n\nWear a cloth face covering or mask in public, and at work when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Face coverings or masks may prevent people who don\u2019t know they have the virus from spreading it to others.\n\nBe careful when putting on and taking off cloth face coverings or masks:\nWash your hands before putting on and after taking off the cloth face covering or mask.\nDon\u2019t touch your face covering or mask while wearing it.\nDon\u2019t touch your face, mouth, nose, or eyes while taking off the covering or mask.\nWash the cloth face covering or mask after each use.\nConsider carrying a spare cloth face covering or mask. If the cloth face covering or mask becomes wet, visibly soiled, or contaminated at work, it should be removed and stored to be laundered later.\nCloth face coverings or masks should not be worn if their use creates a new risk (for example, if they interfere with driving or vision, or contribute to heat-related illness) that exceeds their COVID-19 related benefits of slowing the spread of the virus. Cloth face coverings or masks should also not be worn by anyone who has trouble breathing or is unable to remove the covering or mask without assistance. CDC provides information on adaptations and alternatives that should be considered when cloth face coverings or masks may not be feasible.\nIf you are concerned about the use of cloth face coverings or masks at your workplace, discuss them with your employer.\nBe aware of contact with frequently touched surfaces.\n\nWash your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You don\u2019t need to wear gloves if you wash your hands regularly (unless they are already required for your job).\n\nUse an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol if soap and water aren\u2019t available.\nWash your hands at these key times:\nBefore, during, and after preparing food\nBefore eating food\nAfter using the toilet\nAfter blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing\nAfter putting on, touching, or removing cloth face coverings or masks\nBefore and after work and work breaks\nAfter touching frequently touched surfaces, such as fareboxes and handrails\n Do not touch your face, mouth, nose, or eyes.\n\nCover your coughs and sneezes.\n\nUse tissues to cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze.\nThrow used tissues in the trash.\nWash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\nHow to Cope with Stress\nMental health is an important part of worker safety and health. The COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges in the ways many people work and connect with others, which may raise feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression.\n\nInformation and resources about mental health, knowing signs of stress, taking steps to manage stress, and knowing where to go if you need help are available on CDC\u2019s How to Cope with Job Stress and Build Resiliance During the COVID-19 Pandemic page.\n\nHow Your Employer Can Protect You\nYour employer should develop a COVID-19 response plan and share it with you.

            "Text": "CDC has developed two laboratory tests that identify SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The newer of these tests also tests for influenza A and B viruses. Testing for all three viruses at the same time will provide public health officials with information they need to help reduce the spread of these viruses in the community while conserving resources that are in short supply.\n\nCDC Influenza SARS-CoV-2 Multiplex Assay\nCDC\u2019s newest laboratory test, detects two types of influenza viruses (A and B) and SARS-CoV-2 at the same time. This test is called the CDC Influenza SARS-CoV-2 (Flu SC2) Multiplex Assay.\n\nA single test that diagnoses current infection with one or more of these viruses will allow public health laboratories to continue influenza surveillance while they are also testing for SARS-CoV-2. Information about both viruses will help public health officials to control the spread of influenza and COVID-19 in the community and may help health care providers manage treatment of influenza and COVID-19. The test will also allow laboratories to conserve important testing materials that are in short supply and process up to three times as many tests as they can with the existing test for SARS CoV-2.\n\nThe Flu SC2 test kit was evaluated in CDC laboratories and three other public health laboratories to ensure that the test works as intended. The Flu SC2 Multiplex Assay was designed using data about SARS-CoV-2 genomes that were not available when the earlier test was designed, which is likely to improve performance of the test.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorizationexternal icon (EUA) for use of the Flu SC2 Multiplex Assay on July 2, 2020. The EUA processexternal icon enables FDA to consider and authorize the use of unapproved but potentially lifesaving medical or diagnostic products during a public health emergency. The U.S Secretary of Health and Human Services declared SARS-CoV-2 to be a U.S. public health emergency on January 31, 2020.\n\nCDC 2019-nCoV RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel In early 2020, CDC developed its first laboratory test kit for use in testing patient specimens for SARS-CoV-2. The test kit is called the CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)\u2013PCR Diagnostic Panel.\n\nOn February 3, 2020, CDC submitted an EUA package to expedite FDA-permitted use of the CDC diagnostic panel in the United States. FDA issued the EUA the next day, and CDC sent the test kits to state and local public health laboratories.\n\nBefore laboratories use a new test on samples from patients, they must verify the test performance (make sure it works as expected) using \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d control materials. The positive control should always test positive, and the negative control should always test negative. During validation of the CDC SARS-CoV-2 test, some laboratories discovered a problem with one of the test\u2019s three reagents\u2014chemicals required to run a test. The reagent produced a positive result with the negative control, so laboratories could not verify test performance.\n\nTo resolve the issue, CDC laboratories determined that this reagent could be left out without affecting test accuracy because of the built-in redundancy in test design. The redundant design saved time by allowing the kits to be used without the reagent. FDA authorized this modification, and new test kits with the two necessary reagents were manufactured and distributed to states. These kits are still in use.\n\nHigh demand for the reagents needed with this test has resulted in global shortages. Some public health laboratories have been unable to get testing reagents to support their testing volumes, resulting in testing delays. Therefore, CDC laboratories validated alternatives for processing the testexternal icon:\n\nFour additional extraction reagents that can be used in the existing extraction methods\nAn additional extraction instrument and associated reagents\nA new process that can be used in place of the extraction method when materials for the current method are limited\nFDA approved these changes on June 12, 2020, in an amendmentexternal icon to the test\u2019s EUA to allow state public health laboratories and others to use these alternatives. Additionally, FDA approved an amendmentexternal icon on July 13, 2020, to add the Promega Maxwell\u00ae RSC 48 as an authorized extraction instrument for use with the CDC 2019-nCoV rRT-PCR Diagnostic Panel.\n\nWho Can Use These Tests?\nCDC tests are provided to U.S. state and local public health laboratories and Department of Defense laboratories that were either previously qualified for being able to perform a similar type of test used to detect influenza or have been recently approved by their state public health laboratory for SARS-CoV-2 testing.",

            "Text": "As some community-based organizations (CBOs) begin to resume or increase their level of activities, CDC offers the following considerations for ways these organizations can help protect individuals and communities and slow the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). CBOs can play a vital role in maintaining community morale and cohesion. They can also serve as a crucial link between communities and local health and other officials, providing insight about the feasibility and acceptability of proposed mitigation strategies and informing authorities about resources and needs in their communities.\n\nCBOs work at the local level to meet community needs. They include social service agencies, nonprofit organizations, and formal and informal community groups, like neighborhood groups or recreational or special-interest clubs. Depending on the nature of their work, a CBO\u2019s stakeholders may include volunteers, members, clients, supporters, patrons, program participants, and event attendees.\n\nThese considerations are meant to supplement\u2014not replace\u2014any state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which organizations must comply. CBOs can determine, in collaboration with state and local health officials, whether and how to implement these considerations, making adjustments to meet the unique needs and circumstances of the local community. CBOs should continually assess, based on current conditions, how to modify their operations and programming to both advance their mission and protect their staff and stakeholders.\n\nCBOs may also benefit from reviewing CDC\u2019s COVID-19 information focused on workplaces, events and gatherings, food service providers, youth sports, youth and summer camps, childcare programs, and people at higher risk of severe illness.\n\nGuiding Principles to Keep in Mind\nThe more people an individual interacts with, and the longer that interaction lasts, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. Location can be a factor, too, with outdoor activities generally being less risky than indoor activities. The risk of COVID-19 spread increases as follows:\n\nLowest risk: Meetings and other activities are conducted virtually. Only essential activities (i.e., provision of essential services) occur in person.\n\nMore risk: Small, in-person gatherings like board meetings or support groups are held. Outdoor activities and meetings are prioritized. Individuals from different households remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and do not share objects. No food is served at meetings or events. Most staff telework and if staff or stakeholders are present in a facility, they are required to wear masks (if able) and maintain social distancing. Rigorous cleaning and disinfecting practices are implemented. Attendees at the organization\u2019s meeting and events come from the same local geographic area (e.g., community, town, city, county).\n\nHigher risk: Indoor activities are held. Medium-sized in-person gatherings are adapted to allow individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart. In CBO facilities, common areas are closed, and staff are encouraged to wear masks (if able) and maintain social distancing. Food is served in pre-packaged boxes with disposable utensils to eliminate the need for shared items or congregating around serving tables. For meetings and events, a limited number of attendees come from outside the local geographic area.\n\nHighest risk: Standard operations and programming are resumed. Large in-person gatherings are held where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart. Food is served \u201cpotluck\u201d or family style. Many event attendees come from outside the local geographic area.\n\nTargeting COVID-19\u2019s Spread\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 is mostly spread by respiratory droplets released when people cough, sneeze, or talk. Someone can also get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own nose, mouth, or possibly their eyes. Therefore, personal prevention practices (such as staying home when sick, social distancing, wearing a mask, and handwashing) and environmental prevention practices (such as cleaning and disinfection) are important ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThese prevention principles are covered in this document. They provide CBOs with actions to help lower the risk of COVID-19 exposure and spread during sponsored activities.\n\nPromoting Healthy Behaviors that Reduce Spread of COVID-19\nCBOs should consider implementing strategies to encourage behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19.\n\nStaying Home when Appropriate \nEducate staff and stakeholders about when they should stay home and when it is safe to gather in person with other people for work or group activities.\nDevelop policies that encourage sick employees to stay at home without fear of reprisal, and ensure employees are aware of these policies.\nActively encourage stakeholders who are sick to stay home.\nStaff and stakeholders should stay home if they have tested positive for or are showing COVID-19 symptoms.\nStaff and stakeholders who have recently had close contact with a person with symptoms of or diagnosed with COVID-19 should also stay home and monitor their health.\nCDC\u2019s criteria can help inform people when it is safe to gather with others:\nIf they have been sick with COVID-19\nIf they tested positive for COVID-19 but had no symptoms\nIf they have recently had a close contact with a person with COVID-19\nHand Hygiene and Respiratory Etiquette \nRequire frequent employee handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and increase monitoring to ensure adherence.\nIf soap and water are not readily available, hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol can be used; rub hands together until dry.\nEncourage staff to cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Used tissues should be thrown in the trash and hands washed immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\nEncourage alternate forms of greeting besides handshakes, hugs, and kissing. For example, introduce a new practice of waving or bowing.\nEncourage clients and others coming to your office or attending events to engage in these same practices.\nMasks  \nRequire the use of masks among staff and volunteers, as feasible. Masks are most essential in times when social distancing is difficult. Information should be provided to all staff and volunteers on proper use, removal, and washing of masks.\nNote: Masks should not be placed on:\nBabies or children younger than 2 years old\nAnyone who has trouble breathing\nAnyone who is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance\nMasks are meant to protect other people in case the wearer may have the virus and not know it. Masks are not meant to be a substitute for personal protective equipment such as surgical masks, respirators, or other medical personal protective equipment.\nEncourage clients and other stakeholders coming to your facility or attending events to bring and use masks.\nAdequate Supplies\nEnsure adequate supplies to support healthy hygienepdf icon behaviors are available for staff, facility visitors, and attendees at all events. Supplies include soap, water, hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, paper towels, tissues, disinfectant wipes, masks (as feasible), and no-touch trash cans.\nSigns and Messages \nPost signs in highly visible locations (e.g., at building entrances, in restrooms) that promote everyday protective measures and describe how to stop the spreadpdf icon of germs by properly washing handsand properly wearing a maskimage icon.\nUse the preferred language(s) of staff and stakeholders for signs and messages.\nConsider developing signs and messages in alternative formats (e.g., large print, Braille, American Sign Language) for people who have low vision or are blind or people who are deaf or hard of hearing.\nAt events, broadcast regular announcements on reducing the spread of COVID-19 on PA system\nInclude messages (for example, videos) about behaviors that prevent spread of COVID-19 when communicating with staff, volunteers, and others who may be in your facility, attend your events, or receive your services.\nFind freely available CDC print and digital resources on CDC\u2019s COVID-19 communications main page.\nTop of Page\nMaintaining Healthy Environments\nCBOs should consider implementing strategies to maintain healthy environments.\n\nCleaning and Disinfection \nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (e.g., door handles, sink handles, drinking fountains, grab bars, hand railings) at least daily or between use as much as possible. Plan for and take these precautions when renting event space and ensure that other groups who may use your facilities take these precautions.\nClean and disinfect shared objects (e.g., microphones, office equipment, payment devices) between each use.\nDevelop a schedule for increased, routine cleaning and disinfection.\nIf transport vehicles (e.g., buses, vans) are used by the CBO staff, drivers and passengers should practice all safety actions and protocols as indicated (e.g., hand hygiene, masksimage icon). To clean and disinfect buses, vans, or other vehicles see guidance for bus transit operators and for drivers for hire and adapt as needed.\nEnsure safe and correct use and storage of cleaners and disinfectants,external icon including storing products securely away from children and ensuring there is adequate ventilation when using these products.\nUse EPA-approved disinfectants against COVID-19pdf icon. Always read and follow label instructions for each product.\nUse disposable gloves when removing garbage bags or handling and disposing of trash:\nAfter using disposable gloves, throw them out in a lined trash can.\nDo not disinfect or reuse the gloves.\nWash hands after removing gloves.\nRestrooms\nConsider limiting the number of people that use the restroom at one time to allow for social distancing.\nIf lines form near the restroom, ensure people remain at least 6 feet from each other.\nEnsure that restrooms are:\nCleaned and disinfected regularly, particularly high-touch surfaces such as faucets, toilets, doorknobs, and light switches. Clean and disinfect restrooms daily or more often, if possible, and use EPA-approved disinfectants against COVID-19pdf icon.\nRegularly stocked with supplies for handwashing, including soap, water, and disposable paper towels or hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Avoid supplying reusable towels.\nEnsure safe and correct application of disinfectants and keep products away from children.\nVentilation \nEnsure ventilation systems operate properly and increase circulation of outdoor air as much as possible, for example by opening windows and doors. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk (e.g., risk of falling or triggering asthma symptoms).\nWater Systems\nTo minimize the risk of Legionnaires\u2019 disease and other diseases associated with stagnant water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (e.g., sink faucets, drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown. Drinking fountains should be cleaned and sanitized, but encourage people working in or visiting your facility to bring their own water, as feasible, to minimize use and touching of water fountains.\nPhysical Barriers and Guides \nProvide physical guides (e.g., guides for creating \u201cone-way routes\u201d), such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls, to ensure that individuals remain at least 6 feet apart in lines and at other times.\nInstall physical barriers, such as sneeze guards and partitions, particularly in areas where it is difficult for individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart. Barriers can be useful at reception areas, distribution counters, and other areas where remaining at least 6 feet apart is difficult.\nCommunal Spaces \nUse methods to physically separate employees in all areas of the facilities including work areas and other areas such as meeting rooms, break rooms, parking lots, entrance and exit areas, and locker rooms; otherwise, stagger use and clean and disinfect between use.\nArrange reception or other communal seating area chairs by turning, draping (covering chair with tape or fabric so seats cannot be used), spacing, or removing chairs to maintain social distancing.\nFood Service\nThere is no evidence that people can get COVID-19 from eating food. However, sharing utensils and congregating around food service areas may present risks.\nIf food is offered at any meeting or event, have individual, pre-packaged boxes or bags instead of a potluck, buffet, or family-style meal. Avoid sharing of foods and utensils.\nIf the organization hosts an event that includes food service, refer to CDC\u2019s COVID-19 considerations for restaurants and bars.\nProvide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls, to ensure that individuals not from the same household remain at least 6 feet apart when waiting in line to order or pick up.\nUse disposable food service items (e.g., utensils, dishes). If disposable items are not feasible or desirable, ensure that all non-disposable food service items are handled with gloves and washed with dish soap and hot water or in a dishwasher. Individuals should wash their hands after removing their gloves or after directly handling used food service items.\nShared Objects \nDiscourage people from sharing items that are difficult to clean, sanitize, or disinfect in between use, such as food containers, tools, equipment, or supplies.\nEnsure adequate supplies to minimize sharing of high-touch materials to the extent possible; otherwise, limit use of supplies and equipment to one group of people at a time and clean and disinfect between use.\nTop of Page\nMaintaining Healthy Operations\nCBOs should consider implementing strategies to maintain healthy operations.\n\nRegulatory Awareness\nBe aware of local or state regulatory agency policies related to group gatherings to determine if events can be held.\nParticipation in Community Response Efforts\nConsider participating with local authorities in broader COVID-19 community response efforts (e.g., sitting on community response committees) and collaborating with other CBOs to coordinate activities or limit duplication of efforts, where possible.\nInform local authorities about areas of concern or previously unknown issues as well as community or organizational resources that might be helpful in responding to changing circumstances in the community.\nFlexible and Responsive Operations and Communication Plans\nDefine roles, responsibilities, and decision-making protocols so that the organization can adjust operations, services, and programming in response to changing community conditions.\nDevelop a communication plan to alert stakeholders to changes in operations and ensure that contact information is up to date.\nDevelop information-sharing systems with partners, including local health officials.\nDesignated COVID-19 Point of Contact\nDesignate a staff person to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns. All staff and stakeholders should know who this person is and how to contact them.\nProtections for Staff and Others who are at Higher Risk of Severe Illness from COVID-19\nOffer options that limit exposure risk (e.g., telework, modified job responsibilities) for staff at higher risk for severe illness (including older adults and people of all ages with certain underlying medical conditions).\nAs feasible, offer options that limit the COVID-19 exposure risk (e.g., virtual attendance) for stakeholders who are at higher risk for severe illness. Replace in-person meetings with video- or tele-conference calls whenever possible.\nLimit event attendance to staff and attendees who live in the local geographic area (e.g., community, city, town, county) to reduce risk of spread from areas with higher levels of COVID-19.\nPut in place policies that protect the privacy of people at higher risk for severe illness regarding their underlying medical conditions.\nSocial Distancing and Modifying Layouts \nReconfigure office spaces, waiting or meeting rooms, break rooms, conference rooms, or similar areas to allow for at least 6 feet between people.\nIn situations where people will form lines, encourage people to stay at least 6 feet apart by providing signs or other visual cues such as tape or chalk marks.\nLimit attendance at events to allow for social distancing, or host smaller events in larger rooms.\nPrioritize outdoor activities where attendees can remain at least 6 feet from others not living in their household.\nIf distributing items like food or supplies, consider using drive-up distribution so that people can maintain distance from each other and to eliminate the need to touch doorknobs and other items and surfaces in a facility.\nConsider temporarily suspending singing, chanting, or shouting during events especially when participants are in close proximity to each other. If attendees choose to sing, chant, or shout, encourage them to wear masks and increase distance between people to greater than 6 feet.\nMeetings, Gatherings, and Performances\nPursue virtual group events, gatherings, or meetings, if possible, and promote social distancing of at least 6 feet between people if in-person events are held. Limit group size to the extent possible.\nPrioritize outdoor activities where attendees can remain at least 6 feet from others not living in their household.\nWhen planning events, consult CDC\u2019s Considerations for Gatherings and Community Events.\nLimit any nonessential visitors, spectators, and volunteers at events.\nLimit activities involving external groups or organizations as much as possible \u2013 especially with individuals not from the local geographic area (e.g., community, town, city, or county).\nConsider temporarily suspending musical performances that involve singing or playing wind instruments. If such events are held, musicians should be spaced as far apart as feasible, ideally farther than 6 feet apart.\nChildcare and Youth Programming\nIf providing a nursery or childcare during meetings or events, refer to CDC\u2019s information on preventing the spread of COVID-19 in childcare settings.\nIf holding summer day camps, refer to CDC\u2019s information on youth and summer camps.\nIdentifying Small Groups and Keeping Them Together (Cohorting)\nEnsure that groupings of staff, volunteers, and program participants are as small and as static as possible. CBOs should consider:\nScheduling staff and volunteers together in small groups (cohorts) so that they are always scheduled to work on the same days/times together, reducing their exposure risk.\nEnsuring attendees of regular events (e.g., support groups) are scheduled with the same group of attendees for each event so that individuals are in contact with the same people for each visit, and so that distinct groupings do not mix.\nLimit use of supplies and equipment to one group of people at a time and clean and disinfect between use.\nStaggered Scheduling\nStagger arrival times or locations for meetings and events.\nUse flexible worksites (e.g., telework) and flexible work hours (e.g., staggered shifts) to help establish policies and practices for social distancing of at least 6 feet between employees, volunteers, and others.\nTransportation\nFor employees who commute to work using public transportation or ride sharing, encourage them to use transportation options that minimize close contact with others (e.g., walking or biking, driving or riding by car \u2013 alone or with household members only) or consider offering the following support:\nAsk employees to follow the CDC guidance on how to Protect Yourself When Using Transportation, including public transit.\nAllow employees to shift their hours so they can commute during less busy times.\nAsk employees to maintain social distance when possible, wear a mask if able, and wash their hands as soon as possible when they arrive to work.\nWhere possible, avoid activities that require shared transportation vehicles.\nIf using shared transportation vehicles like vans or buses, clean and disinfect them according to the guidance for bus transit operators or drivers for hire. Ensure that drivers and passengers wear masks, if they are able; remain about 6 feet apart, as feasible; and wash their hands as soon as possible after the trip.\nCommunication Systems\nPut systems in place to:\nEncourage staff and stakeholders who come to your facility or attend events sponsored by your organization to self-report to the designated COVID-19 point of contact if they have symptoms of COVID-19, a positive test for COVID-19, or were exposed to someone with COVID-19 within the last 14 days in accordance with health information sharing regulations for COVID-19external icon (e.g., see \u201cNotify Health Officials and Close Contacts\u201d in the Preparing for When Someone Gets Sick section below), and other applicable privacy and confidentiality laws and regulations.\nNotify staff and stakeholders of cancellations and restrictions in place to limit exposure to COVID-19 (e.g., limited hours of operation).\nIdentify and address potential language, cultural, and environmental barriers associated with communicating COVID-19 information to organization staff and stakeholders. Tailor information so that it is easily understood by various audiences and is available in a variety of languages and formats.\nLearn more about reaching people of diverse languages and cultures by visiting: Know Your Audience. You can also, learn more about communicating to staff in a crisis at Crisis Communications.\nLeave (Time Off) Policies\nImplement flexible sick leave policies and practices that are not punitive and that enable employees to stay home when they are sick, have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, are caring for someone who is sick, or who must stay home with children if schools or childcare centers are closed.\nExamine and revise policies for leave, telework, and employee compensation as needed.\nEnsure employees are aware of these policies.\nBack-Up Staffing Plan\nMonitor absenteeism of employees and critical volunteers, cross-train staff and volunteers, and create a roster of trained back-up staff and volunteers.\nDevelop policies for employees and volunteers to return to their duties and the facility after having COVID-19. CDC\u2019s criteria to discontinue home isolation and quarantine can inform these policies.\nStaff Training\nTrain staff on all safety protocols. Use CDC\u2019s Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers as a guide.\nConduct training virtually or ensure that participants maintain social distancing during training.\nAs volunteers often perform important duties, consider similar monitoring, planning, and training for them.\nConsider that volunteer and staffing levels may need to increase to implement cleaning and safety protocols.\nClose Contact\nCBO staff or volunteers who have close contact (within 6 feet) with clients (e.g., people who visit client homes) should take extra precautions. CBOs should consult with local public health officials and occupational safety and health professionals to decide whether staff or volunteers should wear any form of personal protective equipment rather than or in addition to a mask. Masks are meant to protect other people in case the wearer is unknowingly infected but does not have symptoms. Masks are not meant to be a substitute for personal protective equipment such as surgical masks, respirators, or other medical personal protective equipment.\nLimit the amount of time staff or volunteers are in close contact (within 6 feet) with others, to the extent feasible.\nMaintain a supply of masks for clients to wear (if able) and provide guidance on how to wear them properly.\nRemind clients to cover their mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing. Used tissues should be thrown in the trash and hands washed immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\nProper hand hygiene is an important infection control measure. Ensure employees and volunteers wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

            "HeadLine": "Implementing Filtering Facepiece Respirator (FFR) Reuse, Including Reuse after Decontamination, When There Are Known Shortages of N95 Respirators",
            "Text": "CDC\u2019s Strategies for Optimizing the Supply of N95 FFRs were written to follow a continuum using the surge capacity approach in the order of conventional (everyday practice), contingency (expected shortages), and crisis (known shortages) capacities. N95 FFRs are meant to be disposed after each use. CDC developed contingency and crisis strategies to help healthcare facilities conserve their supplies in the face of shortages.\n\nWhen the availability of N95 FFRs become limited due to an expected shortage, supplies first should be conserved using contingency strategies.\n\nContingency Strategies\nWith extended use, N95 FFRs are worn for a prolonged period, for multiple patient contacts, before being removed and discarded (unlike conventional strategies in which an N95 FFR is used for one patient contact then discarded). This will slow the N95 FFR burn rate to help alleviate supply concerns.\nN95 FFRs are used beyond the manufacturer designated shelf-life for fit testing and training.\nAfter attempting the above contingency strategies and there is still a known shortage of N95 FFRs and available supplies cannot meet needs based on the current burn rate, crisis capacity strategies can be used.\n\nCrisis Capacity Strategies\nRespirators (including N95 FFRs and other types of respirators) are used beyond the manufacturer-designated shelf life for health care delivery.\nRespirators are used that are similar to NIOSH-approved respirators but are not NIOSH approved and are approved according to standards used in other countries. The performance of some internationally approved respirators was evaluated by NIOSH and the results can be found here.\nRespirators are used that have reached the manufacturer-designated shelf life but have not been evaluated by NIOSH.\nWith limited reuse, an N95 FFRs is donned for one patient contact, then doffed and stored before being used for another patient contact for a limited number of donnings.\nThe use of N95 FFRs and facemasks is prioritized by healthcare activity type.\nThis guidance provides information on how to determine if, and when, a healthcare facility should be operating under N95 FFR crisis capacity situations during the COVID-19 pandemic and how to appropriately implement limited reuse of N95 FFRs, including their reuse after decontamination.\n\nHow to determine if an N95 FFR crisis capacity strategy is needed\nBecause crisis capacity strategies are not compatible with US standards of care, crisis capacity strategies should only be implemented when there are known shortages of N95 FFRs and only after conventional and contingency strategies have been implemented.\n\nThe ability to implement specific crisis capacity strategies will depend on the on-hand inventory. The following flow chart can assist healthcare facility respiratory program managers in determining if their healthcare facility should operate under a crisis capacity situation.  Use the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Burn Rate Calculator to help you plan and optimize the use of PPE.\n\nFlowchart to Determine if an N95 FFR Crisis Capacity Strategy Is Needed\nEvaluate Adequacy of Current N95 FFR Inventory and Supply Chain\n\nIs your current N95 FFR inventory and supply chain equal to or greater than your PPE needs?\n\nAre there N95 FFRs available from local healthcare coalitions and federal, state, and local public health partners (e.g., public health emergency preparedness and response staff) that can cover your PPE needs based on your burn rate and ability to procure more PPE when needed?\n\nUse the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Burn Rate Calculator, available here, to help you plan and optimize the use of PPE during the response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\nEvaluate Availability of Other Respirators in Your Inventory\n\nAre there NIOSH-approved respirators that meet or exceed the level of protection of N95 FFRs available in your inventory or from the supply chain to cover your PPE needs?\n\nAre there NIOSH-approved respirators available from local healthcare coalitions and federal, state, and local public health partners (e.g., public health emergency preparedness and response staff) that can cover your PPE needs?\n\nOther devices that can be used include N99, N100, P95, P99, P100, R95, R99, and R100 FFRs, elastomeric respirators, and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs).\n\nThe use of these devices is included in the conventional capacity strategies to conserve the supply of N95 FFRs.  More information on other NIOSH-approved respiratory protective devices can be found here.\n\nEvaluate Extended Use of N95 FFRs\n\nCan extended use of N95 FFRs (using the same N95 FFR for more than one patient contact) cover your PPE needs based on your burn rate and ability to procure more PPE when needed?\n\nMore information on extended FFR use and other contingency capacity strategies can be found here. What is limited FFR reuse?\nLimited FFR reuse refers to the practice of using the same N95 FFR or other filtering facepiece respirator for multiple encounters with patients but removing it (doffing) after each encounter [1]. This is different than extended use of an FFR where the same FFR is worn continuously for encounters with multiple patients. During limited reuse, the FFR is stored in between encounters to be put on again (donned) prior to the next encounter with a patient. Decontamination of N95 FFRs may be considered as part of limited reuse strategies. Extended use may also be considered as part of limited reuse strategies whereby an N95 FFR is worn for multiple patient contacts then stored or decontaminated before being reused. More information on implementing reuse and extended use can be found here.\n\nThe number of times that an FFR can be reused is limited by:\n\nFit\nFiltration performance\nContamination and soiling\nDamage\nFFRs visibly contaminated with blood, respiratory or nasal secretions, or other bodily fluids should be discarded and not reused. FFRs that are damaged (e.g. broken straps, broken nose piece), malformed, or are unable to pass a fit check should also be discarded and not reused.\n\nMore information on limited FFR reuse can be found here.\n\nWhen should limited reuse be implemented?\nLimited FFR reuse is just one of several strategies available for addressing an N95 FFR crisis capacity situation when there is a known shortage of devices after conventional and contingency capacity strategies have been implemented. It should only be considered during a crisis capacity situation during a declared public health emergency. When an N95 FFR crisis situation no longer exists, limited FFR reuse should not be utilized.\n\nBefore deciding to implement FFR reuse, facilities should explore opportunities to switch to respirators that are designed to be decontaminated and reused (e.g., elastomeric respirators or powered air-purifying respirators) to reduce demand for FFRs and the need for crisis capacity strategies.\n\nLimitations for Limited FFR reuse\nDecrease in N95 FFR fit and filtration performance\nNIOSH-certified N95 FFRs are designed to filter 95% of particles when appropriately fitted to the wearer\u2019s face. This means that an N95 that is not properly fitted to the face will likely give the wearer less protection. N95 FFRs are designed to be single-use devices but may be used multiple times under crisis capacity strategies. N95 FFR performance will decrease as the number of hours and number of donnings and doffings increase.\n\nThe number of times that an FFR can be reused will likely be limited by its fit because the tethering straps can become weaker or stretched after each donning. Each time an N95 FFR is donned or doffed, the integrity of the straps may be impacted. Repeated donning and doffing will result in the straps no longer being able to generate enough force to create a tight seal with the face. The resulting poor seal will allow unfiltered air to enter the N95 FFR and into the wearer\u2019s breathing zone.\n\nCDC recommends limiting the number of donnings for an N95 FFR to no more than five per device. It may be possible to don some models of FFRs more than five times [2]. One study reported that fit performance decreased over multiple, consecutive donnings and fit varied among the different models of FFRs examined [3]. If manufacturer guidance on how many times a particular FFR can be donned is not available, the CDC recommends limiting the number of uses to no more than five per device based on published data on changes in FFR fit from a limited number of FFR models over multiple donnings.\n\nA recent observational study conducted in a hospital emergency room during the COVID-19 pandemic found that extended use and reuse of N95 FFRs as measured by the total hours and shifts the mask was worn and the number of donnings and doffings was associated with an increase in the fit failure of the respirators. This study also showed that it may be possible to don some models of FFRs more than five times [2]. Fit performance during limited reuse should be monitored by the respiratory protection program manager or appropriate safety personnel. Information about how to assess N95 FFR fit during limited reuse can be found below. More information on limited FFR reuse can be found here.\n\nN95 FFR contamination and self-contamination risk\nFFRs, which are typically made of multiple layers of materials, can become contaminated while filtering the inhaled air of the wearer during exposures to pathogen-laden aerosols. Studies [4-6] have shown that:\n\nThe outer layer of the FFR, which is the layer furthest from the wearer\u2019s face, can become contaminated when exposed to virus aerosols.\nThe inner layer of the FFR, which is the closet to the wearer\u2019s face, is unlikely to be contaminated.\nThe electret filtering layer, which is found between the inner and outer layers of the FFR, captures most of the aerosolized virus particles.\n\n\nPathogens captured by the FFR\u2019s electret filtering layer are not readily dislodged due to the attractive forces between the particles and the electret filtering media [7]. Physical contact with the filtering layer by the wearer is unlikely due to its location within the FFR. The outer surface, the surface furthest from the wearer\u2019s face, presents the highest risk for pathogen transfer to the wearer. Wearers should practice hand hygiene before and after handling any FFR to avoid potentially contaminating the outside layer of the FFR with their hands.\n\nWearers of new or reused FFRs should be careful to avoid contaminating them when:\n\nDonning and doffing the FFR\nAdjusting the fit or placement of the FFR\nPerforming a user-seal check when redonning a previously worn FFR\nA limited reuse strategy to reduce the risk of self-contamination\nOne strategy to reduce the risk of contact transfer of pathogens from the FFR to the wearer during FFR reuse is to issue five N95 FFRs to each healthcare staff member who care for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. The healthcare staff member can wear one N95 FFR each day and store it in a breathable paper bag at the end of each shift with a minimum of five days between each N95 FFR use, rotating the use each day between N95 FFRs. This will provide some time for pathogens on it to \u201cdie off\u201d during storage [8]. This strategy requires a minimum of five N95 FFRs per staff member, provided that healthcare personnel don, doff, and store them properly each day.\n\nAs a caution, healthcare personnel should treat reused FFRs as though they are contaminated, while preventing FFR contamination prior to donning by following the precautions outlined in the reuse recommendations found here. Hand hygiene with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol should be performed before donning and after touching or adjusting the FFR while in use (if necessary for comfort or to maintain fit) or after doffing. More information about ways to minimize the risks of FFR reuse can be found here.\n\nCDC recommends limiting the number of donnings for an N95 FFR to no more than five per device. It may be possible to don some models of FFRs more than five times [2]. Fit performance during limited reuse should be monitored by the respiratory protection program manager or appropriate safety personnel. Information about how to assess N95 FFR fit during limited reuse can be found below.\n\nIf supplies are even more constrained, and five respirators are not available for each worker who needs them, N95 FFR limited reuse with FFR decontamination may be necessary.\n\nWhat is FFR decontamination?\nDecontamination is a process to reduce the number of pathogens on used FFRs before reusing them. It is used to limit the risk of self-contamination. Decontamination and subsequent reuse of FFRs should only be practiced where FFR shortages exist. Decontamination should only be performed on NIOSH-approved FFRs without exhalation valves.\n\nAt present, FFRs are considered one-time use products, and there are currently no manufacturer-authorized methods for FFR decontamination before reuse. Only respirator manufacturers can reliably provide guidance on how to decontaminate their specific models of FFRs. In the absence of manufacturer\u2019s recommendations, third parties, such as decontamination companies, safety organizations, or research laboratories, may also provide guidance or procedures on how to decontaminate respirators without impacting their performance.\n\nAn effective FFR decontamination method should reduce the pathogen burden, not harm the fit or filtration performance of the FFR, and should present no residual chemical hazard. NIOSH reviewed the literature on decontaminating FFRs because of these considerations. NIOSH found that, as of April 2020, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, vaporous hydrogen peroxide, and moist heat have shown the most promise as potential methods to decontaminate FFRs.\n\nOn March 29, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued the first Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for a process to decontaminate, and subsequent EUAs have been issued. Healthcare facilities should check the FDA Emergency Use Authorizations websiteexternal icon for the most up-to-date information.\n\nThe effectiveness of using any of the methods mentioned in this guidance should be explored with specific FFR models and with the manufacturer and, if needed, third party expert input and support to better understand the impact on respirator performance, including filtration and fit, and structural integrity, including integrity of head straps and other parts.\n\nEmployers should be able to demonstrate effectiveness of any decontamination methods used against the likely contaminants (i.e., pathogens) of concern including SARS-CoV-2. Employers should also ensure that any decontamination methods used, including those for which an FDA EUA has been issued, do not produce additional safety hazards (e.g., electrical arcs resulting from placing FFRs with metal parts into microwaves), or that workers are adequately protected from those hazards through appropriate engineering and administrative controls, safe work practices, and personal protective equipment.\n\nDecontamination might cause poorer fit, reduced filtration efficiency, and reduced breathability of disposable FFRs as a result of changes to the filtering material, straps, nose bridge material, or strap attachments of the FFR. Decontamination may produce chemical inhalation risks and should be evaluated for off-gassing.\n\nWhile decontamination and subsequent reuse of FFRs void the NIOSH approval and are not permitted under OSHA\u2019s respiratory protection standard during normal conditions of use, these options may need to be considered during a crisis capacity situation when FFR shortages exist.\n\nConsiderations before deciding to decontaminate FFRs\nFFR Decontamination is one strategy available during an N95 FFR crisis capacity situation\nOther strategies to conserve supplies of respirators during an N95 FFR crisis capacity situation should be utilized first before FFR decontamination is implemented. Other crisis capacity strategies to conserve supplies of respirators can be found here.\n\nUse respirators identified by CDC as performing adequately for healthcare delivery when beyond their manufacturer-designated shelf life.\nUsing respirators that are similar to NIOSH-approved respirators and not NIOSH approved but that are approved according to standards used in other countries.\nImplement limited reuse of N95 FFRs by one healthcare staff member for multiple encounters with different patients, but have the staff member remove it after each encounter.\nPrioritize the use of N95 FFRs and facemasks by activity type with and without masking symptomatic patients.\nN95 FFR decontamination will not increase the number of times or hours that an FFR can be worn\nDecontamination of an N95 FFR inactivates viruses and bacteria on the device, but does not restore the N95 FFR to \u201cnew\u201d performance. Decontamination studies have evaluated the effect of the decontamination process on the fit and filtration performance of N95 FFRs; however, these studies did not consider the likelihood that N95 FFRs worn by healthcare personnel are likely donned and doffed multiple times before undergoing decontamination. N95 FFR performance will decrease as the number of hours and number of donnings and doffings increase. Repeated decontamination and handling of FFRs can damage the fit and filtration performance of N95 FFRs. Fit performance during limited reuse, including decontaminated FFRs, should be monitored by the respiratory protection program manager or appropriate safety personnel. Information about how to assess N95 FFR fit during limited reuse can be found below.\n\nThe effects of N95 FFR decontamination may vary by model\nOnly respirator manufacturers can reliably provide guidance on how to decontaminate their specific FFR models. In the absence of manufacturer\u2019s recommendations, third parties may also provide guidance or procedures on how to decontaminate respirators without impacting respirator performance.\n\nDecontamination methods should be evaluated for each FFR model currently being used under a facility\u2019s respiratory protection program. The method should be evaluated, or data should be made available from third party decontaminators, that demonstrate:\n\nThe method can inactivate viruses and bacteria.\nFiltration performance is not affected after each cycle of decontamination.\nFit performance of the respirator is not affected after each decontamination cycle.\nOff-gassing of decontamination chemicals falls below the permissible range.\nNIOSH has evaluated the filtration and fit performance for some models of N95 FFRs using a variety of decontamination methods. These assessments were made on new, unused respirators that had been decontaminated and did not include the efficacy of the method for inactivating viruses or bacteria. Results of these assessments are available here.\n\nDecontaminated FFRs should be monitored and tracked\nThere are approximately 500 NIOSH-certified N95 FFR models, and each one has its individual set of construction materials and characteristics, including surface area and \u201cdead space.\u201d It is important to check with the manufacturer to make sure the respirator used has been evaluated to determine if the decontamination method is appropriate: Just because a method is effective for one respirator does not mean it will be effective for a different respirator.\n\n\n\nHealthcare facilities using multiple FFR models should develop a process to ensure appropriate decontamination methods are used for their current FFR models. This process should include several pieces of data related to the decontamination process, FFR use, and tracking of any adverse reactions such as skin irritations, headaches, and respiratory distress. This process should include:\n\nA listing of current FFR models in use and the ability of each model to be decontaminated using the current decontamination method\nThe number of FFRs available and a plan for decontamination that will not result in additional shortages\nThe number of cycles each FFR has been decontaminated\nCollection of data related to any adverse effects such as skin irritation, smells or off-gassing, physiological complaints such as headaches or respiratory distress, etc.\nSampling decontaminated respirators to measure filtration efficiency and fit performance\nFrequent evaluation of fit performance of decontaminated FFRs\nAll employees should receive proper training on how to reuse FFRs including how to decontaminate FFRs if implemented\nFacilities should provide healthcare personnel with required education and training, including having them demonstrate competency when donning and doffing, with any PPE ensemble that is used to perform job responsibilities, such as provision of patient care. Employees should be properly trained to reuse FFRs and use decontaminated FFRs. Training should address the following:\n\nThe risks of self-contamination during reuse\nLimitations of decontaminated FFRs\nHow to properly store and label FFRs\nHow to properly don and doff FFRs\nWhen to discard FFRs\nHow to perform a user seal check\nMore information on how to reuse FFRs can be found here.\n\nHow to assess the performance of reused FFRs including decontaminated FFRs\nFFR wearers should perform a user seal check each time they don an FFR. More information about conducting a user seal check can be found here and may be included with the user instructions provided by the manufacturer. For FFRs that have been donned more than 5 times, FFR program managers should consider implementing a qualitative FFR fit performance evaluation. A qualitative FFR fit performance evaluation is not the same as a qualitative fit test, but can be conducted using the same agents and exercises used for qualitative fit testing. A qualitative FFR fit performance evaluation is an abbreviated evaluation where each exercise is conducted for 15 seconds [9]. If the wearer detects the test agent while performing these exercises, the fit of the reused FFR may be compromised. When the availability of pre-made fit test solutions are limited, many can be prepared using commercially available chemicals following the instructions here.\n\nA qualitative FFR performance evaluation is conducted as follows:\n\nThe FFR wearer should don their previously used FFR (for reuse) or be wearing an FFR (extended use).\nThe wearer dons the test hood.\nThe test agent is released within the hood (add more test agent every 30 seconds).\nThe wearer performs 7 exercises for 15 seconds each:\nBreathe normally\nBreathe deeply\nMove head side to side\nMove head up and down\nTalk\nBend over at the waist\nBreathe normally\nWhen to stop using crisis capacity strategies and return to normal operations\nAs soon as new supplies can meet the projected demand, all reuse and decontamination of respirators should be discontinued. FFRs should only be reused when operating at crisis capacity due to the inability of FFR supplies to meet the burn rate. Current rates of usage and FFR availability should be monitored daily. Additionally, supply chain options should be checked regularly to determine if more FFRs or other suitable forms of respiratory protection can be acquired. Other devices that can be used include N99, N100, P95, P99, P100, R95, R99, and R100 FFRs, elastomeric respirators, and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs). The use of these devices is included in the conventional capacity strategies to conserve the supply of N95 FFRs. More information on the use of other NIOSH-approved respiratory devices can be found here. FFR decontamination should only be implemented as a crisis capacity strategy during a declared public health emergency and should not be practiced when other devices are available or there are enough N95 FFRs to exit crisis capacity strategies. Facilities wishing to incorporate respirators that can be decontaminated and reused into their long-term strategy should consider using reusable respirators such as elastomeric respirators or PAPRs.",

Quick and coordinated actions, including case investigation and contact tracing, may lower the need for business closures to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\nEmployers\u2019 involvement with the official health department case investigation or contact tracing process may vary. It will depend on the authorities, responsibilities, and capacities of their health departments; federal, state, and local laws and regulations; and the level of interest and capacity of the employer. Employers may consult with their company\u2019s human resources, legal, medical, and occupational safety and health guidance, policy and other resources to help them develop and implement their COVID-19 preparedness, response, and control plan.\n\nCDC\u2019s Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Businesses and Workplaces webpage provides information to help businesses limit the spread of COVID-19 within the workplace. This document provides tips and considerations for how employers can partner with state, tribal, local, or territorial (STLT) health departments and work with their employees in these COVID-19 response efforts.\n\nWhat employers should know about COVID-19 case investigation and contact tracing\nCOVID-19 is a nationally notifiable diseaseexternal icon, and when diagnosed or identified, must be reported by healthcare providers and laboratories to STLT health departments. Health departments are responsible for leading case investigations, contact tracing, and outbreak investigations. Case investigation is the identification and investigation of individuals with confirmed and probable diagnoses of a reportable communicable disease, such as COVID-19. Contact tracing follows case investigation and is a process to identify, monitor, and support individuals who may have been exposed to a person with a communicable disease, such as COVID-19. Health departments also administer communicable disease control measures within their jurisdictions to protect public health. This includes working with patients and contacts on isolation (separation of people infected with the virus from people who are not infected) and quarantine (separation of people who might have been exposed to COVID-19 from others). Given the large number of COVID-19 cases reported to health departments, coupled with how easily and quickly the virus is spreading, health department resources can be overwhelmed. When requested by the health department, employer assistance may aid in limiting the spread of the COVID-19 in the work environment.\n\nEmployer involvement\nWhen health department personnel investigate a case, they will ask the patient questions about work status and work environment, about persons they have been in close contact with, and locations visited during the time they could have spread COVID-19 to others. If the health department learns a person is a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19 and was in a workplace where close contact with others (employees, customers, or community members) may have occurred, the health department may contact the employer, employees, or customers to let them know of potential exposures. Confidential information about the infected individual, including their name and other personal identifying information, will be safeguarded and not be revealed without their permission. Employers can assist the health department by providing further identification of potential contacts who worked in the same area and on the same shift, hosting a site visit for health department personnel to observe the workplace in order to make workplace-operation recommendations to help prevent further spread of the virus, and facilitating communication with employees.\n\nThe level of interaction between the health department and an employer will vary depending on several factors, such as the size and type of workplace, the number of cases impacting the workplace, the health department\u2019s capacity, and local, state, and federal laws and regulations.\n\nIn general, when a COVID-19 case is identified that impacts a workplace, the health department may ask the employer for help in a number of ways, including:\n\nAsk the employer for help in understanding the risk for transmission in the workplace and identifying exposures and contacts in the workplace. This may include health department-initiated interviews, site visits, and record reviews to identify close contacts who may have been exposed to the virus better understand risks for transmission within the workplace (e.g., barriers to social distancing or use of cloth face coverings).\nRely on the employer to identify workplace contacts. While this is not typical, some health departments have or may initiate agreements with employers with occupational health or medical programs or trained occupational safety and health staff who are able to formally and confidentially carry out some aspects of contact tracing in the workplace. In such situations, to protect employees\u2019 privacy, health departments will take responsibility for case investigation and contact tracing outside of the workplace. If employers are interested in this type of agreement, they should contact their health department in advance to discuss the possibility and details of this option.\nConduct workplace contact tracing without directly engaging the employer. The health department may decide they do not need assistance or information from the employer because the risk of further workplace transmission is low. Another reason is the health department may not have the resources to follow up with the employer. They also may not be permitted to involve an employer because local or state privacy laws may limit third-party involvement in contact tracing without the case patient\u2019s consent.\nPreparing to collaborate with the health department\nWhat employers can do to assist in the response to COVID-19:\n\nEstablish a COVID-19 coordinator or team. Employers may find it useful to identify a coordinator or a team to oversee COVID-19 related activities. The COVID-19 coordinator/team should serve as a resource to the health department and the workplace as the primary point of contact for coordinating all COVID-19 activities. The COVID-19 coordinator/team should help to develop and put into action the hazard assessment activities discussed below.\nThe COVID-19 coordinator/team can review CDC\u2019s Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Contact Tracing guidance to better prepare and understand these processes. The COVID-19 coordinator/team can also visit the STLT health department website to see if specific local information for employers is available. Some jurisdictions have state-based occupational health and safety surveillance programs that may be able to assist.\nWhile the employer\u2019s COVID-19 coordinator/team can aid the health department when requested to carry out some contact tracing activities among their employees, they do not have the authorities to perform all aspects of these functions without consultation with the health department. For instance, employers can limit entry into the workplace by employees based on the employer\u2019s fitness-for-duty policies, but employers cannot ask about workers\u2019 activities or contacts outside of work.\nCreate and implement a preparedness, response, and control plan. Employers can use the guidance from CDC\u2019s Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Businesses and Workplaces web page to create a COVID-19 preparedness, response, and control plan. Making this plan will help employers evaluate the risk and decide on actions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. Having the plan will also allow employers to rapidly gather employee and workplace records, when needed, to assist possible health department-initiated case investigations and contact tracing. The employer may also decide to distribute this plan throughout their business.\nCollect information about the workplace. One of the most useful things an employer can do is to prepare and quickly provide information and records to the health department about the workplace, potential workplace contacts, and, when needed, workplace operations, without revealing confidential personnel records or business information. Examples of useful information to have on hand can be found in the Interim Customizable Non-Healthcare Workplace Infection Control Assessment and Response (WICAR) tool \u2014 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\nNote that all activities and information collected by an employer should be limited to the work setting and be consistent with applicable local, state, and federal privacy, health/medical, and workplace laws and regulations (e.g., U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)external iconand Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)external icon).\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s (OSHA) interim guidanceexternal icon outlines employer requirements with respect to the recording of occupational illnesses, specifically cases of COVID-19. Under OSHA\u2019s recordkeeping requirements, COVID-19 is a recordable illness, and thus employers are responsible for recording cases of COVID-19, if the case meets certain requirements. Employers are encouraged to frequently check OSHA\u2019s COVID-19 webpageexternal icon for updates.\nSupport employees and conduct workplace hazard evaluation and prevention activities. As noted in the CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers Responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), May 2020, employers must provide a safe and healthy workplaceexternal icon free from known hazards that are likely to cause death or serious physical harm. If an employee, customer, or a visitor in the workplace has symptoms consistent with COVID-19, self-reports a COVID-19 diagnosis, or close contact with someone with confirmed or probable COVID-19, an employer should quickly take action by conducting workplace hazard evaluation and prevention activities. These actions will help limit the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace.\nCOVID-19 is a new hazard in the workplace, employers should also consider carrying out relevant hazard assessmentexternal icon that can help identify potential hazards related to COVID-19. Employers should then use proper hierarchy of controls methods to limit the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace setting.\nCommunicate with employees. Employers should inform employees that the health department will contact persons diagnosed with COVID-19 or those in close contact with someone testing positive for COVID-19. Employers should encourage employees to work with the health department to discuss their illness, exposures, and contacts so the health department can limit further spread of COVID-19.\nIf employers are notified of a case of or exposure to COVID-19, they must adhere to workplace and medical privacy laws and protections. Employers should also tell employees that when the health department notifies people who were exposed in the workplace (contacts), they will only share that they may have been exposed to COVID-19; they will not share names or any personal or medical information of the case with contacts. The health department will offer recommendations for testing and quarantine based on that exposure.",

            "Text": "It\u2019s hard enough to fight COVID-19 when it\u2019s spreading throughout a community.\n\nIt\u2019s more complicated when it reaches into an institution like a jail, where measures like social distancing are tougher to institute. And when an outbreak is happening in one of the largest jails in the country, things can be trickier still.\n\nThat\u2019s where Lieutenant Commander Paige Armstrong, an officer in the US Public Health Service, found herself in mid-April, helping the Chicago Department of Public Health contain an outbreak of COVID-19 in the Cook County jail. A physician, medical epidemiologist, and veteran of CDC\u2019s response to the 2015-2016 Zika virus outbreak, Paige led the CDC team to help jail administrators and medical staff get COVID-19 under control.\n\n\u201cThe jail campus covers eight city blocks and houses people in 13 different buildings, and each building has unique characteristics,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s as though you\u2019re trying to control an outbreak in 13 different settings, with the added element of staff moving between them.\u201d\n\nAt that time, the jail held more than 4,000 people awaiting court dates, trial, or serving post-conviction sentences. And Chicago was one of the pandemic\u2019s early US hot spots, so the disease was spreading widely outside the walls.\n\nThe Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office had taken steps to fight the outbreak inside by conducting extensive testing, reducing cells to single occupancy, and quarantining the entire unit when a person who was incarcerated tested positive. The CDC team started by trying to figure out whether prevention and control measures were working and what else might be needed. They worked with city, county, and state health departments, the sheriff\u2019s office, and the company that provided medical services at the jail.  They tracked building-by-building data on cases, hospitalizations, and deaths among staff and people in custody, looking for trends and emerging clusters of illness. \u201cWe found that the interventions were effectively reducing new cases, but that didn\u2019t mean the work was done,\u201d Paige says. \u201cIt meant these resource-intensive efforts to quarantine, isolate, screen, socially distance, and enhance cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces needed to continue. And when you consider the size of the jail, you realize that requires a lot of coordination and effort from everyone.\u201d\n\nIn Chicago, those measures gradually started to bear fruit. Each day, the number of units placed on quarantine declined, until one day there were none.\n\n\u201cEveryone breathed a sigh of relief,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had turned a corner.\u201d\n\nChicago was Paige\u2019s second deployment for the COVID-19 response. She also helped repatriate cruise ship passengers when they were quarantined at an airbase outside Atlanta. When she\u2019s not deployed for emergency responses, Paige specializes in stopping tickborne rickettsial diseases.\n\nShe traces her interest in public health back to high school in New Haven, Connecticut. A summer trip visiting relatives in Ecuador made her want \u201cto work alongside communities and to give back,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI grew up in a family that valued community service,\u201d she says. Her mother is a teacher, her father an EMT and volunteer firefighter. At 14, she volunteered with an aid organization that built latrines and installed cooking stoves that diverted smoke outside of homes in Mexico\u2014the first of many trips where she worked on sanitation and health projects in Latin America.\n\nAs a student at Johns Hopkins University, she volunteered as a Spanish interpreter in free clinics in Baltimore. She returned to Connecticut for medical school and specialized in emergency medicine at George Washington University in Washington, DC.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed working with populations who have slightly higher needs or challenges accessing healthcare,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been rewarding in the sense that I can appreciate the impact and make a difference.\u201d\n\nThat led her to CDC, after a mentor recommended she apply for the Epidemic Intelligence Service \u2013 the \u201cdisease detectives\u201d who pursue outbreaks of illness. After her two-year fellowship with EIS, she joined the agency full-time in 2017.\n\n\u201cNo one thing and no one person does it all,\u201d she says. \u201cBut together, we can make a difference.\u201d",

            "HeadLine": "Evaluation and Management Considerations for Neonates At Risk for COVID-19",
            "Text": "Since the May 2020 posting of this guidance, several publications have reported the outcomes of neonates born to mothers with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. These publications have been used to inform this guidance update. CDC will continue to examine data on the risk of infection and outcomes for neonates born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection and will update this guidance as new information becomes available.\n\nRoutes of transmission\nTransmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to neonates is thought to occur primarily through respiratory droplets during the postnatal period when neonates are exposed to mothers or other caregivers with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Limited reports in the literature have raised concern of possible intrauterine, intrapartum, or peripartum transmission, but the extent and clinical significance of vertical transmission, which appears to be rare, is unclear. At this time, there are insufficient data to make recommendations on routine delayed cord clamping or immediate skin-to-skin care for the purpose of preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission to the neonate.\n\nClinical presentation and disease severity\nReported signs among neonates with SARS-CoV-2 infection include fever, lethargy, rhinorrhea, cough, tachypnea, increased work of breathing, vomiting, diarrhea, and poor feeding. The extent to which SARS-CoV-2 infection contributed to the reported signs of infection and complications is unclear, as many of these findings are common in term and preterm infants for other reasons (e.g., transient tachypnea of the newborn, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome).\n\nCurrent evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infections in neonates are uncommon. If neonates do become infected, the majority have either asymptomatic infections or mild disease (i.e., do not require respiratory support), and they recover. Severe illness in neonates, including illness requiring mechanical ventilation, has been reported but appears to be rare. Neonates with underlying medical conditions and preterm infants (<37 weeks gestational age) may be at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.\n\nTesting recommendations\nTesting is recommended for all neonates born to mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, regardless of whether there are signs of infection in the neonate. For neonates presenting with signs of infection suggestive of COVID-19, as described above, providers should also consider alternative diagnoses.\n\nRecommended testing\n\nDiagnosis should be confirmed by testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be collected using nasopharynx, oropharynx, or nasal swab samples.\nSerologic testing is not recommended at this time to diagnose acute infection in neonates.\nWhen to test\n\nBoth symptomatic and asymptomatic neonates born to mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, regardless of mother\u2019s symptoms, should have testing performed at approximately 24 hours of age. If initial test results are negative, or not available, testing should be repeated at 48 hours of age.\nFor asymptomatic neonates expected to be discharged at <48 hours of age, a single test can be performed prior to discharge, between 24-48 hours of age.\nPrioritization of testing\n\nIn areas with limited testing capacity, testing should be prioritized for neonates with signs suggestive of COVID-19 as well neonates with SARS-CoV-2 exposure requiring higher levels of care or who are expected to have prolonged hospitalizations (>48-72 hours depending on delivery mode).\nLimitations and interpretation of testing\n\nThe optimal timing of testing after birth is unknown. Early testing may lead to false positives (e.g., if the neonate\u2019s nares, nasopharynx and/or oropharynx are contaminated by SARS-CoV-2 RNA in maternal fluids) or false negatives (e.g., RNA may not yet be detectable immediately after exposure following birth).\nInfection prevention and control\nRates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates do not appear to be affected by mode of delivery, method of infant feeding, or contact with a mother with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. All neonates born to mothers with suspected or confirmed infection should be considered as having suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection when test results are not available.\n\nIn general, mothers with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and their neonates should be isolated from other healthy mothers and neonates and cared for according to recommended infection prevention and control practices for routine healthcare delivery. If a neonate does not remain in the mother\u2019s room, facilities should consider the institution\u2019s capacity and resources as well as the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to other high-risk neonates when determining where the neonate should be isolated.\n\nIsolating infants with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) should be avoided unless the neonate\u2019s clinical condition warrants NICU admission. Locating neonates with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in a NICU may unnecessarily increase the risk of exposing other vulnerable infants and NICU staff to SARS-CoV-2. In some hospitals, a NICU may be the only suitable environment for appropriate care of an isolated neonate. Therefore, determination about best placement should be made at the facility level.\n\nMother/neonatal contact\nEarly and close contact between the mother and neonate has many well-established benefits. The ideal setting for care of a healthy, term newborn while in the hospital is in the mother\u2019s room, commonly called \u201crooming-in.\u201d Current evidence suggests the risk of a neonate acquiring SARS-CoV-2 from its mother is low. Further, data suggests that there is no difference in risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to the neonate whether a neonate is cared for in a separate room or remains in the mother\u2019s room.\n\nThere is, however, a potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to the neonate via contact with infectious respiratory secretions from the mother, caregiver, or other person with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including just before the individual develops symptoms when viral replication may be high. As such, all caregivers should practice infection prevention and control measures (i.e., wearing a mask, practicing hand hygiene) before and while caring for a neonate.\n\nMothers with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection may feel uncomfortable with this potential risk. Ideally, each mother and her healthcare providers should discuss whether she would like the neonate to be cared for in her room or a separate location if she is suspected or confirmed of having COVID-19, weighing the considerations listed below. It\u2019s easiest to begin this conversation during prenatal care and continue it through the intrapartum period. Healthcare providers should respect maternal autonomy in the medical decision-making process.\n\nConsiderations for discussions on whether a neonate should remain in the mother\u2019s room include:\n\nMothers who room-in with their infants can more easily learn and respond to their feeding cues, which helps establish breastfeeding. Breastfeeding reduces morbidity and mortality for both mothers and their infants. Mothers who choose to breastfeed should take measures, including wearing a mask and practicing hand hygiene, to minimize the risk of virus transmission while feeding. Additional information for healthcare providers on breastfeeding in the context of COVID-19 is available.\nMother-infant bonding is facilitated by keeping the neonate with its mother.\nRooming-in promotes family-centered care and can allow for parent education about newborn care and infection prevention and control practices.\nMothers with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection should not be considered as posing a potential risk of virus transmission to their neonates if they have met the criteria for discontinuing isolation and precautions:\nAt least 10 days have passed since their symptoms first appeared (up to 20 days if they have more severe to critical illness or are severely immunocompromised), and\nAt least 24 hours have passed since their last fever without the use of antipyretics, and\nTheir other symptoms have improved.\nMothers who have not met these criteria may choose to temporarily separate from their neonates in effort to reduce the risk of virus transmission. However, if after discharge they will not be able to maintain separation from their neonate until they meet the criteria, it is unclear whether temporary separation while in the hospital would ultimately prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission to the neonate, given the potential for exposure from the mother after discharge.\nSeparation may be necessary for mothers who are too ill to care for their infants or who need higher levels of care.\nSeparation may be necessary for neonates at higher risk for severe illness (e.g., preterm infants, infants with underlying medical conditions, infants needing higher levels of care).\nSeparation in order to reduce the risk of transmission from a mother with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 to her neonate may not be necessary if the neonate tests positive for SARS-CoV-2.\nMeasures to minimize risk of transmission\n\nIf the neonate remains in the mother\u2019s room, measures that can be taken to minimize the risk of transmission from a mother with suspected or confirmed COVID-19  to her neonate include:\n\nMothers should wear a mask and practice hand hygiene during all contact with their neonates. Of note, plastic infant face shields are not recommended and masks should not be placed on neonates or children younger than 2 years of age.\nEngineering controls, such as maintaining a physical distance of >6 feet between the mother and neonate or placing the neonate in an incubator, should be used when feasible. If the infant is kept in an incubator, it is important to educate the mother and other caregivers, including hospital personnel, on proper use (i.e., latching doors) in order to prevent newborn falls.\nA healthy caregiver who is not at increased risk for severe illness, using appropriate infection prevention precautions (e.g., wearing a mask, practicing hand hygiene), should provide care for the neonate, if possible.\n\nDisposition\nNeonates who otherwise meet clinical criteria for dischargeexternal icon do not require the results of SARS-CoV-2 testing for discharge. If available, results from the neonate\u2019s test should be communicated to the family and outpatient healthcare provider.\n\nTo determine when to end home isolation for a neonate with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, parents and other caregivers should follow published recommendations. Neonates with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, or ongoing exposure, require close outpatient follow-up after discharge.",

            "HeadLine": "Interim Considerations for Health Departments for SARS-CoV-2 Testing in Homeless Shelters and Encampments",
            "Text": "These interim considerations are based on what is currently known about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 as of the date of posting, July 1, 2020.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will update these considerations as needed and as additional information becomes available. Please check the following CDC website periodically for updated interim guidance.\n\nNote: This document is intended to provide considerations on the appropriate use of testing and does not dictate the determination of payment decisions or insurance coverage of such testing, except as may be otherwise referenced (or prescribed) by another entity or federal or state agency. CDC is a non-regulatory agency; therefore, the information in this document is meant to assist health departments and homeless service providers in making decisions rather than establishing regulatory requirements.\n\nHomeless service provider sites and encampments can present unique challenges for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) investigations and public health action. In congregate settings such as homeless shelters, the virus may spread easily among clients, staff, and volunteers. Additionally, many people experiencing homelessness are older adults or have underlying medical conditions [1], [2], which increases their risk of severe illness from COVID-19. This document describes testing strategies for homeless shelters and encampments. Testing to diagnose COVID-19 is one component of a comprehensive strategy and should be used in conjunction with promoting behaviors that reduce spread, maintaining healthy environments, maintaining healthy operations, and preparing for when someone gets sick.\n\nState, Tribal, territorial, and local health departments should review these considerations in the context of local recommendations, resources, acceptability, and feasibility. These considerations are meant to supplement\u2014not replace\u2014any federal, state, local, territorial, or Tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations. For details on appropriate procedures and safety measures and personal protective equipment to use during testing, see procedure for testing in congregate settings.\n\nThe purpose and process of all testing and other public health activities should be clearly communicated to clients and staff at the homeless service site to promote understanding and acceptability. Testing strategies should be carried out in a way that protects privacy and confidentiality to the extent possible and that is consistent with applicable laws and regulations. In addition to state and local laws, regulations and policies, site administrators should follow guidance from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commissionexternal icon when offering testing to staff. Any time a positive test result is identified, ensure that the individual is rapidly and appropriately notified, separated from others, provided appropriate medical care, and linked to appropriate alternative housing for isolation, as necessary. Additionally, review the guidance for responding to cases at homeless shelters.\n\nTypes of COVID-19 tests\nViral tests are recommended to diagnose current infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Viral tests evaluate whether the virus is present in a respiratory sample. Results from these tests help public health officials identify and isolate people who are infected to minimize COVID-19 transmission.\n\nAntibody tests are used to determine a past infection with SARS-CoV-2. CDC does not currently recommend using antibody testing as the sole basis for diagnosing current infection. Because it is currently not clear whether a positive antibody test indicates immunity against SARS-CoV-2, antibody tests cannot be used to determine if an individual is immune.\n\nCDC recommendations for SARS-CoV-2 testing have been developed based on what is currently known about COVID-19 and are subject to change as additional information becomes available.\n\nWhen testing might be needed\nThe following document describes scenarios when SARS-CoV-2 viral testing may be appropriate in homeless shelters and encampments and outlines how to use community transmission levels to guide which testing strategies to use:\n\nTesting individuals with signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19\nTesting asymptomatic individuals with recent known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 to control transmission\nTesting individuals with signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19\nConsistent with CDC\u2019s recommendations, individuals with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 should be referred to a healthcare provider for evaluation and possible testing. One strategy to identify people with symptoms is to conduct symptom screening during standard shelter and outreach practices. However, because screening cannot identify individuals with COVID-19 who may be asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic, this strategy alone cannot prevent all individuals with COVID-19 from entering homeless service provider sites. Screenings should be conducted safely and respectfully and in accordance with any applicable privacy laws and regulations.\n\nClients, staff, or volunteers who have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 should wear a mask, if able. Staff and volunteers with symptoms should be advised to go or stay home. Clients with symptoms should be directed to stay in a pre-designated area, separated from other shelter clients and ideally in individual rooms.\n\nPublic health planning should incorporate arrangements for how symptomatic people who are experiencing homelessness will access testing, ideally with a rapid turnaround, whether by facilitating access to healthcare through Federally Qualified Health Centers or other community providers, shelter-based clinics, or mobile testing. Special consideration should be given to ensuring that people who are experiencing homelessness and have symptoms of COVID-19 have access to medical care.\n\nTesting asymptomatic individuals with recent known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 to control transmission\nTesting is recommended for all close contacts of persons with COVID-19. Typically, people who are close contacts are identified through person-based contact tracing. However, in homeless service sites and encampments, crowding, mixing of clients and staff, and other constraints can limit the effectiveness of person-based contact tracing. Given challenges with tracing close contacts of people experiencing homelessness, location-based contact tracing can be used to identify potentially exposed sites rather than individual contact-based tracings. In these situations, broader testing of clients, staff, and volunteers (e.g., facility-wide testing, as defined below) can be considered as a part of a strategy to control transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Additional considerations during quarantine and while awaiting test results include:\n\nAll individuals with potential exposure should wear masks, if able.\nClients may need access to specific quarantine housing and staff should be advised to quarantine at home, as possible.\nAnyone with known or suspected exposure who develops symptoms should be linked to follow-up testing, even if they had initially tested negative.\nSee further details below on integrating exposure-based testing into a public health strategy. \n\nTesting asymptomatic individuals without known exposure to SARS-CoV-2 for early identification in homeless shelters and encampments\nIn special populations, testing of asymptomatic individuals without known exposure to SARS-CoV-2 may allow for early identification of COVID-19 cases and outbreaks, especially among persons in congregate living settings. If there is moderate or substantial transmission in the community, initial and regular facility-wide testing may be considered as approaches to limit the virus\u2019s spread in homeless shelters [3].\n\nIt is unknown if entry testing for homeless service sites and encampments provides any additional reduction in person-to-person transmission of the virus beyond what would be expected with implementation of other infection preventive measures (e.g., social distancing, masks, hand washing, enhanced cleaning and disinfection). Therefore, CDC does not recommend entry testing for homeless service sites and encampments.\n\nUsing community transmission levels to guide asymptomatic testing\nFlexible strategies are necessary to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE) in homeless shelters and encampments. This section describes how the level of community transmission can be used to guide decisions about the types of testing strategies that may be considered. Health departments and administrators of homeless service sites, in partnership with healthcare providers, should decide whether and how to implement these testing considerations to identify cases among people who are asymptomatic, including both those with and without known exposure to COVID-19.\n\nThose providing services for people experiencing homelessness should continue to follow guidance for basic COVID-19 prevention among people who are staying in homeless shelters or experiencing unsheltered homelessness.\n\nFacility-wide (universal) testing involves offering viral testing for SARS-CoV-2 to all clients and staff who were affiliated with the site or encampment any time from 2 days before the individual began experiencing symptoms, or 2 days before a positive test in an asymptomatic individual, until they were isolated.\n\nAny client who tests positive should be connected to a place where they can safely isolate and access necessary services until they meet criteria to discontinue isolation.\nStaff who test positive should be advised to seek medical care as needed and to stay home until they meet criteria to discontinue isolation.\nRepeat testing of all previously negative or untested clients, staff, and volunteers (e.g., once a week) is recommended until the testing identifies no new cases of COVID-19 for at least 14 days since the most recent positive result.\nIt will not always be possible to provide testing to every individual who would qualify, but the intent is to broadly offer testing to anyone who might have been exposed. \nCommunity transmission categories: The transmission categories included in Table 1 are described in the CDC Community Mitigation Framework. Health departments should consider setting precise incidence indicators that reflect these categories and are suitable to the local context.\n\nTable 1: Identifying when facility-wide testing in homeless shelters or encampments is indicated\n\nTable 1: Identifying when facility-wide testing in homeless shelters or encampments is indicated\nNone to Minimal\tMinimal to Moderate\tModerate to Substantial\nCommunity Transmission Description\tIsolated cases or limited community transmission; case investigations under way; no evidence of exposure in large communal setting\tSustained transmission that is not large-scale but with high likelihood or confirmed exposure in communal settings and with the potential for rapid increase in cases\tLarge-scale, uncontrolled or controlled community transmission, including in communal settings\nBaseline Activities\tConduct regular case identification and investigation*\tIncrease access to testing at the site according to designated criteria**\tConsider initial and regular facility-wide testing\nWhen to Conduct Facility-wide Testing\tA laboratory-confirmed case is identified at the site, or\nA laboratory-confirmed case is identified in a sentinel site***, or\nA cluster of probable cases at the site exceeds a pre-determined threshold, or\nA site is identified in location-based contact tracing\tNo trigger needed; follow-up testing triggered if cases are identified\n*Passive surveillance.\n**Active surveillance; see below for example criteria.\n***Sentinel site= a site that provides a signal for whether outbreaks might be occurring at adjacent sites.\n\nCommunity transmission is none to minimal: Regular case identification and investigation\nIn areas where community transmission is none to minimal, health departments should use their standard surveillance system (passive surveillance) and case investigation processes to identify confirmed and probable cases (according to the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists case definition of COVID-19pdf iconexternal icon) among people experiencing homelessness or homeless service staff:\n\nInvestigate whether infected individuals have been affiliated with any homeless service facility or encampment (e.g., working or staying there) from 48 hours before they had symptoms until they were isolated, even if it was not their primary place of work or shelter.\nConduct facility-wide testing as soon as possible if a person affiliated with the site is confirmed to have COVID-19.\nReview CDC guidance for responding to cases at homeless service sites for further information about case investigation and outbreak response.\nCommunity transmission is minimal to moderate: Increase asymptomatic testing access\nIn addition to the regular case identification and investigation strategies described above, health departments in areas where community transmission is minimal to moderate can consider working with partners to increase testing access in homeless shelters and encampments (i.e., creating an active surveillance system). Offering testing systematically to individuals affiliated with the site according to designated criteria can increase the likelihood of early identification of cases. Examples of increased testing strategies that health departments or health care providers could use alone or in combination for homeless shelters include:\n\nEnhanced symptom-based testing access: Increase access to testing and early identification of cases by stationing medical providers at homeless service sites to offer testing to anyone with symptoms of COVID-19. If any client, staff member, or volunteer tests positive, then conduct facility-wide testing.\nRandom-selection testing: Offer testing to randomly selected clients, staff, or volunteers (e.g., every third person) at the site on a regular basis. If a client or staff member tests positive, then conduct facility-wide testing. Although jurisdictions may choose to use this option, the ideal frequency of testing is still unknown.\nSetting positive symptom screening thresholds: Track instances of COVID-like illness (e.g., probable casespdf iconexternal icon) at the site if testing is pending or not available. Set a threshold for response similar to what you might use at a long-term care facility, for example >2 cases of COVID-like illness are identified at the facility within 14 days. If the pre-defined threshold is surpassed, then conduct facility-wide testing.\nSentinel sites: Choose a single site to conduct regular (e.g., weekly), facility-wide testing. Or, consider connected sites to be sentinel sites for each other (e.g., correctional facilities or nearby homeless shelters). If one or more cases are identified in the sentinel site, then conduct facility-wide testing at each site.\nCommunity transmission is substantial: Initial and regular testing\nIn areas where community transmission is substantial, health departments may consider coordinating with partners to offer facility-wide testing for all clients, volunteers, and staff in all sites at least once, regardless of whether an initial case of COVID-19 has been identified. Repeat testing of all previously negative or untested clients, volunteers, and staff (e.g., once a week) is recommended until the testing identifies no new cases of COVID-19 for at least 14 days since the most recent positive result. If resources for testing are limited, consider prioritizing sites for testing according to one or more of these factors:",

            "HeadLine": "Interim Guidelines for COVID-19 Antibody Testing",
            "Text": "Summary Serologic methods have important public health and clinical uses for monitoring and responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSeveral serologic assays for SARS-CoV-2 have Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has independently reviewed their performance.\nCurrently, there is no identified advantage whether the assays test for IgG, IgM and IgG, or total antibody.\nIt is important to minimize false-positive test results by choosing an assay with high specificity and by testing populations and individuals with an elevated likelihood of previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Alternatively, an orthogonal testing algorithm (i.e., employing two independent tests in sequence when the first test yields a positive result) can be used when the expected positive predictive value of a single test is low.\nAntibodies most commonly become detectable 1\u20133 weeks after symptom onset, at which time evidence suggests that infectiousness likely is greatly decreased and that some degree of immunity from future infection has developed. However, additional data are needed before modifying public health recommendations based on serologic test results, including decisions on discontinuing physical distancing and using personal protective equipment.\nBackground\nSerologic assays for SARS-CoV-2, now broadly available, can play an important role in understanding the virus\u2019s epidemiology in the general population and identifying groups at higher risk for infection. Unlike direct detection methods such as viral nucleic acid amplification or antigen detection tests that can detect acutely infected persons, antibody tests help determine whether the individual being tested was previously infected\u2014even if that person never showed symptoms. Serologic tests detect resolving or past SARS-CoV-2 virus infection indirectly by measuring the person\u2019s humoral immune response to the virus. Therefore, serologic assays do not typically replace direct detection methods as the primary tool for diagnosing an active SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they do have several important applications in monitoring and responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAlthough serologic tests should not be used at this time to determine if an individual is immune, these tests can help determine the proportion of a population previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and provide information about populations that may be immune and potentially protected. Thus, demographic and geographic patterns of serologic test results can help determine which communities may have experienced a higher infection rate and therefore may have a higher proportion of the population with some degree of immunity, at least temporarily. In some instances, serologic test results may assist with identifying persons potentially infected with SARS-CoV-2 and determining who may qualify to donate blood that can be used to manufacture convalescent plasmaexternal icon as a possible treatment for those who are seriously ill from COVID-19.\n\nDevelopment of Antibodies and Immunity\nNearly all immune-competent individuals will develop an immune response following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Like infections with other pathogens, SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits development of IgM and IgG antibodies, which are the most useful for assessing antibody response because little is known about IgA response in the blood.\n\nAntibodies in some persons can be detected within the first week of illness onset. In SARS-CoV-2 infections, IgM and IgG antibodies can arise nearly simultaneously in serum within 2 to 3 weeks after illness onset. Thus, detection of IgM without IgG is uncommon. How long IgM and IgG antibodies remain detectable following infection is not known. It is also important to note that some persons do not develop detectable IgG or IgM antibodies following infection. Thus, the absence of detectable IgM or IgG antibodies does not necessarily rule out that they could have previously been infected.\n\nIn addition, development of neutralizing antibodies can also be assessed. Neutralizing antibodies inhibit viral replication in vitro, and as with many infectious diseases, their presence correlates with immunity to future infection, at least temporarily.\n\nRecurrence of COVID-19 illness appears to be very uncommon, suggesting that the presence of antibodies could indicate at least short-term immunity to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with this observation, experimental primary infection in primates and subsequent development of antibodies resulted in protection from reinfection after the primates were rechallenged. Additionally, antibody development in humans correlates with a marked decrease in viral load in the respiratory tract. Taken together, these observations suggest that the presence of antibodies may decrease a person\u2019s infectiousness and offer some level of protection from reinfection. However, it remains uncertain to what degree and for how long individuals with antibodies (neutralizing or total) are protected against reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 or what concentration of antibodies may be needed to provide such protection.\n\nCurrent Status of Antibody Testing in the United States\nAntigenic targets\nThe two major antigenic targets of SARS-CoV-2 virus against which antibodies are detected are spike glycoprotein (S) and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N). While S protein is essential for virus entry and is present on the viral surface, N protein is the most abundantly expressed immunodominant protein that interacts with RNA. Multiple forms of S protein\u2014full-length (S1+S2) or partial (S1 domain or receptor binding domain [RBD])\u2014are used as antigens. The protein target determines cross-reactivity and specificity because N is more conserved across coronaviruses than S, and within S, RBD is more conserved than S1 or full-length S.\n\nTypes of Antibody Testing\nDifferent types of assays can be used to determine different aspects of immune response and functionality of antibodies. The tests can be broadly classified to detect either binding or neutralizing antibodies.\n\nBinding antibody detection: These tests use purified proteins of SARS-CoV-2, not live virus, and can be performed in lower biosafety level laboratories (e.g., BSL-2). With specific reagents, individual antibody types, like IgG, IgM, and IgA, can be determined. Although scientists do not know how long antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 can be detected, for most other infections, IgM is most useful for determining recent infection as it usually becomes undetectable weeks to months following infection, while IgG may remain detectable for months or years. IgA is important for mucosal immunity and can be detected in mucous secretions like saliva in addition to blood, though its significance in this disease is still to be determined. Depending on the complexity of assays, these tests can be performed rapidly (in less than 30 minutes) in a field setting or in a few hours in a laboratory.Tests that detect binding antibodies fall into two broad categories.\nPoint-of-care (POC) tests generally are lateral flow devices that detect IgG, IgG and IgM, or total antibody in serum, plasma, whole blood, and/or saliva. An advantage of some point-of-care tests using whole blood is that they can be performed on blood samples obtained by fingerstick rather than venipuncture.\nLaboratory tests use ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) or CIA (chemiluminescent immunoassay) methods for antibody detection, which for some assays may require trained laboratorians and specialized instruments. Based on the reagents, IgG, IgM, and IgA can be detected separately or combined as total antibody.\nSurrogate virus neutralization tests (sVNT) have also been developed. These are binding antibody tests designed to detect potential neutralizing antibodies, often those that prevent interaction of RBD with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, the cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2). Because these tests do not require live virus, they can be conducted in BSL-2 laboratories.\n\nNeutralizing antibody detection: FDA has not yet authorized the use of neutralization tests for SARS-CoV-2. Neutralization tests determine the functional ability of antibodies to prevent infection of virus in vitro. The tests involve incubating serum or plasma with live virus followed by infection and incubation of cells. Testing will require either BSL-3 or BSL-2 laboratories, depending on what form of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is used.Two types of neutralization tests are conducted.\nVirus neutralization tests (VNT), such as the plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and microneutralization, use a SARS-CoV-2 virus from a clinical isolate or recombinant SARS-CoV-2 expressing reporter proteins. This testing requires BSL-3 laboratories and may take up to 5 days to complete.\nPseudovirus neutralization tests (pVNT) use recombinant pseudoviruses (like vesicular stomatitis virus, VSV) that incorporate the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. This testing can be performed in BSL-2 laboratories depending on the VSV strain used.\nFDA-authorized serologic tests FDA now requires commercially marketed serologic tests to receive Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)external icon. Tests that are not commercially marketed do not require FDA authorization, but developers may voluntarily request authorization. Multiple agencies\u2014including FDA, the National Cancer Institute/National Institutes of Health (NCI/NIH), CDC, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA)\u2014are collaborating with members of academia and the medical community to evaluate several serology tests using a well-characterized set of clinical samples (serum or plasma) collected before and during the current COVID-19 outbreak. A list of all tests authorized for emergency use under EUA is maintained on an FDA websiteexternal icon. All currently authorized tests are qualitative (providing a result that is positive, negative, or indeterminate) rather than quantitative (providing a quantitative assessment of antibody levels).\n\nBoth laboratory and rapid serologic assays have received EUA. Serologic testing technologies include single-use, low-throughput lateral flow tests where the presence of antibody is demonstrated by a color change on a paper strip and laboratory-based immunoassays that allow for processing of many samples at the same time.\n\nThe EUA letter of authorization includes the settings in which the test is authorized, based on FDA\u2019s determination of appropriate settings for use during the public health emergency.\n\nOptimizing Testing Outcomes\nTest performance\nThe utility of tests depends on the sensitivity and specificity of the assays; these performance characteristics are determined by using a defined set of negative and positive samples. In addition, the predictive values of a test should be considered because these values affect the overall outcome of testing. Positive predictive value is the probability that individuals with positive test results are truly antibody positive. Negative predictive value is the probability that individuals with negative test results are truly antibody negative. Positive and negative predictive values are determined by the percentage of truly antibody positive individuals in the tested population (prevalence, pre-test probability) and the sensitivity and specificity of the test. For example:\n\nIn a high-prevalence setting, the positive predictive value increases\u2014meaning it is more likely that persons who test positive are truly antibody positive\u2014than if the test is performed in a population with low prevalence. When a test is used in a population where prevalence is low, the positive predictive value drops because there are more false-positive results, since the pre-test probability is low.\nLikewise, negative predictive value is also affected by prevalence. In a high-prevalence setting, the negative predictive value declines whereas in a low-prevalence setting, it increases.\nIn most of the country, including areas that have been heavily impacted by COVID-19, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody is expected to be low, ranging from <5% to 25%, so that testing at this point might result in relatively more false-positive results and fewer false-negative results.\n\nIn some settings, such as COVID-19 outbreaks in food processing plants and congregate living facilities, the prevalence of infection in the population may be significantly higher. In such settings, serologic testing at appropriate intervals following outbreaks might result in relatively fewer false-positive results and more false-negative results.\n\nTesting strategies\nIn the current pandemic, maximizing specificity and thus positive predictive value in a serologic algorithm is preferred in most instances, since the overall prevalence of antibodies in most populations is likely low. For example, in a population where the prevalence is 5%, a test with 90% sensitivity and 95% specificity will yield a positive predictive value of 49%. In other words, less than half of those testing positive will truly have antibodies. Alternatively, the same test in a population with an antibody prevalence exceeding 52% will yield a positive predictive value greater than 95%, meaning that fewer than one in 20 people testing positive will have a false-positive test result.\n\nThree strategies can be used to improve positive predictive value:\n\nChoosing a test with a very high specificity, perhaps 99.5% or greater, will yield a high positive predictive value in populations tested with low prevalence; however, the positive predictive value will show some variation based on the population prevalence with a single test strategy. Table 1 presents the positive predictive value for hypothetical populations with various SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalences using a test with 90% sensitivity and 99.8% specificity.\nAnother strategy is to focus testing on persons with a high pre-test probability of having SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, such as persons with a history of COVID-19-like illness.\nA third approach is to employ an orthogonal testing algorithm in which persons who initially test positive are tested with a second test. Effective orthogonal algorithms are generally based on testing a patient sample with two tests, each with unique design characteristics (e.g., antigens or formats).\nSeveral testsexternal icon are available with specificities of 99.5% or greater. Because specificity may vary according to the panel of specimens collected, FDA, NIH, and CDC have conducted an independent evaluationexternal icon of some tests using a standard panel of specimens. Specificities of at least 99.5% are required to achieve a high positive predictive value in low-prevalence populations (Table 1). Tests with lower specificity, for example a specificity of 95%, will result in suboptimal positive predictive values when used in low-prevalence populations. In this situation, orthogonal testing algorithms can be designed to maximize overall specificity while retaining maximum sensitivity.\n\nThe performance of orthogonal testing algorithms has not been systematically evaluated but can be estimated using an online calculatorexternal icon from FDA. See Table 2 for the potential improvement benefits of the orthogonal testing algorithm. The type of antigen and the Ig class of both tests in an orthogonal testing algorithm should be considered when interpreting test results. For example, a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 may develop an immune response that is heavily biased towards a particular viral protein (e.g., spike protein). This scenario may result in discordant test results if the detection antigens in the first and second tests were spike protein and nucleoprotein, respectively. Similarly, the temporal dynamics of virus-specific IgM and IgG immune responses may differ following infection. In this scenario, using tests that detect different Ig classes (total Ig, IgM or IgG) may lead to discordant results.\n\nLimitations of Serologic Tests\nAt present, the immunologic correlates of immunity from SARS-CoV-2 infection are not well defined. Representatives from BARDA, CDC, FDA, NIH, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), Department of Defense (DoD), and White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) are working with members of academia and the medical community to determine whether positive serologic tests are indicative of protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. This work includes assessing the level of antibodies required for protection from reinfection, the duration of that protection, and the factors associated with development of a protective antibody response. The kinetics of antibody response, longevity of antibodies, the ability of antibodies to protect from repeat infection, the protective titer of neutralizing antibody, and the correlation of binding antibody titers to neutralization ability are yet to be determined. Although animal challenge studies demonstrate protection in the short run, demonstration of long-term protection in humans will require future study. Hence, pending additional data, the presence of antibodies cannot be equated with an individual\u2019s immunity from SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nSome tests may exhibit cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses, such as those that cause the common cold. This could result in false-positive test results. Some persons may not develop detectable antibodies after coronavirus infection. In others, it is possible that antibody levels could wane over time to undetectable levels. IgM and IgG antibodies may take 1 to 3 weeks to develop after infection. Thus, serologic test results do not indicate with certainty the presence or absence of current or previous infection with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nRecommendations for Use of Serologic Tests\nInformation that might impact serologic recommendations is rapidly evolving, particularly evidence of whether positive serologic tests indicate protective immunity or decreased transmissibility among those recently ill. These recommendations will be updated as new information becomes available.\n\nChoice of test and testing strategy\nSerologic assays that have Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) are preferred for public health or clinical use since their test performance data have been reviewed by FDA.\nSerologic test results should be interpreted in the context of the expected predictive values, positive and negative.\nPositive predictive value should be optimized, particularly if results are returned to individuals, in the following ways:\nAssure a high positive predictive value (e.g., 95%) by choosing tests with sufficiently high specificity (e.g., > 99.5%) and testing persons or populations with a high pre-test probability of having antibodies (e.g., persons with a history of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 or who are exposed to areas or institutions experiencing outbreaks), OR\nIf a high positive predictive value cannot be assured with a single test, use an orthogonal testing algorithm. See Table 2 for examples of using one or two tests in populations with various prevalences of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.\nCurrently, there is no substantive performance advantage of assays whether they test for IgG, IgM and IgG, or total antibody. Thus, immunoglobulin class should not determine the assay chosen in most circumstances. The detection of IgM antibodies may indicate a more recent infection, but the dynamics of the IgM antibody response are not well defined at present. Over time, it may be important to characterize and evaluate the performance of assays in samples that are IgM negative and IgG positive to ensure that assays remain fit for purpose in population studies as the pandemic progresses and more individuals are expected to have lower IgM levels.\nSerologic testing should not be used to determine immune status in individuals until the presence, durability, and duration of immunity are established.\nSerologic testing can be offered as a method to support diagnosis of acute COVID-19 illness for persons who present late.* For persons who present 9\u201314 days after illness onset, serologic testing can be offered in addition to recommended viral direct detection methods such as polymerase chain reaction or antigen detection tests. During this time period, the sensitivity of nucleic acid detection is decreasing, and the sensitivity of serologic testing is increasing.\nSerologic testing should be offered as a method to help support a diagnosis when patients present with late complications of COVID-19 illness, such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.\nSerologic testing by itself should not be used to establish the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or reinfection. Antibodies may not be present among those tested early in illness before antibodies develop or among those who never develop detectable antibodies following infection. In addition, the presence of antibodies may reflect previous infection and may be unrelated to the current illness.\nRecommendations for persons who test positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies\nThe presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies indicates a previous infection and possibly at least some degree of immunity or protection against future SARS-CoV-2 infection.  However, until the durability and duration of immunity are established, it cannot be assumed that individuals who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, including total antibody, IgM, IgG, or IgA, are protected from future infection.\nAsymptomatic persons who test positive by serologic testing without recent history of a COVID-19 confirmed or compatible illness have a low likelihood of active infection and should follow general recommendations to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2. They should continue with normal activities, including work.\nPersons who have had a COVID-19 compatible or confirmed illness should follow previous guidance regarding when to resume normal activities, including work, regardless of the presence of antibodies.\nThere should be no change in clinical practice or use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by health care workers and first responders who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibody.\nAdditional considerations on the use of serologic tests\nSerologic test results should not be used to make decisions about grouping persons residing in or being admitted to congregate settings, such as schools, dormitories, or correctional facilities.\nSerologic test results should not be used to make decisions about returning persons to the workplace.\nUntil more information is available about the dynamics of IgA detection in serum, testing for IgA antibodies is not recommended.\n* Detection of specific antibody in serum, plasma, or whole blood that indicates new or recent infection provides presumptive laboratory evidence of COVID-19 illness according to the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) interim case definition for COVID-19pdf iconexternal icon.",

            "Text": "CDC offers the following considerations for ways in which administrators of retirement communities and independent living facilities can help protect residents, workers, visitors, and communities and slow the spread of COVID-19. These considerations are for administrators of retirement communities and independent living facilities that are not healthcare facilities. Learn more about guidance for long-term care facilities (LTCFs) that offer medical services (e.g., nursing homes, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, day care programs for older adults).\n\nA retirement community or independent living facility is a residential or housing community that is usually age-restricted (e.g., aged 55 and older) with residents who are partially or fully retired and can generally care for themselves without regular nursing or other routine medical assistance. Communal facilities, community activities, meals, transportation, and socialization opportunities may be provided. Different types of independent housing with support services for older adults include:\n\nPublic housing for low-to-moderate income older adults\nAssisted living homes that do not provide medical services\nContinuing Care Retirement Communities, which include a range of housing options including independent living\nAdministrators can determine, in collaboration with state and local health officials, whether and how to implement these considerations, making adjustments to meet the unique needs and circumstances of the local community. Implementation should be guided by what is feasible, practical, acceptable, and tailored to the needs of each community. These considerations are meant to supplement\u2014not replace\u2014any state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which retirement communities and independent living facilities must comply.\n\nGuiding Principles to Keep in Mind\nMany people living in retirement communities and independent living facilities are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 because:\n\nRisk increases with age, and/or\nThey may have underlying health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, or lung disease.\nThey also may be at higher risk of getting and spreading the virus because of retirement community and independent living facility characteristics, such as frequent social activities, group dining facilities and other communal spaces, community activities, and shared transportation. The more people a resident or worker interacts with, and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread.\n\nThe risk of COVID-19 spread increases in retirement communities and independent living facilities settings as follows:\n\nLower Risk for this Setting: Residents do not spend time in each other\u2019s individual living spaces, and most communal areas (e.g., cafeteria, activity room) are closed. Workers and residents remain at least 6 feet apart at all times, undergo daily health screenings, and wear masks correctly. Non-essential volunteers and visitors are not permitted.\n\nMore Risk for this Setting: Residents do not spend time in each other\u2019s individual living spaces. Individual residents may use properly ventilated communal areas (e.g., dining room) or participate in small group outdoor activities, but they remain at least 6 feet apart at all times. Workers, residents, volunteers, and visitors remain at least 6 feet apart at all times, undergo daily health screenings, and wear masks correctly. Non-essential volunteers and visitors are permitted, but limited.\n\nHigher Risk for this Setting: Residents spend significant time indoors together, possibly in each other\u2019s living spaces as well as in communal areas. They may not consistently remain at least 6 feet apart, nor wear masks. They also frequently spend time in the larger community (e.g., traveling together to attend public events). Non-essential volunteers and visitors are not restricted.\n\nCOVID-19 is mostly spread by respiratory droplets released when people cough, sneeze, or talk. Someone can also get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own nose, mouth, or possibly their eyes. COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms. Therefore, personal prevention practices (such as frequent handwashing, social distancing, and staying home when sick) and environmental cleaning and disinfection, as well as use of masks are important principles that are covered in this document. Fortunately, there are a number of actions administrators can take to help lower the risk of COVID-19 exposure and spread in their communities and at their facilities.\n\nTop of Page\nPlan and Prepare\nReview, update, and implement emergency operations plans (EOPs).\n\nThe most important thing for administrators of retirement communities and independent living facilities to do now is plan and prepare. No matter the level of transmission in a community, every retirement community and independent living facility should have a plan in place to protect residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors from the spread of COVID-19. This should be done in collaboration with local public health departments, local or state regulatory agencies, and other relevant partners. Focus on components, or annexes, of the plans that address infectious disease outbreaks.\n\nReference key resources while reviewing, updating, and implementing the EOP.\n\nMultiple federal agencies have developed resources on emergency preparedness for older adults before, during, and after possible emergencies. Retirement communities and independent living facilities may find this guidance for developing emergency operations plans helpful.\nThe Administration for Community Living\u2019s Emergency Preparedness webpageexternal icon contains links to free tools and resources on emergency planning and response for older adults and people with disabilities. Use CDC\u2019s Emergency Preparedness for Older Adults to help residents create emergency plans. Additionally, FEMA\u2019s Planning Considerations for Organizations in Reconstituting Operations During the COVID-19 Pandemicexternal icon outlines key considerations for planning to resume operations while protecting the well-being and safety of employees and communities.\nA checklistpdf icon is available for use by long-term care facilities and assisted living facilities to assess and improve their preparedness for responding to COVID-19. Retirement communities and independent living facilities can adapt this checklist to meet their needs and circumstances.\nPlanning strategies include:\n\nInforming residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors about COVID-19. Develop information-sharing systems that are tailored to the needs of your community. For instance, administrators can support residents who have no or limited access to the internet by delivering print materials to their residents. Printable materials for community-based settings are available on the CDC Website.\nPromoting healthy behaviors that reduce spread, maintain healthy environments and operations, and what to do in the event someone gets sick.\nTaking action to prevent or slow the spread of COVID-19 including limiting the number of non-essential visitors to workers, volunteers, and visitors who are essential to preserving the health, including mental health, well-being, and safety of residents.\nConsider identifying residents who have unique medical needs (including behavioral health needs) and encourage them to develop a plan for if they or their primary caregiver(s) become ill.\nPromoting Behaviors that Reduce Spread\nRetirement communities and independent living facilities can use several strategies to encourage behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19.\n\nStaying Home or Self-Isolating when Appropriate\nEducate residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors on when they should stay home or self-isolate in their living quarters.\nActively encourage those who are sick to stay home or in their living quarters.\nResidents, workers, volunteers, and visitors should stay home when they have confirmed or suspected COVID-19.\nThose who have recently had close contact with a person with COVID-19 should also stay home and monitor their health.\nDevelop flexible and non-punitive policies that encourage sick individuals to stay at home without fear of reprisals, and ensure workers are aware of these policies. Offer telework options, if feasible.\nEducate both facility-based workers (including ancillary staff such as dietary, recreational, and environmental services), consultant personnel (e.g., housekeeping, sitter, barber), and volunteers who provide care or services in the facility. Inclusion of consultants in all efforts is important, since they commonly provide care in multiple facilities and can be exposed to COVID-19 or serve as a source of transmission. Workers or volunteers who visit multiple locations should be encouraged to tell facilities if they have had exposure to other facilities with recognized COVID-19 cases.\nCDC\u2019s criteria can help inform when workers should return to work:\nIf they have been sick with COVID-19\nIf they have recently had close contact with a person with COVID-19\nHand Hygiene and Respiratory Etiquette\nRecommend and reinforce handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\nIf soap and water are not readily available, hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% ethanol or 70% isopropanol can be used.\nReinforce handwashing in between interactions with residents as appropriate.\nEncourage covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or use the inside of your elbow. Used tissues should be thrown in the trash and hands washed immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\nMasks \nRecommend and reinforce use of masks among residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors. Masks should be worn whenever feasible and are most essential in times when social distancing is difficult, such as during personal care activities (e.g., cutting hair). Individuals should be frequently reminded not to touch the mask and to wash their hands Information should be provided to all residents, workers, volunteers and visitors on proper use, removal, and washing of masks.\nNote: Masks should not be placed on:\nBabies and children younger than 2 years old\nAnyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious\nAnyone who is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the cover without assistance\nMasks should be worn correctly and washed before reuse.\nResidents with early dementia or other cognitive disabilities living in retirement communities or independent living facilities with a caregiver (e.g., spouse) may require assistance with wearing a mask or even be unable to comply with wearing one properly.\nMasks are meant to protect other people in case the wearer is unknowingly infected but does not have symptoms.\nMasks are not personal protective equipment (PPE) and should NOT be worn by workers instead of a respirator or surgical mask if more than source control is required.\nPersons with symptoms of mental disorders, including anxiety, phobias, or panic attacks, might have trouble breathing using a mask, and this should be avoided. Efforts should be made to eliminate these types of adverse outcomes while still helping the individual utilize CDC recommended COVID-19 prevention strategies like wearing a mask if it is possible and can be done safely.\nA mask is not a substitute for social distancing.\nSocial Distancing\nEncourage social distancing by asking workers, residents, volunteers, and visitors to stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) apart both in common areas and individual residences.\nAdequate Supplies in Common Areas\nSupport healthy hygiene behaviors by providing supplies, including soap, hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, paper towels, tissues, disinfectant wipes, masks (as feasible), and no-touch/foot pedal trash cans.\nSigns and Messages\nPost signs in highly visible locations (e.g., building entrances, restrooms, dining areas) that promote everyday protective measurespdf icon and describe how to stop the spreadpdf icon of germs (such as social distancing, by properly washing hands and properly wearing a maskimage icon).\nBroadcast regular announcements on PA systems in communal areas.\nInclude messages (for example, videos) about behaviors that prevent spread of COVID-19 when communicating with residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors (such as on websites, in emails, in facility newsletters, and on social media accounts).\nFind free CDC print and digital resources on CDC\u2019s communications resources main page.\nIdentify and address potential language, cultural, and environmental barriers associated with communicating COVID-19 information. Consider developing communication materials in alternative formats (e.g., large print, braille, ASL) for people who have low vision or are blind or people who are deaf or hard of hearing.\nConsider developing communication materials at an 8th grade reading level and using plain or easy to understand language.\nCommunications may need to be framed or adapted so they are culturally appropriate for your audience and easy to understand. In addition, there are resources on the CDC website that are in many languages.\nTop of Page\nMaintaining Healthy Environments in Common Areas\nRetirement communities and independent living facilities may consider several strategies to maintain healthy environments.\n\nCleaning and Disinfection\nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (e.g., door handles, handicap door access switches, sink handles, drinking fountains, grab bars, hand railings, bathroom stalls, dining hall tables) within facilities at least daily or between use as much as possible. Use of shared objects (e.g., computer equipment, remote controls, print materials) should be limited when possible, or cleaned and disinfected between use.\nDevelop a schedule for increased, routine cleaning and disinfection.\nEnsure safe and correct use and storage of cleaners and disinfectantsexternal icon, including storing products securely. Use products that meet EPA disinfection criteria according to manufacturer\u2019sexternal icon labeled directions.\nEncourage residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors to keep their personal items (e.g., cell phones, other electronics) and personal work and living spaces clean. Encourage residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors to use disinfectant wipes to wipe down objects and surfaces before use.\nVentilation\nEnsure ventilation systems operate properly and increase circulation of outdoor air as much as possible, for example by opening windows and doors. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk (e.g., risk of falling, triggering asthma symptoms) to residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors using the facility.\nWater Systems\nTo minimize the risk of Legionnaires\u2019 disease and other diseases associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems, water-using devices, and water features (e.g., ice machines, drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged shutdown or reduced operation. Drinking fountains, like all high-touch surfaces, should be cleaned and disinfected, but encourage residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors to bring their own water to minimize use and sharing of water fountains.\nModified Layouts\nAlter schedules to reduce mixing and close contact, such as staggering meal and activity times and forming small groups that regularly participate at the same times and do not mix with individuals in other groups.\nArrange seating of chairs and tables to be least 6 feet apart during shared meals or other events.\nMinimize traffic in enclosed spaces, such as mailrooms, elevators, and stairwells. Consider limiting the number of individuals in an elevator at one time and designating one-directional stairwells, if possible.\nEnsure that social distancing can be maintained in shared rooms, such as television, game, or exercise rooms, or rooms for shared worship services.\nCreate distance between residents in shared vehicles (e.g., skipping rows) when possible.\nPhysical Barriers and Guides\nInstall physical barriers, such as sneeze guards and partitions, particularly in areas where it is difficult for individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart (e.g., reception areas).\nProvide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls to ensure that individuals remain at least 6 feet apart.\nCommunal Spaces\nClose indoor shared spaces such as dining halls, game rooms, computer rooms, exercise rooms, and lounges if needed to ensure safety of the residents. Otherwise, stagger use and restrict the number of people allowed in at one time to ensure everyone can stay at least 6 feet apart, and clean and disinfect between use. Prioritize outdoor activities where possible.\nLimit the presence of non-essential volunteers and visitors in shared areas, when possible.\nAdd physical barriers, such as plastic flexible screens, between bathroom sinks and between beds especially when they cannot be at least 6 feet apart.\nClean and disinfect bathrooms regularly (e.g., in the morning and evening, after times of heavy use) using EPA-registered disinfectantsexternal icon following the manufacturer\u2019s labeled directions.\nConsiderations for specific communal rooms in your facility:\nShared kitchens and dining rooms\nRestrict the number of people allowed in the kitchen and dining room at one time so that everyone can stay at least 6 feet apart from one another.\nPeople who are sick, their household members, and those who have higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 should have prepared meals delivered to and eaten in their residence, if possible.\nDo not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, or eating utensils. Non-disposable food service items used should be handled with gloves and washed with dish soap and hot water or in a dishwasher.Wash hands after handling used food service items.\nUse gloves when removing garbage bags and handling and disposing of trash. After removing gloves, wash hands.\nLaundry rooms\nMaintain access and adequate supplies to laundry facilities. Restrict the number of people allowed in laundry rooms at one time to ensure everyone can stay at least 6 feet apart.\nProvide disposable gloves, soap for washing hands, and household cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectantsexternal iconfor residents and workers to clean and disinfect buttons, knobs, and handles of laundry machines, laundry baskets, and shared laundry items.\nPost guidelinesfor doing laundry such as washing instructions and handling of dirty laundry.\nRecreational areas such as activity rooms and exercise rooms\nConsider closing activity rooms or restricting the number of people allowed in at one time to ensure everyone can stay at least 6 feet apart.\nHold organized activities outdoors, where possible. Consider closing exercise rooms; otherwise, stagger use, increase air flow by opening windows where possible, and clean and disinfect between use.\nActivities and sports (e.g., basketball, chess) that require close contact are not recommended.\nPools and hot tubs\nConsider closing pools and hot tubs or limiting access to pools for essential activities only, such as water therapy. Consider additional prevention activities for public pools, hot tubs, and water playgrounds during COVID-19 for those that remain open.\nWhile proper operation, maintenance, and disinfection (with chlorine or bromine) should kill the virus that causes COVID-19 in pools and hot tubs, they may become crowded, making it difficult to maintain social distance. It can also be challenging to keep surfaces clean and disinfected.\nConsiderations for shared spaces (maintaining social distance and cleaning and disinfecting surfaces) should be addressed for the pool and hot tub area and in locker rooms if they remain open.\nShared bathrooms\nShared bathrooms should be cleaned regularly using EPA-registered disinfectantsexternal icon, at least twice per day (e.g., in the morning and evening or after times of heavy use), and as needed during use.\nMake sure bathrooms are continuously stocked with soap and paper towels. Hand sanitizer could also be made available.\nMake sure trash cans are emptied regularly.\nProvide information on how to wash hands properly. Hang signspdf icon in bathrooms.\nIndividual Spaces\nLimit workers entering residents\u2019 rooms or living quarters unless it is necessary. Use virtual communications and check ins (phone or video chat), as appropriate.\nReinforce handwashing by workers in between entering resident\u2019s living quarters.\nIf soap and water are not readily available, hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol can be used.\nConsider limiting the presence of non-essential volunteers and visitors (e.g., one visitor per resident per day).\nFood Service\nMinimize the number of people allowed in the kitchen, food prep area, or dining area to allow for social distancing of at least 6 feet.\nProvide grab-and-go options for meals. If a cafeteria or group dining room is typically used, if possible, serve individually plated meals (versus buffet or any self-serve stations). Offer meal delivery, if feasible.\nUse disposable food service items (e.g., utensils, dishes). If disposable items are not feasible or desirable, ensure that all non-disposable food service items are handled with gloves and washed with dish soap and hot water or in a dishwasher. Individuals should wash their handsafter removing their gloves or after directly handling used food service items.\nIf food is offered at any event, have pre-packaged boxes or bags for each attendee instead of a buffet or family-style meal. Avoid sharing food and utensils and consider the safety of individuals with food allergies.pdf icon\nShared Objects\nDiscourage people from sharing items that are difficult to clean or disinfect (e.g., puzzles, game pieces).\nEnsure adequate supplies to minimize sharing of high-touch materials to the extent possible, or limit use of supplies and equipment to one group of residents at a time and clean and disinfect between use.\nAvoid sharing electronic devices, books, pens, and other devices or aids.\nTop of Page\nMaintaining Healthy Operations\nRetirement communities and independent living facilities may consider different strategies to maintain healthy operations.\n\nProtections for Residents, Workers, Volunteers, and Visitors at Higher Risk for Severe Illness from COVID-19\nOffer options for those at higher risk for severe illness (including older adults and people of all ages with certain underlying medical conditions) that limit their exposure risk (e.g., telework, modified job responsibilities, virtual participation in community events).\nConsistent with applicable law, put in place policies to protect the privacy of people at higher risk for severe illness regarding underlying medical conditions.\nRegulatory Awareness\nBe aware of local or state regulatory agency policies related to group gatherings or outings to determine if events or activities can be held.\nGatherings\nIdentify services and activities (e.g., meal programs, religious services, and exercise rooms and programs) that might need to be limited, adapted, or temporarily discontinued. Consider alternative solutions (e.g., virtual services) that will help programs continue while being safe for participants.\nPursue virtual group events, gatherings, or meetings, if possible, and promote social distancing of at least 6 feet between people if events are held. Limit group size to the extent possible.\nLimit gathering attendance to workers, volunteers, and visitors who are essential to preserving the health, including mental health, well-being, and safety of residents. Limit attendance of individuals who are not from the local area (e.g., community, town, city, county).\nTelework and Virtual Meetings\nEncourage telework for as many workers as possible, especially employees at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.\nReplace in-person meetings with video- or tele-conference calls whenever possible.\nProvide support services virtually, as feasible.\nTravel and Transit\nConsider options for limiting non-essential travel in accordance with state and local regulations and guidance.\nEncourage individuals who are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19, such as older adults, people with disabilities, and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions, to limit travel.\nIf providing transportation, consider cohorting residents (keeping small groups together) to limit mixing, and create distance between passengers on buses/vans and other transport vehicles (e.g., skip rows) when possible.\nIf transport vehicles (e.g., buses/vans) are used, drivers should practice all safety actions and protocols as indicated for other workers (e.g., hand hygiene, masks). To clean and disinfect buses or other transport vehicles, see guidance for bus transit operators.\nEncourage residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors who use public transportation to consider using forms of transportation that minimize close contact with others (e.g., walking, biking, driving or riding by car\u2014alone or with household or facility aging services members only) if feasible. Encourage residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors who use public transportation to follow CDC guidance on how to protect yourself when using transportation.\nDesignated COVID-19 Point of Contact\nDesignate a staff member to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns. All residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors should know who this person is and how to contact them (see \u201csigns and messages\u201d).\nCommunication Systems\nPut systems in place for:\nHaving residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors file a report to the facility if they have symptoms of COVID-19, a positive test for COVID-19, or were exposed to someone with COVID-19 within the last 14 days in accordance with health information sharing regulations for COVID-19 external icon(e.g., see \u201cNotify Health Officials and Close Contacts\u201d in the Preparing for When Someone Gets Sick section below).\nNotifying residents and families, and the public of any restrictions in place to limit exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19 (e.g., limitations of visitors).\nEducating residents and families including with information about COVID-19; actions the facility is taking to protect them and/or their loved ones, including visitor restrictions; and actions they can take to protect themselves in the facility, emphasizing the importance of staying home when sick, social distancing, hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette, and wearing a mask.\nLeave (Time Off) and Excused Absence Policies\nImplement flexible, non-punitive sick leave policies and practices that enable workers to stay home or self-isolate when they are sick or caring for someone who is sick.\nExamine and revise policies for excused absences and leave, telework, and employee compensation.\nLeave policies should be flexible and not punish people for taking time off, and should allow sick employees to stay home and away from others. Leave and excused absence policies should also account for employees who need to stay home with their children if there are school or childcare closures, or to care for sick family members.\nDevelop policies for returning to activities and facilities after COVID-19 illness. CDC\u2019s criteria to discontinue home isolation and quarantine can inform these policies.\nBack-Up Staffing Plan\nMonitor absenteeism of workers and volunteers, cross-train workers, and create a roster of trained back-up staff.\nWorker Training\nTrain workers and volunteers on everyday preventive behaviors and all safety protocols.\nConduct training virtually or ensure that social distancing is maintained during training.\nRecognize Signs and Symptoms\nSymptoms of COVID-19 can range from mild symptoms to severe illness and death. Symptoms may appear 2\u201314 days after exposure.\u202fWatch for fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms (chills, headache, muscle pain, sore throat, new loss of taste or smell, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea). These symptoms might not be the same in every person.\nIn some cases, fever or other symptoms can take longer to develop in older adults and people of any age with underlying health conditions.\nIn older adults, normal body temperature can be lower than in younger adults (closer to 97\u00b0F than 98.6\u00b0F). Fever temperatures can be lower in older adults.\nIf feasible, conduct daily health checks or ask residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors to conduct self-checks (e.g., temperature screening and/or symptom checking).\nHealth checks should be done safely and respectfully, and in accordance with any applicable privacy laws and regulations. Facility administrators may use examples of screening methods in CDC\u2019s General Business FAQs.\nWorkers and volunteers should be advised that if they develop a fever or symptoms of respiratory infection while at work, they should immediately put on a mask (if appropriate) if not already wearing one, inform their supervisor, and leave the workplace.\nSharing Facilities \nEncourage any organizations that share or use the facilities to also follow these considerations, and limit or temporarily stop shared use, if feasible.\nAccepting New Residents\nFirst, review and follow the guidance and directives from your state and local officials. If your situation is not restricted by their guidance and directives, then consider the following guidance:\nAt check-in, provide any new or potential resident with a clean mask and keep them isolated from others.\nMedical evaluation may be necessary depending on the symptoms.\nIf your facility is full, your facility space is inadequate to maintain social distancing, or you do not have the resources (staff, prevention supplies) to accept additional residents, reach out to community- or faith-based organizations to help meet individuals\u2019 needs, including:\nA safe place to stay\nAbility to obtain basic necessities, such as food, personal hygiene products, and medicine\nAccess to any needed medical or behavioral health services\nAccess to a phone or a device with internet access to seek out resources and virtual services and support\nSupporting Residents\nSuggest that residents keep up-to-date lists of medical conditions and medications, and periodically check to ensure they have a sufficient supply of their prescription and over-the-counter medications.\nIf possible, help residents understand they can contact their healthcare provider to ask about getting extra necessary medications to have on hand for a longer period of time, or to consider using a mail-order option for medications.\nMake sure that residents are aware of serious symptoms of their underlying conditions and of COVID-19 symptoms that require emergency care, and that they know who to ask for help and when to call 911.\nEncourage residents who live alone to seek out a \u201cbuddy\u201d in the community who will check on them and safely make sure they are getting basic necessities, including food and household essentials.\nSupport Coping and Resilience \nSupport residents\u2019 efforts to stay connected with their families and loved ones, such as through:\nFrequent video chats, emails, text messages, and phone calls.\nRecorded video messages to share via email or text message, if live-video chatting is not feasible.\nCards and letters with messages of support and updates on family members.\nEncourage workers and residents to take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories, including social media, if they are feeling overwhelmed or distressed.\nPromote workers and residents eating healthy, exercising, getting sleep, and finding time to unwind.\nEncourage workers and residents to talk with people they trust about their concerns and how they are feeling.\nAcknowledge that workers may experience elevated levels of stress during this time. Provide resources on coping with stress and encourage workers to seek help through their healthcare provider if stress gets in the way of their daily activities for several days in a row.\nConsider posting signage for the national distress hotline: 1-800-985-5990, or text TalkWithUsto 66746.\nTop of Page\nPreparing for When Someone Gets Sick\nRetirement communities and independent living facilities may consider different strategies to prepare for when someone gets sick.\n\nAdvise Sick Individuals of Home Isolation Criteria\nSick workers should not return to the facilities or end isolation until they have met CDC\u2019s criteria to discontinue home isolation.\nHave ill residents seek advice by telephone from a healthcare provider to determine whether medical evaluation is needed.\nResidents are not required to notify administrators if they have a confirmed case of COVID-19. If you receive information that someone in your facility has COVID-19, you should work with the local health departmentexternal icon to notify anyone in the building who may have been exposed (had close contact with the person who is ill) while maintaining the confidentiality of the ill person as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADAexternal icon) and, if applicable, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).external icon\nProvide the ill person with information on how to care for themselves and when to seek medical attention.\nEncourage residents with COVID-19 symptoms and their household members and close contacts to self-isolate \u2013 limit their use of shared spaces as much as possible.\nIf possible, designate a separate bathroom for residents with COVID-19 symptoms.\nConsider reducing cleaning frequency in bedrooms and bathrooms dedicated to persons with COVID-19 symptoms to as-needed cleaning (e.g., soiled items and surfaces) to avoid unnecessary contact with the ill persons or soiled items.\nFollow guidance on when to stop isolation.\nMinimize the number of workers who have face-to-face interactions with residents who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19.\nEncourage caregivers who visit persons with COVID-19 symptoms to follow recommended precautions to prevent the spread.\nWorkers at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 should not have close contact with residents who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19.\nThose who have been in close contact with a resident who has confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should monitor their health and call their healthcare provider if they develop symptoms suggestive of COVID-19.\nIsolate and Transport Those Who Are Sick\nEarly implementation of stringent isolation and protective measures after identification of COVID-19 cases may be effective in minimizing spread of the virus. Immediately separate residents, workers, volunteers, or visitors with COVID-19 symptoms (such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath). Individuals who are sick should go home or to a healthcare facility, depending on how severe their symptoms are, and follow CDC Guidance for caring for oneself and others who are sick. Facilities may follow CDC\u2019s Guidance for Shared or Congregate Housing for those that live in facility housing.\nWork with facility administrators and healthcare providers to identify an isolation room, area, or building/floor (depending on the facility or community structure) to separate anyone who has COVID-19 symptoms or tests positive but does not have symptoms. Facility healthcare providers should use Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions when caring for sick people. See: What Healthcare Personnel Should Know About Caring for Patients with Confirmed or Possible COVID-19 Infection.\nIdentify a list of healthcare facilities and alternative care sites where residents with COVID-19 can receive appropriate care, if needed.\nEstablish procedures for safely transporting anyone who is sick to their home or to a healthcare facility. If calling an ambulance or bringing someone to the hospital, alert them that the person may have COVID-19.\nMake sure that workers, volunteers, and visitors know they should not come to the facility if they are sick, and should notify facility officials (e.g., facility designated COVID-19 point of contact) if they become sick with COVID-19 symptoms, test positive for COVID-19, or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 symptoms or a confirmed or suspected case.\nClean and Disinfect\nClose off areas used by a sick person and do not use these areas until after cleaning and disinfecting\nWait at least 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible. Ensure safe and correct use and storage of cleaningexternal icon and disinfection products.\nNotify Health Officials and Close Contacts\nIn accordance with state and local laws and regulations, retirement communities and independent living facilities should notify local health officials, residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors of cases of COVID-19 while maintaining confidentiality in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)external icon.\nInform those who have had close contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19 to stay home or in their living quarters and self-monitor for symptoms, and follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop.",

            "HeadLine": "Managing Investigations During an Outbreak",
            "Text": "Most jurisdictions will create a special investigation team to take over outbreaks as they require expertise and resources beyond typical case investigation and contact tracing efforts. CDC has developed specific guidance for investigating clients with COVID-19 in a number of settings. When relevant, the CDC guidance is highlighted below.\n\nA COVID-19 outbreak indicates potentially extensive transmission within a setting or organization. An outbreak investigation involves several overlapping epidemiologic, case, and contact investigations, with a surge in the need for public health resources. More emphasis on active case finding is recommended, which can result in more contacts than usual needing testing and monitoring.\n\nDefinitions for COVID-19 outbreaks are relative to the local context.  A working definition of \u201coutbreak\u201d is recommended for planning investigations. A recommended definition is a situation that is consistent with either of two sets of criteria:\n\nDuring (and because of) a case investigation and contact tracing, two or more contacts are identified as having active COVID-19, regardless of their assigned priority.\nOR\n\nTwo or more patients with COVID-19 are discovered to be linked, and the linkage is established outside of a case investigation and contact tracing (e.g., two patients who received a diagnosis of COVID-19 are found to work in the same office, and only one or neither of the them was listed as a contact to the other).\nTypically, jurisdictions will require potential outbreaks to be investigated by a special team of experts. An outbreak increases the urgency of investigations and places greater demands on the health department. In an outbreak, contacts can be exposed to more than one patient diagnosed with COVID-19, and patients and contacts can be interrelated through multiple social connections, which complicate efforts to set priorities.\n\nCongregate Settings\nFor congregate settings, the types of information for designating priorities are site-specific, and therefore a customized algorithm is required for each situation. The general concepts of patient characteristics, duration and proximity of exposure, environmental factors that affect transmission, and susceptibility of contacts to COVID-19 should be considered. These investigations are extremely complex and will require collaboration with multiple partners in order to assess risk for both facility residents, staff, and external contractors who provide services in those facilities. Symptom screening, testing, and isolation and quarantine recommended may vary based on the facility (e.g., healthcare facility versus others), the environmental constructs, and the number of patients with COVID-19 and contacts under consideration.\n\nIn some instances, case investigation and contact tracing conducted within facilities will need to be undertaken by specially trained staff (e.g., infection control practitioners, industrial hygienists) in collaboration with facility leadership, occupational health liaisons and other relevant SMEs. Interruption of transmission within the facilities will also require complementary community case investigation and contact tracing efforts, so planning for these activities should be a joint endeavor involving community leadership and other key stakeholders.\n\nThe information below provides a snapshot of areas for consideration and links to available CDC guidance. In addition, CDC has guidance for health departments that are conducting testing in the community.\n\nCorrectional Facilities\nCDC has issued guidance on preventing and controlling COVID-19 in correctional facilities. Jails, prisons, and immigrant detention centers have reported COVID-19 outbreaks. Multiple factors can hinder contact tracing in correctional facilities. The best preparation for conducting case investigation and contact tracing in jails, prisons, and immigration centers is a preexisting formal collaboration between correctional and public health officials. Health department TB, HIV, and STD programs have long-standing relationships with correctional facilities and can be seen as a resource. If a collaboration has not been established prior to an outbreak, quickly developing relationships with correctional partners will be critical. Building trust with people held in the facilities will also be necessary to successfully investigate the outbreak.\n\nInvestigations in jails can be particularly challenging because of rapid turnover of inmates and crowding. The number of contacts in close proximity to a patient/inmate can be large. Contacts who are transferred, released, or paroled from a correctional facility before being evaluated for COVID-19 should be traced.\n\nTop of Page\nWorkplaces\nCDC has resources for businesses and workplaces, including guidance on how to prevent COVID-19 in the workplace. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also provides COVID-19 prevention and control guidanceexternal icon for workers and employers. Duration and proximity of exposure can be greater than for other settings. Details regarding employment, hours, working conditions, and workplace contacts should be obtained during the initial interview with the patient, and the workplace should be toured after accounting for confidentiality and permission from workplace administrators or managers. If the employer has occupational health professionals/program, they should be included in the walkthrough and engaged throughout the investigative process.\n\nEmployee lists are helpful for identifying contacts, but certain employees might have left the workplace and thus been omitted from current employee lists. Also consider contractual personnel who may not be on workplace rosters but could also be exposed (e.g., housekeeping, cafeteria, business associates for meetings/conference, etc.). Investigators need to be aware of the sensitivities surrounding the immigration status of workers and how this can be a barrier to case investigation and contact tracing activities.\n\nWorkplace administrators or managers are likely to express concern regarding liability, lost productivity, sick leave policies, responsibility for testing and screening, and media coverage. In addition, there should be efforts to protect patient confidentiality. Many of these issues can be addressed during planning. For example, the assistance of the health department\u2019s media relations specialist can be offered to the workplace. For questions of liability and requirements under law, discussions between the health department\u2019s and the workplace\u2019s legal counsels are recommended. Unions may also be engaged and have concerns about worker safety and other issues.\n\nMultiple outbreaks of COVID-19 among meat and poultry processing facility workers have occurred in the United States. CDC and OSHA provide guidance for meat and poultry processing workers and employers.\n\nHospitals and Other Healthcare Settings\nNearly every type of healthcare setting has been impacted by transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and guidance on preventing transmission has been provided by CDC and by OSHAexternal icon. State governments have different degrees of regulatory authority over healthcare settings. Personnel collaborating with hospitals and other healthcare entities should have knowledge of applicable legal requirements.\n\nNursing homes and other long-term care facilities (LTCF) have been especially vulnerable to COVID-19 outbreaks. Recent experience with outbreaks in nursing homes has also reinforced that residents with COVID-19 may not be willing or able to report typical symptoms such as fever or respiratory symptoms; some may not report any symptoms. CDC has guidance on how LTCF and nursing homes can be prepared to prevent COVID-19. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) also provides guidanceexternal icon for nursing homes.\n\nInfection control practitioners may or may not be familiar with COVID-19 case investigations and contact tracing. An investigation should be planned jointly as a collaboration between the facility and the health department, including the facility\u2019s occupational health services and infection protection and control staff. Initial discussions should cover data sharing and division of responsibilities.\n\nIn healthcare settings, there may be unique concerns about liability, confidentiality, media coverage, and occupational hazards. OSHAexternal icon has guidance to assist employers in understanding the agency\u2019s requirements.  OSHA\u2019s regulations might require hospital administrators to report when employees have been diagnosed with COVID-19 from occupational exposure. Note:  Twenty-two states operate individual plansexternal icon covering both private sector and state and local government workers. Public health officials should consider inviting legal counsel to the initial planning sessions with healthcare administrators.\n\nSchools and Child Care Settings\nThis category includes childcare centers, preschools, primary through secondary schools, vocational schools that replace or immediately follow secondary school, and colleges and universities. CDC  issued guidance for administrators of public and private child care programs and K-12 schools, as well as guidance for administrators of public and private institutions of higher education (IHE) and guidance for child care programs that remain open.\n\nDuring an outbreak in these settings, a coordinated investigation that includes communication and collaborative decision making with education agencies and parents can increase the efficiency and success of the process. Consent, assent, and disclosure of information are more complex for non-emancipated minors than for adults. Each interaction with a minor is also a potential interaction with the family. The health department typically has limited alternatives for evaluating a minor if permission is not granted. Anticipatory legal consultation is recommended.\n\nThe presence of COVID-19 in schools often generates publicity. Ideally, the health department should transparently communicate with the school and parents/guardians. Public health officials should anticipate media coverage and plan a collaborative strategy.\n\nPublic health officials should consider whether extramural activities add other exposure sites and contacts. Clubs, sports, and certain classes require the case investigator to obtain additional information when interviewing the client, the client\u2019s parents/guardians, and school personnel. For clients with COVID-19 who ride school buses, a bus company might keep a roster of riders with addresses.\n\nThe strategy for case investigation and contact tracing in child care centers, preschools, and primary schools depends on whether the person diagnosed with COVID-19 is a child or an adult (e.g., a teacher or caregiver). In a case investigation of a child aged <5 years who has COVID-19 and who attends preschool or child care, all adults in these settings should be included if the source of the child\u2019s infection has not been located in the family or household. Certain home-based child care centers include adults who do not provide child care but still share space or interact with the children.\n\nSchool breaks, vacations, graduations, and transfers can disrupt the case investigation and contact tracing. In collaboration with school officials, the health department can notify students and other contacts who will be unavailable at the school. These contacts should be referred for testing.\n\nShelters and Other Settings Providing Services for People Experiencing Homelessness\nCDC has guidance on how to investigate potential cases of COVID-19 among people living in a homeless shelter or living in an unsheltered situation. In addition, CDC has provided guidance for homeless service providers to plan and respond to COVID-19.",

Healthcare personnel (HCP) should follow CDC\u2019s Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Work Restrictions for Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure to COVID-19 regarding work restrictions if they have potential exposure to people with COVID-19. However, such HCP should also follow this Guidance for Community-Related Exposure for what to do in the community. See also CDC\u2019s guidance for Implementing Safety Practices for Critical Infrastructure Workers Who May Have Had Exposure to a Person with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19. Individuals should always follow guidance of the state and local authorities.\n\nPublic health recommendations have been updated to accommodate new scientific evidence, evolving epidemiology, and the need to simplify risk assessment. New recommendations are based on:\n\nGrowing evidence of transmission risk from infected people without symptoms (asymptomatic) or before the onset of recognized symptoms (presymptomatic);\nIncreased community transmission in many parts of the country;\nA need to communicate effectively to the general public;\nContinued focus on reducing transmission through social distancing and other personal prevention strategies.\nSummary of Changes:\n\nOn June 4, 2020\n\nAdded exposure to people with confirmed COVID-19 who have not had any symptoms to this Guidance.\nCurrent guidance based on community exposure, for people exposed to people with known or suspected COVID-19 or possible COVID-19\n\n\n\nCurrent guidance based on community exposure, for asymptomatic persons exposed to persons with known or suspected COVID-19 or possible COVID-19\nPerson\tExposure to\tRecommended Precautions for the Public\nIndividual who has had close contact (< 6 feet)** for \u226515 minutes***\nPerson with COVID-19 who has symptoms (in the period from 2 days before symptom onset until they meet criteria for discontinuing home isolation; can be laboratory-confirmed or a clinically compatible illness)\nPerson who has tested positive for COVID-19 (laboratory confirmed) but has not had any symptoms (in the 2 days before the date of specimen collection until they meet criteria for discontinuing home isolation).\nNote: This is irrespective of whether the person with COVID-19 or the contact was wearing a mask or whether the contact was wearing respiratory personal protective equipment (PPE)\n\nStay home until 14 days after last exposure and maintain social distance (at least 6 feet) from others at all times\nSelf-monitor for symptoms\nCheck temperature twice a day\nWatch for fever*, cough, or shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19\nAvoid contact with people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19\nFollow CDC guidance if symptoms develop\nAll U.S. residents, other than those with a known risk exposure\t\nPossible unrecognized COVID-19 exposures in U.S. communities\nPractice social distancing and other personal prevention strategies\nBe alert for symptoms\nWatch for fever*, cough, or shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19\nCheck temperature if symptoms develop\nFollow CDC guidance if symptoms develop\n*For the purpose of this guidance, fever is defined as subjective fever (feeling feverish) or a measured temperature of 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) or higher. Note that fever may be intermittent or may not be present in some people, such as those who are elderly, immunocompromised, or taking certain fever-reducing medications (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDS]).\n\n** Data to inform the definition of close contact are limited. Factors to consider when defining close contact include proximity, the duration of exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk), and whether the exposure was to a person with symptoms (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure risk). While research indicates masks may help those who are infected from spreading the infection, there is less information regarding whether masks offer any protection for a contact exposed to a symptomatic or asymptomatic patient. Therefore, the determination of close contact should be made irrespective of whether the person with COVID-19 or the contact was wearing a mask. Because the general public has not received training on proper selection and use of respiratory PPE, it cannot be certain whether respiratory PPE worn during contact with an individual with COVID-19 infection protected them from exposure.\u202fTherefore, as a conservative approach, the determination of close contact should generally be made irrespective of whether the contact was wearing respiratory PPE, which is recommended for health care personnel and other trained users, or a mask recommended for the general public.\n\n***Data are insufficient to precisely define the duration of time that constitutes a prolonged exposure. Recommendations vary on the length of time of exposure, but 15 minutes of close exposure can be used as an operational definition. Brief interactions are less likely to result in transmission; however, symptoms and the type of interaction (e.g., did the infected person cough directly into the face of the exposed individual) remain important.",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) models show that when individuals who are tested for the virus are separated from others and placed in quarantine, there can be up to an 86 percent reduction in the transmission of the virus compared to a 40 percent decrease in viral transmission if the person isolates after symptoms arise.\n\nProvider counseling to patients, at the time of their COVID-19 testing, will include the discussion of immediate need for isolation, even before results are available, the importance to inform their immediate household that they too should be tested for COVID-19, and the review of signs and symptoms and services available to them to aid in isolating at home.  In addition, they will be counseled that if they test positive, to wear a mask at all times and they will be contacted by public health authorities and asked to provide information for contact tracing and to tell their immediate household and recent contacts in case it is appropriate for these individuals to be tested for the virus and to self-isolate as well.\n\nCMS will use existing evaluation and management (E/M) payment codes to reimburse providers who are eligible to bill CMS for counseling services no matter where a test is administered, including doctor\u2019s offices, urgent care clinics, hospitals and community drive-thru or pharmacy testing sites.",

            "Text": "Key Terms\nRelief Healthcare Facilities (RHFs): Established licensed healthcare facilities (e.g., hospitals, long-term acute care hospitals, long-term care facilities, and other licensed inpatient healthcare facilities) that accept patient transfers or share extra resources to extend conventional standards of care to as many people as possible during a crisis and therefore minimize the use of crisis standards of care.\n\nCrisis Standards of Care: Standards of care that reflect a substantial change in usual healthcare operations and the level of care that healthcare providers are capable of delivering during a crisis. When a state government formally declares the need for crisis standards of care, this formal declaration enables specific legal/regulatory powers and protections for healthcare providers as they perform the necessary tasks of allocating and using scarce medical resources and adopting alternate healthcare operations during a crisis.\n\nMedical Operations Coordination Cell (MOCC): A cell (group of medical operations experts) within emergency operations centers (EOCs) at the sub-state regional, state-wide, and federal regional levels that can assist in the transferring of patients between healthcare facilities. A MOCC makes data-and stakeholder-informed decisions to balance patient load and ensure high-quality care. MOCC decisions direct the movement of patients and resources from one facility to another or re-direct referrals of patients who would usually go to an overwhelmed facility or system to one that has the capacity to care for those patients.\n\nWhy This Guidance Is Needed\nMany COVID-19 cases are geographically localized and can overwhelm local healthcare facilities. This means that healthcare systems typically have uneven distribution of COVID-19 cases, with some regions\u2019 healthcare systems experiencing patient surges while others have excess capacity for patient care. When healthcare facilities reach or exceed patient capacity, crisis standards of careexternal icon are often implemented. Healthcare systems entering crisis standards of care are faced with the tremendous challenge of providing high-quality care while allocating scarce resources.\n\nWho This Guidance Is For\nThis guidance is for state and local emergency medical planners and all healthcare facilities, especially facilities in rural areas. This guidance outlines considerations around the transfer of patients, staff, and supplies between healthcare facilities to optimize patient care, balance resources, and minimize use of crisis care standards. One strategy is to identify relief healthcare facilities and either establish a federal, state, or regional Medical Operation Coordination Cell (MOCC) or coordinate with an existing MOCC. This guidance offers considerations for jurisdictions around patient safety and relief healthcare facility operations. Specific guidance related to the implementation of the elements highlighted in this guidance can be found in the Federal MOCC Toolkitpdf iconexternal icon.\n\nTop of Page\nKey Considerations for States\nMany states and regions have drawn upon years of experience responding to past public health emergencies as they coordinate healthcare, public health, and emergency medical systems in response to COVID-19.  One advantage of a coordinated approach is monitoring for resource-straining surges of patients and identifying facilities with available beds, staff, and supplies.\n\nTo optimize care for patients, some states designate facilities with available beds and staff as relief healthcare facilities (RHFs). RHFs are established licensed healthcare facilities (e.g., hospitals, long-term acute care hospitals, long-term care facilities, and other licensed inpatient healthcare facilities) that accept patient transfers or share extra resources to extend conventional standards of care to as many people as possible during a crisis and therefore minimize the use of crisis standards of care.\n\nThe Federal Medical Operations Coordination Cells (MOCCs) Toolkitpdf iconexternal icon offers flexible guidance to help regional, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments improve surge capacity and resource allocation across the healthcare delivery system during the COVID-19 pandemic.1,2> The toolkit provides a framework for states or local jurisdictions to establish RHFs. The primary goals for states identifying RHFs are:\n\nProviding the appropriate level of medical care.\nProtecting healthcare personnel and non-COVID-19 patients from infection.\nPreparing for a potential surge in patients with respiratory infection.\nPreparing for shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and staffing.\nTop of Page\nElements Needed for Use of Relief Healthcare Facilities\nThe following guidance is for state and local emergency medical planners and all healthcare facilities, especially facilities in rural areas, planning to identify RHFs, establish a MOCC, or coordinate with an existing MOCC. Guidance, tools, and resources for many of these factors can be found in the MOCC toolkitpdf iconexternal icon.\n\nRegional Coordination\n\nCentralized decision-making must occur at the regional, state, or health system level.\nWork with MOCCspdf iconexternal icon,1,2 local and state public health organizations, healthcare coalitions, and other local partners to understand the impact and spread of the COVID-19 outbreak in your area and any modifications in ongoing initiatives being implemented.\nEnsure that emergency medical service (EMS) agency licensure and resource capabilities are included in local and regional planning efforts. Identify ground and aeromedical transport assets to support patient transfers and develop processes for interfacility transport.\nIf RHFs are to be used across state lines, the healthcare systems and both states should be engaged for joint planning.\nDevelop plans to ensure closed healthcare facilities near RHFs can rapidly and safely re-open if there is a patient surge in surrounding areas.\nPatients suitable for transfer should have their information entered into a central, secure database for tracking, triage, and placement.\nCommunicate information about patients to appropriate personnel before transferring them to another healthcare facility.\nMOCCs and coordinating healthcare facilities should ensure healthcare expenditures will be appropriately covered before transferring patients.3,4,5,6\nAccepting facilities should review and accept patients based on:\nthe RHF\u2019s ability to provide appropriate standards of care;\ndistance from the patient\u2019s current healthcare facility; and\nthe patient\u2019s level of clinical stability.\nPPE and personnel should be tracked in a centralized system:\nCentralized decision makers should review regularly the HHS Protect Hospital Capacity Dataexternal icon dashboard, data from long-term care facilities reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), and other data sources to ensure that patients and ventilators are placed appropriately and that accepting facilities can manage increases in patient volume.\nRelief Healthcare Facility Resources and Capacity\nEnsure that RHFs have all legal documentation and infrastructural requirement needed to rapidly re-open, if closed.\nEnsure that RHFs have an adequate number of trained healthcare professionals, sufficient space to accommodate additional patients, appropriate PPE, and other equipment and supplies to care for these patients.\nRHFs must be able to accept transfers from highly impacted hospitals and other healthcare facilities without compromising their ability to respond to surges in their own communities.\nRelief hospitals must be able to provide:\na critical care bed for a patient with COVID-19 requiring critical care, including mechanical ventilation;\na critical care bed for a patient without COVID-19 requiring critical care, including mechanical ventilation;\na non-critical care bed for a patient with COVID-19;\na non-critical care bed for a patient without COVID-19; and\na swing bed for long-term recovery, if relief hospitals lack critical care capacity.\nSome rural facilities may have limited capacity to accommodate clinically complex patients and may be more appropriate for non-critical patient care or care of patients without COVID-19. Relief hospitals must be able to provide critical care capability on site if they are accepting patients with a high risk of decompensation who may need to be transferred to higher levels of care if their condition deteriorates quickly.1\nRelief skilled nursing homes should declare their willingness to accept both patients with and without COVID-19 and their willingness to accept stable patients requiring long-term mechanical ventilation and considered appropriate for skilled nursing home level of care.2,3\nRelief long-term care facilities should be willing to accept stable patients requiring mechanical ventilation considered appropriate for long-term care.\nEnsure RHFs use strategies to ensure workers\u2019 safety and support, including healthcare personnel monitoring and operational planning.\nEnsure healthcare facilities, including RHFs and other facilities treating patients with COVID-19, submit capacity data to HHS Protect using one of the approved mechanisms described in the HHS COVID-19 Guidance for Hospital Reporting and FAQsexternal icon.\nConsider if cohorting patients and healthcare personnel may be feasible or useful (i.e., entire facilities or units for patients with COVID-19 or non-COVID-19), including post-discharge planning for patients who are going from hospitals to long-term care or other types of healthcare facilities.\nEnsure all RHFs are prepared to safely triage and manage patients with respiratory illness, including COVID-19. Ensure they become familiar with infection prevention and control guidance for managing patients with COVID-19 and preparation steps.\nEnsure RHFs plan to optimize the supply of PPE in the event of shortages and identify flexible mechanisms to procure additional supplies when needed.\nTop of Page\nInterfacility and Patient Communication\nAll planning efforts for RHFs should adhere to regulations and standards for informed consentexternal icon regarding patient transfers between facilities. The MOCC toolkit provides informed consent form templates.\nConsider whether and what legal documentation may be necessary to facilitate patient transfers.\nEnsure communication between healthcare professionals at the transferring and receiving facilities, with an accurate clinical description of the patients and with clear acceptance by the RHF.\nTelehealth consults with the RHFs should be considered, as needed, for patient management. 10\nThe receiving facility\u2019s policies on visitors should be communicated to family members and healthcare powers of attorney.\nAdditional Resources\nTen Ways Healthcare Systems Can Operate Effectively during the COVID-19 Pandemic\nUsing Telehealth Services\nSPOTLIGHT:  Texas implements a Regional Medical Operations Coordinating Center\nTexas used the existing regional trauma system as a stable framework for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Texas further strengthened this framework and response efforts by linking existing public health, acute healthcare, and disaster management systems to MOCCs. The state\u2019s experience demonstrates the benefits of having established systems for public health and disaster response.\n\nAccelerated Problem-Solving\nTexas\u2019s system enabled and facilitated timely action by:\n\nStructuring cooperation across the state.\nSupporting robust and redundant communications.\nDelivering actionable data.\nBuilding on this existing response framework, Texas implemented performance improvement processes to adapt the system to the response and achieve the best patient outcomes.\n\nThe Role of Regional MOCCs\nThe Regional MOCC bolstered the framework created by Texas\u2019s trauma system by:\n\nProviding situational awareness.\nSupporting integration of public health, acute health care, and disaster management functions.\nProviding actionable data from consolidating public health and acute health care data sources.\nCoordinating healthcare delivery in hot spots.\nManaging drive-through testing.\nBalancing staff workload across health systems and organizations.\nEnsuring safe and high-quality patient care by transferring within the system where care was optimal.\nTop of Page\nSPOTLIGHT:  Michigan\u2019s response to extreme surge in southeast regions\nIn mid-March, Michigan began to experience a significant spread of COVID-19 in the southeast region and metropolitan Detroit area \u2013 with peak hospitalizations of greater than 4,400. The Michigan Healthcare Preparedness Program quickly put into place a surge strategy that optimized the use of healthcare resources to save lives. A key piece of this strategy was using relief hospitals to extend healthcare to residents in need. Although Michigan encountered staff recruitment challenges for hospitals in minimally impacted regions, willingness of these hospitals to accept patients improved following requests from senior state leadership to hospital chief executive officers. The state\u2019s experience demonstrates the importance of monitoring statewide hospital status and facilitating direct connections between hospitals.\n\nExtending Conventional Standards of Care\nMichigan was able to implement the relief hospital concept using the following effective strategies:\n\nDuring a 20-day period (April 1\u201320, 2020), nearly 1,000 patients were transferred between hospitals. About 85% of these patients were transferred through direct interhospital contact, and about 30% were transferred within healthcare systems.\n\nThe Role of Regional and State MOCCs\nMichigan prioritized a facilitative role by establishing and supporting:\n\nA state MOCC operated by experienced paramedics in an EMS dispatch control center.\nPhysician resources for consultation, problem-solving, and medical leadership.\nA statewide hospital status application, was an invaluable tool for identifying relief hospitals and facilitating transfers.",

            "HeadLine": "Operational Considerations for Infection Prevention and Control in Outpatient Facilities: non-U.S. Healthcare Settings",
            "Text": "1. Background\nThis document outlines strategies for implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC) guidance for non-U.S. outpatient care settings in response to community spread of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Clinics and facilities that provide outpatient services play an important role in a healthcare system\u2019s response to COVID-19 and are critical to provide continued essential health services. This information complements available IPC guidanceexternal icon for COVID-19.\n\n2. Target Audience\nThese operational considerations are intended to be used by healthcare facilities and public health authorities in non-U.S. healthcare settings. Outpatient facilities can include community health centers, hospital-based outpatient clinics, non-hospital-based clinics, physician offices, alternate care sites, and others.\n\n3. Objectives\nThe purpose of IPC in outpatient settings during the COVID-19 pandemic is to: 1) minimize disease transmission to patients and health workers (HWs), 2) identify persons with signs and symptoms of suspected COVID-19 for rapid isolation and triage, and 3) maintain essential health services.\n\n4.  Responsible Personnel to Implement IPC in Outpatient Settings\nIPC activities in outpatient settings should be planned, implemented, and overseen by designated staff with experience in IPC.  In many settings, these dedicated staff may consult other stakeholders such as facility leadership, occupational health, nursing, environmental services, engineering, or other relevant staff in the form of an IPC committee.\n\nDesignated IPC staff (or an IPC focal point) at facilities should also consult and coordinate activities with local and national IPC public health authorities based in the Ministry of Health or other relevant institution. In many settings, these district or national-level IPC focal points can help to provide supportive supervision of ongoing activities to assist facility staff in effective implementation.\n\n5.  Key Considerations for Outpatient Facilities\nThere are four operational steps to consider when planning outpatient service continuation in the context of COVID-19:\n\nModify service delivery through IPC administrative and engineering controls to maximize patient and HW safety\nPrepare staff and facilities to receive patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19\nImplement controls to rapidly identify and isolate patients with suspected COVID-19\nImplement IPC for alternate care sites and non-facility-based care\nA. Modify service delivery through IPC administrative and engineering controls to maximize patient and HW safety\n\nModifications to outpatient operations (e.g., IPC administrative controls) and modifications to the physical layout of a facility (e.g., IPC engineering controls) are important ways to reduce crowding and mixing of potentially infectious and non-infectious patients at facilities, preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the process.  Coordination with local public health authorities is helpful to expand strategies available to an individual facility (e.g., identifying alternate care sites for essential health services).  Additionally, in communities with widespread community transmissionexternal icon of COVID-19, implementing source control of all patients, visitors, and HWs at clinics through wearing of non-medical masks can also reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2.  While non-medical masks are recommended for the general population, medical masksexternal icon should be prioritized for HWs or vulnerable populations, including persons aged \u226560 years or persons with underlying co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, or persons with immunosuppression.\n\nStrategies to reduce risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in outpatient facilities for essential and non-essential health services and for modifications for patients who are acutely ill or have respiratory symptoms are described below:\n\nModifications to outpatient operations for essential health services to reduce risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission\n\nDetailed considerations for modifying service delivery of essential health services, including disease-specific considerations, can be found here. Minimum IPC requirements to maintain essential health servicesexternal icon have also been described. Examples of such strategies include:\nConsider dedicating certain days/times for services (e.g., vaccinations on Mondays, obstetric patients on Thursdays, etc.).\nDispense additional doses of medications for patients with stable, chronic disease to reduce number of times a patient needs to visit the pharmacy.\nIdentify separate locations (e.g., schools, churches, etc.) for holding well visits for children.\nConsider non-facility-based settings (e.g., outreach or mobile services) for delivery of services based on the local context and ability to ensure IPC practices and safety of HWs and the community. \nModifications to outpatient operations for non-essential health services during COVID-19\n\nIdentify non-essential health services that can be delayed or canceled in accordance with any local or national guidance. Postponing non-essential health services allows HWs to be available to provide COVID-19 care and reduces crowding in waiting rooms.\nExamples of such services include routine vision or dental check-ups and annual physical exams.\nExplore alternatives to in-person encounters (see section below).\nModifications to outpatient operations for patients who are acutely ill or have symptoms consistent with COVID-19external icon\n\nOutpatient facilities, in conjunction with national authorities, could consider alternatives to in-person triage as well as visits using telemedicine (e.g., telephone consultations or cell phone videoconference) to provide clinical support without direct contact with the patient.\nEstablish a hotline that:\nPatients can call or text notifying the facility that they are seeking care due to respiratory symptoms or other acute illnesses.\nCan be used as telephone consultation for patients to determine if they need to visit a healthcare facility.\nCan inform patients of preventive measures to take as they come to the facility (e.g., wearing mask or having tissues to cover coughs or sneezes).\nProvide information to the general public through local mass media such as radio, television, newspapers, and social media platforms about availability of a hotline, signs and symptoms of COVID-19, and when to seek care.\nIf a patient with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 can be managed by telephone and advised to stay home:\nAssess the patient\u2019s ability to engage in home monitoring, their ability to safely isolate at home, and the risk of them transmitting the virus to others in their home environment.\nProvide clear instructions to caregivers and sick persons regarding home care (WHO home care guidanceexternal icon) and when and how to access the healthcare system for face-to-face care or urgent/emergent conditions.\nIf possible, identify HWs who can monitor those patients at home with daily \u201ccheck-ins\u201d using telephone calls, text, or other means.\nB. Prepare staff and facilities to receive patients with suspected COVID-19\n\nDespite modifications to outpatient operations to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission at facilities, patients with possible COVID-19 will still be seen.  Optimizing preparedness of facilities to receive patients with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 can help limit the risk of COVID-19 exposure to patients and staff.  Facility leadership and the IPC focal point should review WHO IPC guidance during health care when COVID-19 is suspectedexternal icon and follow national IPC guidance to begin preparing facilities to safely triage and manage patients with respiratory illness, including COVID-19.  Consider the following measures:\n\nInfection control infrastructure and healthcare workforce\n\nConsistent with WHO guidelines on infection prevention and control programsexternal icon, national IPC programs should coordinate and facilitate implementation of IPC activities, including COVID-19 prevention activities, across all vertical programs within the Ministry of Health and through multimodal strategies at the sub-national level. Such strategies include ensuring availability of appropriate infrastructure and supplies to support good IPC practices, supporting education and training of the healthcare workforce, and providing data feedback on outcomes.  This role for the national IPC program remains especially relevant during the COVID-19 response.\nDesignate a staff member (IPC focal point) to be responsible for implementation of COVID-19 prevention measures at the facility. The IPC focal point, in collaboration with other relevant persons, should coordinate and implement various activities in the facility:\nFacilitate implementation of engineering controls or structural changes to the facility that reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., designating a separate waiting area for patients with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 or installing physical barriers like glass or plastic screens at screening and triage stations).\nCoordinate and communicate with local public health authorities to understand protocols for reporting suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients and mechanisms to request additional supplies or other support.\nReview sick leave policies for HWs and ensure that they are not punishing but are flexible and consistent with public health guidance to allow ill HWs to stay home.\nDevelop a system to screen HWs for symptoms of COVID-19external icon prior to building entry, which may include self-reporting of symptoms (e.g., cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, myalgias, fatigue, diarrhea), objective checks for fever (temperature >38oC) or a combination of both.\nFor example, employees could be advised to report to their supervisor (or send a text message to their supervisor) before beginning their workday to confirm they have no symptoms that are consistent with COVID-19 (using a standard list of possible symptoms).\nIn collaboration with local public health authorities, a standard text message could also be sent to employees each morning to ask if they have any symptoms consistent with COVID-19.\nAssess supplies for hand hygiene, PPE, and cleaning and disinfection\nAssess availability and accessibility of supplies needed to perform frequent hand hygiene using either an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.\nAssess supplies of PPE needed for HWs to implement contact and droplet precautions for all patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. These supplies include medical masks,[1] eye protection (face shields or goggles), gloves, and gowns.\nMonitor the use of these supplies, which can be inserted into a PPE burn rate calculator to estimate projected need for PPE.\nEven if PPE shortages do not currently exist at the facility, given disruptions in the global supply chain for PPE, plan to optimize your facility\u2019s supply of PPEpdf iconexternal icon. Consider implementing strategies for rational use of PPEpdf iconexternal icon and extended use or reuse of PPE following appropriate decontamination/sterilization procedures.\nAssess supplies needed to clean and disinfect medical equipment (e.g., stethoscopes) and frequently touched surfaces (e.g., chairs and door handles) and to perform terminal cleaning at the facility at least once a day.\nCoordinate and ensure training for relevant staff on the following:\nStandard and transmission-based precautionsexternal icon\nAppropriate use of PPEexternal icon, including:\nwhen to use PPE\nwhat PPE is necessary\nhow to properly put on (don), use, and take off (doff) PPE in a manner to prevent self-contamination\nhow to properly dispose of or disinfect and maintain PPE\nCleaning and disinfectionexternal icon practices, including:\nwhat PPE to wear while performing such cleaning\nhow to appropriately put on (don), use, and take off (doff) all recommended PPE to prevent self-contamination\nType of disinfectant and contact timeexternal icon\nGiven the urgency for training and the need for widespread dissemination of recommended PPE, cleaning and disinfection practices, remote training options could be considered, including use of online courses that have already been developedexternal icon or establishing routine conference calls to provide basic instructions and answer questions directly from facility IPC focal persons.\nAssist with employee health policies including policies and procedures for HWs who develop any symptoms or signs consistent with COVID-19:\nDevelop procedures for managing ill HWs. For example:\nIf a HW becomes symptomatic while at work, he/she should be instructed to notify the supervisor and go home.\nThe focal IPC point at the facility or supervisor should facilitate obtaining a COVID-19 test for the HW, because a positive test can guide how long the HW will need to be excluded from work in accordance with national or sub-national guidelines. In settings with limited testing availability, HWs suspected of having COVID-19 who are not tested should also be excluded from work for a period determined by national or sub-national guidelines.\nPrepare for HW shortages caused by employee illness or illness in employees\u2019 family members that would require them to stay home.\nPlanning for increased absenteeism could include extending hours, cross-training current employees, and hiring temporary employees.\nDevelop a roster of people who can surge in for all categories of staff.\nC. Rapidly identify and separate patients with suspected COVID-19\n\nAs recommended by WHOexternal icon, all patients arriving at outpatient facilities require screening to rapidly identify and separate patients with suspected COVID-19.  The IPC focal point at the facility, under authority from facility leadership, should oversee implementation of screening to prevent spread of SARS-CoV-2 at these facilities.  Screening and triage can be operationalized in the following ways:\n\nPlace visual alerts such as signs and posters at entrances and in strategic places providing instruction (in local languages) on hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, cough etiquette, and maintaining physical distance of at least 2 meters from other patients and staff.\nEstablish a separate registration desk for patients coming in with symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and place signs at the entrance directing patients to the designated registration desk.\nConsider installing physical barriers (e.g., glass or plastic screens) for registration desk/reception area to limit direct contact between registration desk personnel and potentially infectious patients.\nAt registration, every patient should be asked if they have a standard set of symptoms consistent with COVID-19external icon based on local or national guidance. Patients with any one of these symptoms meet criteria for suspected COVID-19 and should be:\nGiven a medical mask (or at least paper tissues to cover their nose and mouth when in the presence of others, if masks are unavailable) for source control;\nSeparated from patients without any of these symptoms in a different waiting area, ideally outdoors, if weather permits; and\nFast-tracked for clinical assessment.\nRegistration/triage desks should be stocked with supplies of medical masks and paper tissues, and access to nearby hand hygiene stations (soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub) should be made available.\nIf screening personnel are unable to maintain physical distance of \u22652 meters from patients, they should wear a medical mask and eye protection (e.g., goggles or face shield) and have easy access hand hygiene stations.\nAfter screening, patients with suspected COVID-19 should be fast-tracked for clinical assessment, which would ideally occur in a single-person room.  During clinical assessment, ensure that windows, if present in the room, are opened as fully as possible to optimize ventilation and close doors that lead to hallways.  Prior to entering the room, perform hand hygiene (using a station that should be located near the outside of the room) and wear all recommended PPE.\n\nD . Implement IPC for alternate care sites and non-facility-based care\n\nTo minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the use of alternate care sites or non-facility-based models of healthcare delivery may be considered to separate healthy patients in need of essential health services from patients seeking care for acute illness.  Alternate care sites include community-based locations, such as schools or churches, that might be temporarily out-of-use due to local mitigation measures.  Such sites offer the benefit of space to allow appropriate physical distancing of staff and patients.  However, since these sites are not primarily intended for the delivery of healthcare, their structure might not be suitable for outpatient services that require physical exams and are best used to deliver single-purpose care, e.g., drug pick-ups, immunizationspdf iconexternal icon, or well-child visits.  Similarly, non-facility-based care, which includes outreach services to people\u2019s homes or mobile services, help minimize crowding at healthcare facilities while maintaining essential health services.\n\nIPC is always needed wherever healthcare is delivered, including in alternate care sites and non-facility-based care.  At a minimum, HWs delivering care in these settings require education and training in good IPC practices, including standard and transmission-based precautions.  Patients and staff should maintain physical separation of at least 2 meters from others at all times.  Additional IPC considerations for specific situations are below:\n\nAlternate care sites\nEstablish a system of screening and triage for patients arriving at alternate care sites as described in section C\nOutreach to patients\u2019 homes\nPractice frequent hand hygiene before and after each patient encounter using portable alcohol-based hand rub.\nGiven that HWs might encounter persons or families with respiratory symptoms, consider extended use of medical masks and eye protection (e.g., face shields or goggles) for each shift.\nFor healthcare services that require gloves or gowns, special considerations are needed for appropriate donning, doffing, and disposal of this PPE due to variable availability of space to don/doff PPE and limited access to waste receptacles for disposal of PPE.\nMobile medical units\nEnsure that the vehicle is well-ventilated by opening all windows.\nStock vehicle with adequate supplies of alcohol-based hand rub for frequent hand hygiene and all recommended PPE.\nBring visual alerts or signs to encourage patients to take appropriate IPC precautions while waiting in queues, including maintaining physical distance of at least 2 meters from others and practicing hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette.",

            "Text": "Emergency Committee for Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (provinces of Ituri, North Kivu, and South Kivu) on 26 June 2020\nThe 8th meeting of the Emergency Committee, convened by the WHO Director-General under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) to review the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Ituri, North Kivu, and South Kivu provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), took place on Friday, 26 June 2020, from 13:00 to 15:50 Geneva time (CEST). The Committee\u2019s role is to give advice to the Director-General, who makes the final decision on the determination of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and issues Temporary Recommendations as appropriate.\n\nProceedings of the meeting\nMembers and advisors of the Emergency Committee were convened by teleconference.\n\nThe Secretariat welcomed the Committee and thanked them for their support. The Director-General welcomed the Committee and expressed gratitude for all who have responded to this outbreak.\n\nRepresentatives of WHO\u2019s legal department and the department of compliance, risk management, and ethics briefed the Committee members on their roles and responsibilities. Committee members were reminded of their duty of confidentiality and their responsibility to disclose personal, financial, or professional connections that might be seen to constitute a conflict of interest. Each member who was present was surveyed and no conflicts of interest were judged to be relevant to the meeting.\n\nThe meeting was turned over to the Chair, Dr Preben Aavitsland. Dr Aavitsland also welcomed the Committee, outlined the objectives of the meeting, and introduced the presenters.\n\nPresentations were made by a representative of the Ministry of Health of the DRC and the WHO Secretariat to update the Committee on the situation.\n\nThe DRC Ministry of Health provided an update of the epidemiological situation. As of 23 June 2020, a total of 3 470 EVD cases were reported from 29 health zones, including 3 317 confirmed and 153 probable cases, of which 2 287 cases died (CFR 66%). Since the last reported case on 27 April 2020, no new confirmed or probable cases of EVD have been reported. On 25 June 2020, the DRC Ministry of Health declared that human-to-human transmission of Ebola virus had ended in Ituri, North Kivu, and South Kivu provinces. The Ministry of Health of DRC notes that a separate EVD outbreak is occurring in the Equateur Province, not epidemiologically related to the outbreak in the Ituri, North Kivu, and South Kivu provinces.\n\nThe DRC Ministry of Health is implementing their national response plan to strengthen surveillance, laboratory diagnostic capacities, infection prevention and control (IPC), risk communication and community engagement (RCCE), the EVD survivor care programme, and provincial health departments\u2019 operational capacities.\n\nThe WHO Secretariat presented the WHO risk assessment and context. Based on the evolution of the outbreak, current epidemiology, and response in Ituri, North Kivu, and South Kivu provinces, the overall national and regional risk levels remain moderate. The global risk level remains low.\n\nWHO noted that regional preparedness capacities built for EVD response, such as coordination mechanisms; response plans; laboratory diagnostic capacity; rapid response teams; and community-based surveillance systems, are also being used to facilitate a robust COVID-19 response.\n\nRemaining challenges include the need for continued human and financial resources to maintain prevention, preparedness, response and control activities, such as the EVD survivor care programme; the volatile security situation; the new EVD outbreak in Equateur Province; and the concurrent burden of COVID-19, cholera, and measles.\n\nAlthough the outbreak in Ituri, North Kivu, and South Kivu provinces has been officially declared over, the detection of a new EVD outbreak in Equateur Province highlights the potential for re-introduction from animal reservoirs. The DRC and at-risk countries need to maintain vigilance to mitigate the risk of EVD re-emergence as well as to rapidly detect and respond to any new cluster.\n\nContext and Discussion\nThe Committee congratulated the Ministry of Health on the conclusion of the EVD outbreak in Ituri, North Kivu, and South Kivu provinces. The Committee conveyed their strong appreciation to the World Health Organization for their support in ending this challenging outbreak. The Committee also thanked the health workers, donors, and all partners who have supported the successful response and recognized the international collaboration and strong solidarity among DRC, neighbouring countries, WHO, and partners.\n\nThe Committee noted that the genetic sequencing has confirmed that the EVD outbreaks in the Ituri, North Kivu, and South Kivu provinces and the Equateur province are epidemiologically distinct events.\n\nThe Committee highlighted the importance of the 90-day national response plan which includes maintaining intensive surveillance, response capacity, and follow-up with EVD survivors. DRC and partners are engaging in all measures to reduce the potential for a resurgence in Ituri, North Kivu, and South Kivu provinces. The Committee noted the importance of the EVD survivor care programme and continued RCCE activities, which will continue to be conducted by locally trained staff in each province with support from national staff as needed.\n\nThe Committee expressed concern over the lack of prioritized resources to operationalize the 90-day national response plan and maintain long-term local capacity for prevention and response. Financial and human resources of DRC, WHO, and partners are challenged by the concurrent COVID-19, cholera, and measles outbreaks. The Committee encouraged DRC, WHO, and partners to harmonize EVD, cholera, measles, and COVID-19 prevention and control activities.\n\nConclusions and Advice\nThe Committee agreed that the current situation in the Ituri, North Kivu, and South Kivu provinces no longer constitutes a public health emergency of international concern.\n\nThe Committee emphasized the importance of continued donors\u2019 funding and human resources to operationalize the 90-day day national response plan.\n\nThe Committee provided the following advice to the Director-General for his issuance as revised Temporary Recommendations, in accordance with Article 15(1) of the IHR (2005) \u201c\u2026Temporary Recommendations may be modified or extended as appropriate, including after it has been determined that a public health emergency of international concern has ended, at which time other temporary recommendations may be issued as necessary for the purpose of preventing or promptly detecting its recurrence [\u2026] These Temporary Recommendations shall automatically expire three months after their issuance.\u201d\n\nThe Committee provided the following advice to the Director-General for his issuance as revised Temporary Recommendations under the IHR (2005).\n\nFor DRC:\nOperationalize their 90-day national response plan and ensure the appropriate human and financial resources are available for implementation throughout the full duration.\nContinue their EVD survivor care programme which provides clinical, biological, and social support to survivors.\nContinue the use of the Community Action Cells, or comparable community-level resources, for locally based RCCE to address potential EVD flare-ups and spillover events. Leverage resources, as needed by integrating EVD RCCE activities with concurrent response efforts related to outbreaks of measles, cholera, and COVID-19.\nTake note of the upcoming Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) recommendations on the use of EVD vaccines.\nDevelop an EVD prevention and control plan to sustain preparedness and response capacity beyond the initial 90-day national response plan.",

            "Text": "Today marks the end of the 10th outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This long, complex and difficult outbreak has been overcome due to the leadership and commitment of the Government of the DRC, supported by the World Health Organization (WHO), a multitude of partners, donors, and above all, the efforts of the communities affected by the virus. \n\nWHO congratulates all those involved in the arduous and often dangerous work required to end the outbreak, but stresses the need for vigilance. Continuing to support survivors and maintaining strong surveillance and response systems in order to contain potential flare-ups is critical in the months to come.\n\n\"The outbreak took so much from all of us, especially from the people of DRC, but we came out of it with valuable lessons, and valuable tools. The world is now better-equipped to respond to Ebola. A vaccine has been licensed, and effective treatments identified,\u201d said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n\n\u201cWe should celebrate this moment, but we must resist complacency. Viruses do not take breaks. Ultimately, the best defence against any outbreak is investing in a stronger health system as the foundation for universal health coverage.\u201d\n\nThe outbreak, declared in North Kivu on 1 August 2018, was the second largest in the world, and was particularly challenging as it took place an active conflict zone. There were 3470 cases, 2287 deaths and 1171 survivors. \n\nLed by the DRC Government and the Ministry of Health and supported by WHO and partners, the more than 22-month-long response involved training thousands of health workers, registering 250 000 contacts, testing 220 000 samples, providing patients with equitable access to advanced therapeutics, vaccinating over 303 000 people with the highly effective rVSV-ZEBOV-GP vaccine, and offering care for all survivors after their recovery.\n\nThe response was bolstered by the engagement and leadership of the affected communities. Thanks to their efforts, this outbreak did not spread globally. More than 16 000 local frontline responders worked alongside the more than 1500 people deployed by WHO. Support from donors was essential, as was the work of UN partner agencies, national and international NGOs, research networks, and partners deployed through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. Hard work to build up preparedness capacities in neighbouring countries also limited the risk of the outbreak expanding.\n\nWork will continue to build on the gains made in this response to address other health challenges, including measles and COVID-19.\n\n\u201cDuring the almost two years we fought the Ebola virus, WHO and partners helped strengthen the capacity of local health authorities to manage outbreaks,\u201d said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.\n\n\u201cThe DRC is now better, smarter and faster at responding to Ebola and this is an enduring legacy which is supporting the response to COVID-19 and other outbreaks.\u201d \n\nAs countries around the world face the COVID-19 pandemic, the DRC Ebola response provides valuable lessons. Many of the public health measures that have been successful in stopping Ebola are the same measures that are now essential for stopping COVID-19: finding, isolating, testing, and caring for every case and relentless contact tracing. \n\nIn DRC, community workers were provided with training and a smartphone data collection app that enabled them to track contacts and report in real time rather than fill in laborious paper reports. Even when violence locked down cities, the community workers, many of them local women, continued to track and trace contacts using the application, something that was crucial for ending this outbreak.\n\nWhile this 10th outbreak in DRC has ended, the fight against Ebola continues. On 1 June 2020, seven cases of Ebola were reported in Mbandaka city and neighbouring Bikoro Health Zone in Equateur Province and an 11th outbreak was declared. WHO is supporting the government-led response with more than 50 staff already deployed and more than 5000 vaccinations already administered.\n\nWHO salutes the thousands of heroic responders who fought one of the world\u2019s most dangerous viruses in one of the world\u2019s most unstable regions. Some health workers, including WHO experts, paid the ultimate price and sacrificed their lives to the Ebola response.",

            "Text": "12 November 2009 - Nearly all the countries of the world have now reported cases of infection with pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. A substantial number of deaths have occurred in patients with chronic respiratory conditions, raising concern about the possible impact of influenza on patients with active tuberculosis. The information note below, prepared by WHO Stop TB Department, is aimed at informing health care managers and decision makers on areas of overlap between the two conditions.\n\nInformation note\nPANDEMIC INFLUENZA A (H1N1) 2009: CONSIDERATIONS FOR TUBERCULOSIS CARE SERVICES\nCoordinated by Paul Nunn (Coordinator) and Dennis Falzon (Medical Officer), Stop TB Department, WHO, Geneva\n\nMore than 482,000 cases of infection with pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus have now been confirmed from all over the world and more than 6000 deaths have been reported to WHO.i ii A substantial number of deaths have occurred in patients with chronic respiratory conditions, raising concern about the possible impact of influenza on patients with active tuberculosis. This note is intended to sensitize tuberculosis programme managers to possible challenges and synergies in the efforts to control the two conditions.\n\n1) Coordinate with country preparedness plans\nA health emergency, such as an influenza pandemic, may necessitate the mobilization of resources from the rest of the health services. Tuberculosis programmes may be required to provide their share. However, a breakdown in tuberculosis service delivery should be averted, as it can have disastrous consequences for many years afterwards. On the other hand, tuberculosis programmes have extensive experience in delivering treatment in decentralized settings, including patient homes. These setups may be useful in the provision of influenza services during severe epidemics.\n\n2) Health-care services should prepare for the added challenge of influenza\nRespiratory physicians and tuberculosis specialists may be points of reference for patients with pulmonary complications of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza. They should familiarize themselves with WHO recommendations for the use of anti-influenza medication.iii Effective medication may reduce morbidity and mortality from both influenza and most forms of tuberculosis. Health-care services, however, must be well prepared to provide for the two diseases.\n\n3) Tuberculosis care should be ensured, even if influenza overwhelms health-care services\nAnti-tuberculosis medications must continue during an influenza pandemic. The supply of drugs must not be interrupted. Special care should be given to vulnerable patients, among whom poorer outcomes are likely. Influenza in patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis, for example, may be more severe than in uncomplicated tuberculosis.iv Patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are generally more likely to die or suffer from advanced lung disease, so their prognosis after influenza also may be poorer.\n\n4) Measures to prevent complications and transmission should be put in place\nVaccines. Regulatory authorities have now licensed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccines in a number of countriesv WHO experts recommend that health-care workers should be prioritized for vaccination. Given that susceptibility to the new virus is expected to be widespread, persons with underlying medical conditions (including tuberculosis), as well as healthy children and adults, should be considered for vaccination subject to vaccine availability and to country-defined priorities. For patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis, the standard recommendations for seasonal influenza immunization apply depending on vaccine availability.\n\nAntivirals. WHO does not recommend prophylaxis with antiviral medications.\n\nInfection control. Sanatoria, tuberculosis hospitals and clinics, as well as general hospitals and outpatient departments, are all sites of possible transmission of influenza to tuberculosis patients. Measures must be put in place to limit transmission in these facilities. WHO recommendations for preventing infection from tuberculosisvi and of confirmed or suspected infection with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virusvii should be implemented. Although the modes of transmission of the two diseases are slightly different, source control measures (e.g. cough etiquette, separation of coughers) and prevention of crowding are important to reduce transmission of both tuberculosis and influenza.\n\n5) Use tuberculosis resources developed by WHO to increase laboratory support to influenza\nWHO has built a large network of international technical and funding agencies to improve access to new tuberculosis diagnostics within appropriate laboratory services. By virtue of a number of components, these laboratories can also be useful for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 diagnostics and surveillance, including specimen transport mechanisms, molecular detection of drug resistance, training on good laboratory practice, microbiological technique, and biosafety. The laboratories are supported by an excellent supranational network of reference laboratories located throughout the world.",

            "Text": "The influenza A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic revealed that WHO and Member States were not fully prepared to rapidly assess the severity (transmission, seriousness of disease and impact) of a pandemic, or to implement risk communications and risk management plans.   \n\nMember States had prepared for a pandemic of high severity, and faced difficulties in adapting their national and subnational responses adequately to a more moderate event. Communication was also demonstrated to be of immense importance: the need to provide clear risk assessments to decision-makers placed significant strain on ministries of health; and effective communication with the public was challenging.  \n\nIn response to lessons learnt from the H1N1 2009 pandemic, a revised approach to global phases of pandemic influenza was developed. The phases, which are based on virological, epidemiological and clinical data, are to be used for describing the spread of a new influenza subtype, taking account of the disease it causes around the world. The global phases have been clearly uncoupled from risk management decisions and actions at the country level. Thus, Member States are encouraged as far as possible to use national risk assessments to inform management decisions for the benefit of their country\u2019s specific situation and needs. \n\nOne of the most critical steps in the response to a pandemic is the time when it is declared. The International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR (2005)) guide whether an outbreak is determined to be a pandemic. First, a disease outbreak must be designated a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), meaning it is serious, unusual, and has a significant chance of international spread and may require a coordinated international response. Once the risk assessment and spread are determined to have crossed into two different WHO global regions, the WHO Director-General may make a declaration of a pandemic (based on advice received from a committee of experts from a broad span of disciplines).  \n\nThe 2009 H1N1 pandemic was the first test of the IHR (2005) since they were revised in the wake of the 2003 SARS epidemic and the H5N1 influenza epidemic - both deadly outbreaks that alerted the world that when it comes to infectious disease, international cooperation is essential. The IHR (2005) requires States Parties to strengthen core public health capacities to detect, assess, respond to and report events that may be public health emergencies of international concern, while at the same time avoiding unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade.  \n\nCountry insights: Bangladesh \nPandemics by their nature are unpredictable, not only as to timing, but also where they will first emerge. For Bangladesh, 2009 was a lesson learned, said Prof Mahmudur Rahman, Former Director of the National Influenza Centre, Bangladesh. \u201cWe were concentrating more on the rural population because it was understood that this pandemic will start from the villages, from the rural community and from the farms where the poultry is reared.\u201d  \n\nBut as it turned out the virus first emerged in Mexico and then made its way to the United States \u2013 and it was from the USA that it came to Bangladesh, said Prof Rahman. A group of 29 Bangladeshi students had been studying in the USA, and when they returned, six were infected. \u201cSo, it came from the airport, from the plane, and that was detected by our event-based surveillance.\u201d  \n\nAs the virus spread, Bangladesh public health authorities traced contacts of those affected, going house to house, putting patients in isolation. The international assistance Bangladesh received in developing its influenza detection and response platform, and guidance from WHO, played a significant role in the country\u2019s response, he said.  \n\nCountry insights: Mexico \nFor Mexico, a lesson learned from 2009 is that constant surveillance is critical.  \u201cWe share information on a weekly basis of an average of twenty thousand health facilities in the country, including in the private sector. That gives us an idea of what's going on in the different areas of the country, in order to focus our activities in those areas that we consider to be of more risk,\u201d said Dr Cuauhtemoc Mancha-Moctezuma, the deputy director general for the National Center of Preventive Programs and Disease Control, Mexico. Focusing on diseases transmitted from animals to humans \u2013 zoonoses \u2013 is critical, he said. \u201cWe have a very strong collaboration with ministries related to animals, production and agriculture.\u201d  \n\nCountry insights: Viet Nam  \nFollowing the 2009 pandemic, WHO supported the country to strengthen its laboratory system, including specimen collection and transportation and implementation of modern diagnostic techniques, and notably, advanced virus characterization at its National Influenza Centres. The country has also trained over 300 health workers from provincial hospitals throughout the country in clinical management of acute respiratory infections. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s next? We need to strengthen the capacity for district hospitals in responding to pandemic influenza, as they are the first line of defense,\" said Dr Nguyen Van Kinh, the Deputy Director of the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Viet Nam. He also noted the need to improve infection prevention and control procedures to stop outbreaks from spreading in hospitals and clinics.",

Several areas continue to have evidence of active but declining transmission, particularly in North Africa and in limited areas of Eastern Europe and East Asia.\n\nIn North Africa, pandemic influenza transmission remains active and geographically widespread but overall activity has been declining since peaking during late December 2009 and early January 2010. During January 2010, a substantial decline in the number of pandemic virus isolations and new cases was observed in Morocco and Egypt, respectively. In West Asia, pandemic influenza transmission remains geographically widespread to regional, but overall activity remained low.\n\nIn South and Southeast Asia, pandemic influenza transmission remains active but geographically localized to regional. The overall intensity of respiratory diseases activity was reported to be low to moderate in most places. In India, influenza activity continued to decline in all regions of the country, however, the most active areas of transmission currently are in the western states. An overall peak in the number of pandemic H1N1 cases was recorded in India during mid December 2009, and the majority of these cases were identified in the northern and western states of India. In Thailand, overall ILI activity remained low, however focal increase in activity were observed in several central and northern provinces.\n\nIn East Asia, pandemic influenza transmission remains active and geographically widespread across the region, however, overall activity continued to decline. In Japan, overall influenza activity continues to decline but transmission remains higher on the southern island of Okinawa than in other places. In the Republic of Korea (South Korea), rates of ILI continued to decline to near baseline after a substantial wave of activity which peaked during early to mid November 2009. In Mongolia, after a period of sustained elevated ILI activity since early November 2009, levels of ILI have recently fallen to the expected seasonal range. In northern and southern China, rates of ILI have returned to levels seen during recent seasons; however, approximately 30% of respiratory specimens tested were positive for influenza suggesting that active transmission of influenza viruses persists. Of note in China, in recent weeks the circulation of pandemic influenza H1N1 continued to decline with a concomitant increase in the circulation of seasonal influenza type B viruses (pandemic H1N1 and seasonal Type B viruses accounted for 34% and 66% of all influenza viruses detected, respectively). Active transmission of pandemic influenza virus also persists in Hong Kong SAR (China), although at significantly lower levels than an earlier peak of activity during September and October 2009.\n\nIn Europe, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active in a limited number of countries as overall activity remained low in most places. At least seven countries testing more than 20 sentinel respiratory samples reported that >20% of samples had tested positive for influenza (Albania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Georgia, Greece, Luxembourg, and Romania); however, in all seven, rates of illness remained well below earlier peaks of activity. Small increases in ILI/ARI have been reported over the past two reporting weeks in Slovakia, Belarus, and the Russian Federation. The overall rate of sentinel respiratory samples testing positive for influenza fell to 14% after reaching a peak of 45% during early November 2009.\n\nIn the Americas, both in the tropical and northern temperate zones, overall pandemic influenza activity continued to decline or remain low in most places. In Central America and Caribbean, pandemic influenza virus transmission persists but overall activity remains low or unchanged in most places.\n\nIn temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases of pandemic influenza continued to be reported without evidence of sustained community transmission.\n\nPandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 virus continues to be the predominant influenza virus circulating worldwide. In addition to the increasing proportion of seasonal influenza type B viruses recently detected in China, low levels of seasonal H3N2 and type B viruses are circulating in parts of Africa, East and Southeast Asia and are being detected only sporadically on other continents.\n\nThe Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

Tests were performed in two laboratories in Kyiv, including the National Influenza Centre. Confirmatory tests will be performed at one of the WHO Collaborating Centres for Influenza.\n\nThe situation is quickly changing with increasingly high levels of acute respiratory illness (ARI)/Influenza-like-illness (ILI) activity being observed in Ternopil, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Chernivtsi regions. The higher levels of transmission in these regions corresponds to an increased number of hospital admissions and fatalities associated with severe manifestations of acute respiratory illness.\n\nAs of 30 October 2009, over 2,300 individuals have been admitted to hospital, including over 1,100 children. One hundred and thirty one (131) cases have required intensive care, including 32 children. As of 31 October 2009, a total of 38 fatalities associated with severe manifestations of ARI have been registered. Preliminary epidemiological data analysis indicates that severe cases and deaths primarily occur among previously healthy young adults aged 20 \u2013 50 years. Fatal and severe cases are reported to have sought medical attention 5 to 7 days after onset of symptoms.\n\nInternational experience of the (H1N1) 2009 pandemic to date, especially from the Southern Hemisphere, has shown that poor clinical outcomes are associated with delays in seeking health care and limited access to supportive care. In addition, this virus has also shown its ability to cause rapidly progressive overwhelming lung disease which is very difficult to treat.\n\nPublic health measures recommended by the Ministry of Health of Ukraine across the entire country include: social distancing (school closures and cancellation of mass gatherings); enhancement of surveillance activities; increased respiratory hygiene; and continuation of the vaccination campaign against seasonal influenza targeting at risk groups.\n\nThe Government of the Ukraine has activated coordination mechanisms to respond to the rapidly evolving situation, including the harmonization of response plans across all administrative levels.\n\nIn response to the request from the Minister of Health of Ukraine, WHO is deploying a multi-disciplinary team of experts to assist national authorities in mitigating the impact of the pandemic. The team comprises of the following expertise: health emergencies coordination, case management, epidemiology, laboratory diagnostics, logistics, and media/risk communications.\n\nAs per WHO's communication in May 2009, there is no rationale for travel restrictions because such measures will not prevent the spread of the disease.\n\nTravellers can protect themselves and others by following simple recommendations aimed at preventing the spread of infection such as attention to respiratory hygiene. Individuals who are ill should delay travel plans and returning travellers who fall ill should seek appropriate medical care. These recommendations are prudent measures which can limit the spread of many communicable diseases and not only the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus.",

Levels of ILI have continued to increase and remain above the seasonal baseline for the past 4 weeks in most regions of the United States. In Mexico, a high intensity of respiratory diseases has been reported for two consecutive weeks (week 37 - 38), with large increases in cases being reported in the north and northwest of the country. In Europe and Central and Western Asia, although overall influenza activity remains low an increase in transmission has been noted in a number of countries and continues to intensify in others. Rates of influenza-like-illness continue to be above baseline levels in Ireland, parts of the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland), Israel, and France; in addition, more than 10 other countries in the region have reported geographically localized spread of influenza. In Japan, influenza activity has continued to increase above the seasonal epidemic threshold since week 33. These increases in ILI activity have been accompanied by increases in laboratory isolations of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009 in most of these areas.\n\nIn the tropical regions of the Americas and Asia, influenza transmission remains active but the trends in respiratory diseases activity are mixed. Although respiratory disease activity is geographically regional to widespread throughout the tropical region of the Americas, many countries have been recently reporting a declining trend (Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Panama, Paraguay, Venezuela), while others recently reported an increasing trend (Columbia and Cuba). In tropical regions of Asia, there continues to be an increasing trend in respiratory diseases in parts of India and in Cambodia, while other countries in the Southeast Asia have been recently reporting declining transmission.\n\nIn the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, influenza transmission has largely returned to baseline (Chile, Argentina, and New Zealand) or has declined substantially (Australia and South Africa).\n\nAll pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza viruses analyzed to date have been antigenically and genetically similar to A/California/7/2009-like pandemic H1N1 2009 virus. See below for a detailed laboratory surveillance update.\n\nWeekly update (Virological surveillance data)\n\nSystematic surveillance conducted by the Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN), supported by WHO Collaborating Centres and other laboratories, continues to detect sporadic incidents of H1N1 pandemic viruses that show resistance to the antiviral oseltamivir. To date, 28 resistant pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses have been detected and characterized worldwide. All of these viruses show the same H275Y mutation that confers resistance to the antiviral oseltamivir, but not to the antiviral zanamivir. No new resistant pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses have been officially reported to WHO during the past week. Worldwide, more than 10,000 clinical specimens (samples and isolates) of the pandemic H1N1 virus have been tested and found to be sensitive to oseltamivir.\n\n*Countries in temperate regions are defined as those north of the Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn, while countries in tropical regions are defined as those between these two latitudes.\nQualitative indicators (Week 29 to Week 38: 13 July - 20 September 2009)\nThe qualitative indicators monitor: the global geographic spread of influenza, trends in acute respiratory diseases, the intensity of respiratory disease activity, and the impact of the pandemic on health-care services.\n\nHuman infection with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus: updated interim WHO guidance on global surveillance\nA description of WHO pandemic monitoring and surveillance objectives and methods can be found in the updated interim WHO guidance for the surveillance of human infection with pandemic (H1N1) virus.\nThe maps below display information on the qualitative indicators reported during weeks 29 to 38. Information is available for approximately 60 countries each week. Implementation of this monitoring system is ongoing and completeness of reporting is expected to increase over time.",

            "Text": "Why was the use of hydroxychloroquine stopped in the Solidarity Trial?\nOn 17 June 2020, WHO announced that the hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) arm of the Solidarity Trial to find an effective COVID-19 treatment was being stopped. \n\nThe trial's Executive Group and principal investigators made the decision based on evidence from the Solidarity trial, UK's Recovery trial and a Cochrane review of other evidence on hydroxychloroquine.\n\nData from Solidarity (including the French Discovery trial data) and the recently announced results from the UK's Recovery trial both showed that hydroxychloroquine does not result in the reduction of mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 patients, when compared with standard of care.\n\nWhat will happen to the people who were already enrolled in the hydroxychloroquine arm of the trial?\nInvestigators will not randomize further patients to hydroxychloroquine in the Solidarity trial. Patients who have already started hydroxychloroquine but who have not yet finished their course in the trial may complete their course or stop at the discretion of the supervising physician. \n\nThe use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are accepted as generally safe for use in patients with autoimmune diseases or malaria.\n\nWhat is WHO\u2019s view of the use of hydroxychloroquine in pre or post-exposure prophylaxis?\nThe decision to stop hydroxychloroquine\u2019s use in the Solidarity trial does not apply to the use or evaluation of hydroxychloroquine in pre or post-exposure prophylaxis in patients exposed to COVID-19.\n\nWhat is the Solidarity Trial?\n\n\nThe Solidarity Trial is an international clinical trial to help find an effective treatment for COVID-19, launched by WHO and partners. It is hoped that one or more of the treatments under trial will result in improving clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients and save lives. Other trials are on-going around the world in addition to the Solidarity Trial. \n\nThe treatment options are: Remdesivir; Lopinavir/Ritonavir; and Lopinavir/Ritonavir with Interferon beta-1a. The treatment options were originally selected based on evidence from laboratory, animal and clinical studies. Hydroxychloroquine was originally included in the trial but this arm was stopped, as of 17 June 2020, as evidence showed it did not result in the reduction of mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 patients, when compared with standard of care.\n\nOver 100 countries have expressed an interest in participating in the trial and WHO is actively supporting more than 60 of them, including with the following:\n\nethical and regulatory approvals of the WHO core protocol;\nidentification of hospitals participating in the trial;\ntraining of hospital clinicians on the web-based randomization and data system;\nshipping the trial drugs as requested by each participating country.\nAs of 3 June 2020, more than 3500 patients have been recruited in 35 countries, with over 400 hospitals actively recruiting patients. \n\nInterim trial analyses are monitored by a Global Data and Safety Monitoring Committee, which is an independent group of experts.",

GOARN partners include major public health agencies, laboratories, sister UN agencies, international organizations and NGOs.\n\n3 January 2020\nChinese officials provided information to WHO on the cluster of cases of \u2018viral pneumonia of unknown cause\u2019 identified in Wuhan. \n\n4  January 2020\nWHO tweeted that there was a cluster of pneumonia cases \u2013 with no deaths \u2013 in Wuhan, Hubei province, People\u2019s Republic of China, and that investigations to identify the cause were underway.  \n\n5 January 2020\nWHO shared detailed information about a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause through the IHR (2005) Event Information System, which is accessible to all Member States. The event notice provided information on the cases and advised Member States to take precautions to reduce the risk of acute respiratory infections.  \n\nWHO also issued its first Disease Outbreak News report. This is a public, web-based platform for the publication of technical information addressed to the scientific and public health communities, as well as global media. The report contained information about the number of cases and their clinical status; details about the Wuhan national authority\u2019s response measures; and WHO\u2019s risk assessment and advice on public health measures. It advised that \u201cWHO\u2019s recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza and severe acute respiratory infections still apply\u201d.\n\n9 January 2020\nWHO reported that Chinese authorities have determined that the outbreak is caused by a novel coronavirus.\n\nWHO convened the first of many teleconferences with global expert networks, beginning with the Clinical Network.\n\n10 January 2020\nThe Global Coordination Mechanism for Research and Development to prevent and respond to epidemics held its first teleconference on the novel coronavirus, as did the Scientific Advisory Group of the research and development (R&D) Blueprint, a global strategy and preparedness plan that allows the rapid activation of research and development activities during epidemics.\n\nThe Director-General spoke with the Head of the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China. He also had a call to share information with the Director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe Strategic and Technical Advisory Group on Infectious Hazards (STAG-IH) held its first meeting on the novel coronavirus outbreak.\n10-12 January 2020\nWHO published a comprehensive package of guidance documents for countries, covering topics related to the management of an outbreak of a new disease:\n\nInfection prevention and control\nLaboratory testing\nNational capacities review tool\nRisk communication and community engagement\nDisease Commodity Package (v1)\nDisease Commodity Package (v2)\nTravel advice\nClinical management\nSurveillance case definitions\n11 January 2020\nWHO tweeted that it had received the genetic sequences for the novel coronavirus from the People\u2019s Republic of China and expected these to soon be made publicly available. \nChinese media reported the first death from the novel coronavirus. \n\n12 January 2020\nWHO convened the first teleconference with the diagnostics and laboratories global expert network.\n\n13 January 2020\nThe Ministry of Public Health in Thailand reported an imported case of lab-confirmed novel coronavirus from Wuhan, the first recorded case outside of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nWHO publishes first protocol for a RT-PCR assay by a WHO partner laboratory to diagnose the novel coronavirus.\n\n14 January 2020 \n\nWHO held a press briefing during which it stated that, based on experience with respiratory pathogens, the potential for human-to-human transmission in the 41 confirmed cases in the People\u2019s Republic of China existed: \u201cit is certainly possible that there is limited human-to-human transmission\u201d.\n\nWHO tweeted that preliminary investigations by the Chinese authorities had found \u201cno clear evidence of human-to-human transmission\u201d. In its risk assessment, WHO said additional investigation was \u201cneeded to ascertain the presence of human-to-human transmission, modes of transmission, common source of exposure and the presence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases that are undetected\u201d. \n\n16 January 2020\nThe Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare informed WHO of a confirmed case of a novel coronavirus in a person who travelled to Wuhan. This was the second confirmed case detected outside of the People\u2019s Republic of China. WHO stated that considering global travel patterns, additional cases in other countries were likely.\n\nThe Pan American Health Organization/WHO Regional office for the Americas (PAHO/AMRO) issued its first epidemiological alert on the novel coronavirus. The alert included recommendations covering international travellers, infection prevention and control measures and laboratory testing.  \n\n17 January 2020\nWHO convened the first meeting of the analysis and modelling working group for the novel coronavirus.  \n\n19 January 2020\nThe WHO Western Pacific Regional Office (WHO/WPRO) tweeted that, according to the latest information received and WHO analysis, there was evidence of limited human-to-human transmission. \n\n20 January 2020\nWHO published guidance on home care for patients with suspected infection.\n\n20-21 January 2020\nWHO conducted the first mission to Wuhan and met with public health officials to learn about the response to the cluster of cases of novel coronavirus.  \n\n21 January 2020 \nWHO/WPRO tweeted that it was now very clear from the latest information that there was \u201cat least some human-to-human transmission\u201d, and that infections among health care workers strengthened the evidence for this. \n\nThe United States of America (USA) reported its first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus. This was the first case in the WHO Region of the Americas.\n\nWHO convened the first meeting of the global expert network on infection prevention and control. \n\n22 January 2020\nThe WHO mission to Wuhan issued a statement saying that evidence suggested human-to-human transmission in Wuhan but that more investigation was needed to understand the full extent of transmission.\n\n22-23 January 2020\nThe WHO Director-General convened an IHR Emergency Committee (EC) regarding the outbreak of novel coronavirus. The EC was comprised of 15 independent experts from around the world and was charged with advising the Director-General as to whether the outbreak constituted a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).\n\nThe Committee was not able to reach a conclusion on 22 January based on the limited information available. As the Committee was not able to make a recommendation, the Director-General asked the Committee to continue its deliberations the next day. The Director-General held a media briefing on the novel coronavirus, to provide an update on the Committee\u2019s deliberations.\n\nThe EC met again on 23 January and members were equally divided as to whether the event constituted a PHEIC, as several members considered that there was still not enough information for it, given its restrictive and binary nature (only PHEIC or no PHEIC can be determined; there is no intermediate level of warning). As there was a divergence of views, the EC did not advise the Director-General that the event constituted a PHEIC but said it was ready to be reconvened within 10 days. The EC formulated advice for WHO, the People\u2019s Republic of China, other countries and the global community.\n\nThe Director-General accepted the advice of the Committee and held a second media briefing, giving a statement on the advice of the EC and what WHO was doing in response to the outbreak.\n\n24 January 2020\nFrance informed WHO of three cases of novel coronavirus, all of whom had travelled from Wuhan. These were the first confirmed cases in the WHO European region (EURO).\n\nWHO held an informal consultation on the prioritization of candidate therapeutic agents for use in novel coronavirus infection.\n\nThe Director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) urged countries in the Americas to be prepared to detect early, isolate and care for patients infected with the new coronavirus, in case of receiving travelers from countries where there was ongoing transmission of novel coronavirus cases. The Director spoke at a PAHO briefing for ambassadors of the Americas to the Organization of American States (OAS) in Washington.\n\n25 January 2020\nThe WHO Regional Director for Europe issued a public statement outlining the importance of being ready at the local and national levels for detecting cases, testing samples and clinical management.\n\n26 January 2020\nWHO released its first free online course on the novel coronavirus on its OpenWHO learning platform.\n\n27 January 2020\nThe WHO Regional Director for South-East Asia issued a press release that urged countries in the Region to focus on their readiness for the rapid detection of imported cases and prevention of further spread.\n\n27-28 January 2020\nA senior WHO delegation led by the Director-General arrived in Beijing to meet Chinese leaders, learn more about the response in the People\u2019s Republic of China, and to offer technical assistance. The Director-General met with President Xi Jinping on 28 January, and discussed continued collaboration on containment measures in Wuhan, public health measures in other cities and provinces, conducting further studies on the severity and transmissibility of the virus, continuing to share data, and a request for China to share biological material with WHO. They agreed that an international team of leading scientists should travel to China to better understand the context, the overall response, and exchange information and experience.\n\n29 January 2020\nOn his return to Switzerland from China, the Director-General presented an update to Member States on the response to the outbreak of novel coronavirus infection in China, at the 30th Meeting of the Programme, Budget and Administration Committee (PBAC) of the Executive Board. He informed the PBAC that he had reconvened the Emergency Committee on the novel coronavirus under the IHR (2005), which would meet the following day to advise on whether the outbreak constituted a PHEIC.\n\nThe Director-General also held a press briefing on his visit to China and announced the reconvening of the EC the next day. The Director-General based the decision to reconvene on the \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d continued increase in cases and evidence of human-to-human transmission outside China, in addition to the numbers outside China holding the potential for a much larger outbreak, even though they were still relatively small. The Director-General also spoke of his agreement with President Xi Jinping that WHO would lead a team of international experts to visit China as soon as possible to work with the government on increasing the understanding of the outbreak, to guide global response efforts.\n\nWHO held the first of its weekly informal discussions with a group of public health leaders from around the world, in line with its commitment to conducting listening exercises and outreach beyond formal mechanisms.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates reported the first cases in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region. The Regional Director affirmed that the Regional Office continued to monitor disease trends and work with Member States to ensure the ability \u201cto detect and respond to potential cases\u201d.        \n\nThe Pandemic Supply Chain Network (PSCN) created by WHO, in collaboration with the World Economic Forum, held its first meeting. The mission of PSCN is \u201cto create and manage a market network allowing for WHO and private sector partners to access any supply chain functionality and asset from end-to-end anywhere in the world at any scale\u201d.\n\nWHO published advice on the use of masks in the community, during home care and in health care settings.\n\n30 January 2020\nWHO held a Member State briefing to provide more information about the outbreak.\n\nThe WHO Director-General reconvened the IHR Emergency Committee (EC).\n\nThe EC advised the Director-General that the outbreak now met the criteria for a PHEIC. The Director-General accepted the EC\u2019s advice and declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a PHEIC. At that time there were 98 cases and no deaths in 18 countries outside China. Four countries had evidence (8 cases) of human-to-human transmission outside China (Germany, Japan, the United States of America, and Viet Nam).\n\nThe EC formulated advice for the People\u2019s Republic of China, all countries and the global community, which the Director-General accepted and issued as Temporary Recommendations under the IHR. The Director-General gave a statement, providing an overview of the situation in China and globally; the statement also explained the reasoning behind the decision to declare a PHEIC and outlined the EC's recommendations.\n\n31 January 2020\nWHO\u2019s Regional Director for Africa sent out a guidance note to all countries in the Region emphasising the importance of readiness and early detection of cases.\n\n2 February 2020\nFirst dispatch of RT-PCR lab diagnostic kits shipped to WHO Regional Offices.\n\n3 February 2020\nWHO finalised its Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP), centred on improving capacity to detect, prepare and respond to the outbreak. The SPRP translated what had been learned about the virus at that stage into strategic action to guide the development of national and regional operational plans. Its content is structured around how to rapidly establish international coordination, scale up country preparedness and response operations, and accelerate research and innovation.\n\n4 February 2020\nThe WHO Director-General asked the UN Secretary-General to activate the UN crisis management policy, which held its first meeting on 11 February.\n\nDuring the 146th Executive Board, WHO held a technical briefing on the novel coronavirus. In his opening remarks, the Director-General urged Member States to prepare themselves by taking action now, saying \u201cWe have a window of opportunity. While 99% of cases are in China, in the rest of the world we only have 176 cases\u201d.\n\nResponding to a question at the Executive Board, the Secretariat said, \u201cit is possible that there may be individuals who are asymptomatic that shed virus, but we need more detailed studies around this to determine how often that is happening and if this is leading to secondary transmission\u201d.\n\n5 February 2020\nWHO's headquarters began holding daily media briefings on the novel coronavirus, the first time that WHO has held daily briefings by the Director-General or Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme.\n\n9 February 2020\nWHO deployed an advance team for the WHO-China Joint Mission, having received final sign-off from the People\u2019s Republic of China that day. The mission had been agreed between the Director-General and President Xi Jinping during the WHO delegation\u2019s visit to China at the end of January. The advance team completed five days of intensive preparation for the Mission, working with China\u2019s National Health Commission, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, local partners and related entities and the WHO China Country Office. \n\n11 February 2020\nWHO announced that the disease caused by the novel coronavirus would be named COVID-19. Following best practices, the name of the disease was chosen to avoid inaccuracy and stigma and therefore did not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an individual or group of people. \n\n11-12 February 2020\nWHO convened a Global Research and Innovation Forum on the novel coronavirus, attended in person by more than 300 experts and funders from 48 countries, with a further 150 joining online. Participants came together to assess the level of knowledge, identify gaps and work together to accelerate and fund priority research, with equitable access as a fundamental principle underpinning this work.\n\nTopics covered by the Forum included: the origin of the virus, natural history, transmission, diagnosis; epidemiological studies; clinical characterization and management; infection prevention and control; R&D for candidate therapeutics and vaccines; ethical considerations for research; and the integration of the social sciences into the outbreak response.\n\nThe Forum was convened in line with the WHO R&D Blueprint, which was activated to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for this novel coronavirus.\n\n12 February 2020\nSupplementing the SPRP with further detail, WHO published Operational Planning Guidelines to Support Country Preparedness and Response, structured around the eight pillars of country-level coordination, planning, and monitoring; risk communication and community engagement; surveillance, rapid response teams, and case investigation; points of entry; national laboratories; infection prevention and control; case management; and operational support and logistics. These guidelines operationalised technical guidance, such as that published on 10-12 January.\n\n13 February 2020\nWHO\u2019s Digital Solutions Unit convened a roundtable of 30 companies in Silicon Valley to help build support for WHO to keep people safe and informed about COVID-19.\n\n14 February 2020\nBased on lessons learned from the H1N1 and Ebola outbreaks, WHO finalised guidelines for organizers of mass gatherings, in light of COVID-19.\n\n15 February 2020\nThe Director-General spoke at the Munich Security Conference, a global forum dedicated to issues of international security, including health security, where he also held several bilateral meetings\n\nIn his speech, the Director-General made three requests of the international community: use the window of opportunity to intensify preparedness, adopt a whole-of-government approach and be guided by solidarity, not stigma. He also expressed concern at the global lack of urgency in funding the response.\n\n16 February 2020\nThe WHO-China Joint Mission began its work. As part of the mission to assess the seriousness of this new disease; its transmission dynamics; and the nature and impact of China\u2019s control measures, teams made field visits to Beijing, Guangdong, Sichuan and Wuhan.\n\nThe Mission consisted of 25 national and international experts from the People\u2019s Republic of China, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Nigeria, the Russian Federation, Singapore, the United States of America and WHO, all selected after broad consultation to secure the best talent from a diversity of geographies and specialties. It was led by a Senior Advisor to the WHO Director-General, with the Head of Expert Panel of COVID-19 Response at the China National Health Commission (NHC) as co-lead. \n\nThroughout the global outbreak, WHO has regularly sent missions to countries to learn from and support responses, at the request of the affected Member State. Particularly in the early stages of the worldwide COVID-19 response, missions went to countries facing relatively high levels of community transmission, such as the Islamic Republic of Iran, Italy, and Spain.  \n\n19 February 2020\nWeekly WHO Member State Briefings on COVID-19 began, to share the latest knowledge and insights on COVID-19.  \n\n21 February 2020\nThe WHO Director-General appointed six special envoys on COVID-19, to provide strategic advice and high-level political advocacy and engagement in different parts of the world:\n\nProfessor Dr Maha El Rabbat, former Minister of Health of Egypt;\nDr David Nabarro, former special adviser to the UN Secretary-General on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Climate Change;\nDr John Nkengasong, Director of the African Centres for Disease Control and Prevention;\nDr Mirta Roses, former Director of the WHO Region of the Americas;\nDr Shin Young-soo, former Regional Director of the WHO Region of the Western Pacific;\nProfessor Samba Sow, Director-General of the Center for Vaccine Development in Mali.\n24 February 2020\nThe Team Leaders of the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 held a press conference to report on the main findings of the mission.\n\nThe Mission warned that \"much of the global community is not yet ready, in mindset and materially, to implement the measures that have been employed to contain COVID-19 in China\u201d.\n\nThe Mission stressed that \u201cto reduce COVID-19 illness and death, near-term readiness planning must embrace the large-scale implementation of high-quality, non-pharmaceutical public health measures\u201d, such as case detection and isolation, contact tracing and monitoring/quarantining and community engagement.\n\nMajor recommendations were developed for the People\u2019s Republic of China, countries with imported cases and/or outbreaks of COVID-19, uninfected countries, the public and the international community. For example, in addition to the above, countries with imported cases and/or outbreaks were recommended to \"immediately activate the highest level of national Response Management protocols to ensure the all-of-government and all-of-society approach needed to contain COVID-19\".\n\nSuccess was presented as dependent on fast decision-making by top leaders, operational thoroughness by public health systems and societal engagement.\n\nIn addition to the Mission press conference, WHO published operational considerations for managing COVID-19 cases and outbreaks on board ships, following the outbreak of COVID-19 during an international voyage.\n\n25 February 2020\nConfirmation of the second case in WHO's African Region, in Algeria. This followed the earlier reporting of a case in Egypt, the first on the African continent. The Regional Director for Africa called for countries to step up their readiness.\n\n27 February 2020\nWHO published guidance on the rational use of personal protective equipment, in view of global shortages.

            "Text": "There\u2019s a lot of information out there about how governments, health professionals and the general public should respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. WHO has published guidance and advice every step of the way. \n\nDuring health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic, one of WHO\u2019s most vital roles is to gather data and research from around the world, evaluate it, and then advise countries on how to respond.\n\nWHO teams work with experts from around the world to develop this guidance. Together, the experts review reports, studies, presentations by countries, they analyse trends, consult further expert groups and then agree on the best approach. The guidance is meant for health decision makers who adapt the information for their country and context. As new scientific knowledge emerges, the documents are updated.\n\nSince January 2020, WHO has published more than 100 documents about COVID-19. Of these, more than half are detailed technical guidance, on how to find and test cases, how to provide safe and appropriate care for people depending on the severity of their illness, how to trace and quarantine contacts, how to prevent transmission from one person to another, how to protect health care workers, and how to help communities to respond appropriately. Reaching people with the information\nWHO uses many platforms to reach people with the guidance, beyond publishing it online and sharing it directly through networks. It provides resources and regular updates for those working in professional sectors. WHO teams monitor social media and work with technology companies to get ahead of potential waves of misinformation.\n\nWHO holds regular virtual press conferences from its headquarters in Geneva and its 6 regional offices around the world.\n\nAs of July 2020, more than 3.7 million people had enrolled in the OpenWHO platform, which has more than 100 free online courses about COVID-19 in 31 languages, including courses for health workers and other frontline responders.   \n\nBelow is a summary of some of the documents WHO has developed for COVID-19 and how they can be used.\n\nPreparing for an outbreak\nFor many years, WHO has been working with countries to prepare for a global pandemic, and has published guidance to help all countries prepare and brace for future outbreaks.\n\nFor countries where resources are scarce or where there\u2019s risk of overwhelming a fragile health system, WHO has published guidance on COVID-19 preparedness and response in low capacity and humanitarian settings.\n\nBuilding the capacity to find, isolate, test, safely monitor and care for COVID-19 patients is vital, and WHO has published a practical manual and online course detailing how to set up and manage a severe acute respiratory infection treatment centre. The manual covers everything from distancing in waiting areas to ventilation, rational use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the recommended use of transparent surfaces. WHO has also published detailed guidance to help clinicians care for patients with COVID-19. Living through an outbreak\nWHO has outlined detailed guidance on how to find and test cases during different phases of the pandemic. In addition to case finding, contact tracing is essential in tracking and breaking chains of transmission of COVID-19. WHO provides technical guidance on contact tracing explains what constitutes a contact, how to identify contacts and how best to monitor contacts in quarantine.\n\nWhen health systems are overwhelmed, both deaths directly from the outbreak and deaths as a result of vaccine-preventable and treatable conditions increase dramatically. Countries will need to make difficult decisions to balance the demands of responding to COVID-19 with the demands of maintaining the delivery of health services for sufferers of other illnesses. WHO has guidance and a list of actions that countries should consider in order to maintain access to high-quality essential health services for all.\n\nPhysical health injuries may be more noticeable than mental ones, but a global pandemic can have huge adverse effects on people\u2019s mental health too. The booklet on mental health services during COVID-19 offers background and explanations for why maintaining mental health services is crucial in order to avoid a second global health emergency. It offers suggestions on assisting those who may be suffering, particularly those in vulnerable populations like frontline health workers and the ageing population.\n\nManaging and ending an outbreak\nAs some countries look to ease restrictions, it\u2019s important that they have access to all the information needed to ensure changes to behaviour are safe and managed. WHO has provided guidance on when and how to adjust large scale public health and social measures.\n\nWHO has published a list of considerations for decisions about reopening schools. It outlines what questions should be answered before countries determine the status of education facilities. A similar document has been published on health measures in workplaces.\n\nFor densely populated urban centres, a comprehensive guide is available, listing the steps to both prepare for and respond to a potential COVID-19 outbreak. The guide includes real examples from cities around the world that have made necessary changes to their infrastructure in anticipation of an outbreak. Resuming activities during and after an outbreak\nRestricting large gatherings has helped in limiting the spread of the virus. As some countries begin to allow gatherings again, it has never been more important to remain vigilant. For organizers of mass gatherings, the key planning recommendations from WHO outline the necessary precautions and safety measures when hosting large crowds of people.\n\nFor religious gatherings specifically, where close contact with others is common, guidelines have been published that include recommendations around devotion practices and conducting safe burials.\n\nAs restaurants continue to provide people with nourishment, food safety is of utmost importance. WHO has published guidance around food safety, including the use of plastic gloves, social distancing and meal delivery.\n\nThe common thread through the technical guidance is the need for governments to make informed decisions and to clearly communicate with their citizens. While some guidelines are universal \u2013 washing hands, maintaining distance, staying home if unwell with symptoms of COVID\u2013 others require a response tailored to specific contexts. WHO is committed to providing decision-makers with the information they need to make the best decisions for and with their people. The technical guidance library is growing every week as scientific knowledge evolves. If the guidance is applied consistently and correctly, countries can not only learn to prevent and respond to current outbreaks, they can arm themselves with the necessary tools to fight health emergencies for generations to come.",

            "Text": "The identification of any new pathogen, such as the COVID-19 virus, is accompanied by many unknowns, particularly its ability to spread in the human population and its virulence. Initial surveillance strategies focus primarily on the use of molecular testing (RT-PCR) to measure acute infection in patients with severe disease, as these are the individuals who seek and require health care. This may miss the fraction of mild or asymptomatic infections that do not require medical attention, and as such, the full spectrum of the disease is not known. The answers to the questions below are based on our current understanding of the COVID-19 virus and the disease it causes. WHO will continue to update these answers as new information becomes available. Serologic tests measure the antibody response in an individual.  Antibodies to COVID-19 are produced over days to weeks after infection with the virus. The presence of antibodies indicates that a person was infected with the COVID-19 virus, irrespective of whether the individual had severe or mild disease, or even asymptomatic infection.\n\nTo accompany COVID-19 surveillance, seroepidemiologic studies are conducted to measure the extent of infection in the population among people who did not seek health care and were missed by current surveillance efforts because they either had no or mild symptoms. With any novel virus, including the COVID-19 virus, initial seroprevalence in the population is assumed to be negligible due to the virus being novel in origin. Therefore, surveillance of antibody seropositivity in a population can allow inferences to be made about the extent of infection and about the cumulative incidence of infection in the population. No - Currently, no study has evaluated whether the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 confers immunity to subsequent infection by this virus in humans.\n\nThe development of antibodies to a pathogen through natural infection is a multi-step process that typically takes place over 1-2 weeks, but the process to develop a full immunologic response may be longer. Most COVID-19 studies on the presence of antibodies to date show that people who have recovered from infection have antibodies to the virus. However, some of these people have very low levels of antibodies able to neutralize virus in their blood. WHO is providing a global platform for public health professionals and researchers on the use of serology for public health purposes and research in the context of COVID-19.\n\nWHO is working with collaborating laboratories and FIND to develop new and evaluate and validate available serologic assays for COVID-19.  There are currently several hundred immunoassays marketed for COVID-19 including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), rapid immunodiagnostic tests (RDT)s and high throughput automated platforms. The first validation data on ELISAs and RDTs have been published, but the results are based on limited datasets and not all have been conducted with well characterized samples from COVID-19 patients. Laboratories have also developed neutralization tests which require biosafety level 3 facilities.\n\nWithin WHO\u2019s Solidarity II global collaboration, WHO is working partners to facilitate accelerate the development the global sharing of well characterized panels of sera to enable standardization of serologic assays worldwide, and to develop standardized serologic assays for collaborators to use. \n\nIn addition, WHO in collaboration with technical partners, has adapted early epidemiological investigations protocols for COVID-19 from pandemic influenza and from MERS-CoV to better understand these characteristics and how they may be used to inform public health measures. These are called the Unity studies and WHO is currently working with more than 40 countries to implement these studies:\n\nFirst few X case and contacts\nHealth worker seroepidemiologic investigation of risk factors for infection\nHousehold transmission study\nAge-stratified population based serologic study The results from seroepidemiologic investigations, whether individually or pooled across study sites/countries, will help to understand and provide robust estimates of key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of COVID-19 virus, including:\n\nKey epidemiological parameters, including: secondary infection rate and secondary clinical attack rate of COVID-19 infection among close contacts, asymptomatic fraction of infection, serial interval and incubation period of COVID-19, the basic reproduction number (R0) and Rt of COVID-19 virus.\nClinical presentation of COVID-19 infection and course of associated disease\nRisk factors for transmission and infection and identification of possible routes of transmission\nImpact of infection prevention and control measures in health care settings\nSerological response following symptomatic COVID-19 infection.\nAge-stratified seroprevalence of COVID-19 virus\nCumulative incidence of infection, including extent of age-specific infection\nInfection and disease-severity ratios (case\u2011hospitalization ratio [CHR] and case-fatality ratio [CFR]). WHO is in regular contact with countries that are implementing the Unity studies, participating in the Solidarity II study, or that are conducting seroepidemiologic studies using their own study protocols. We have established communication between partners in countries to carry out studies to share experiences, challenges and successes and discuss results as they become available.\n\nEarly results from population based serologic studies are becoming available now, with more expected across the weeks to follow. As early results become available, it is important to understand the population involved in the study, what samples were tested, how and when samples were collected, which serologic assay(s) were used and how the authors interpreted the results. \n\nAt the current time, the biggest uncertainty remains the performance of serologic tests in terms of sensitivity and specificity, which should also assess cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses such as human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as how well the correlate with protective immunity (protection against re-infection). Early results from Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, Denmark, the United States of America, Switzerland, Finland, Japan, Italy, China, Spain, Brazil, Croatia, Andorra and Luxembourg have shown that for most populations under study, the extent of infection is below 10%, with the exception of: one German study (14%), a report among first responders in New York State (10-17%), and two pre-print papers from Trieste, Italy (17.2%) and blood donors and children in London (11.3%). There are now four peer-reviewed publications online: one from non-COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China,[1] one in community and hospital settings across different regions in China,[2] one in the general population in Boise, Idaho,[3] and one among residents of Hong Kong.[4]  The remaining studies have not yet completed the peer-review process and some are only available on pre-print servers with the rest reported as press releases with minimal information. The results from the early seroepidemiologic studies, acknowledging the limitations described above, indicate that few people have evidence of infection thus far.  This suggests that many people remain susceptible to infection, which is important in planning for subsequent resurgence in infection. Herd immunity is the indirect protection from an infectious disease that happens when a population is immune either through vaccination or immunity developed through previous infection. This means that even people who haven\u2019t been infected, or in whom an infection hasn\u2019t triggered an immune response, they are protected because people around them who are immune can act as buffers between them and an infected person. The threshold for establishing herd immunity for COVID-19 is not yet clear. Some governments have suggested that the detection of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, could serve as the basis for an \u201cimmunity passport\u201d or \u201crisk-free certificate\u201d that would enable individuals to travel or to return to work assuming that they are protected against re-infection. At this point in the pandemic, there is not enough evidence about the effectiveness of antibody-mediated immunity to guarantee the accuracy of an \u201cimmunity passport\u201d or \u201crisk-free certificate.\u201d That is, there is currently no evidence to determine whether or not people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.",

This includes avoid hugging, kissing, or shaking hands. If you can\u2019t guarantee the distance, wear a fabric mask. Be sure to check local and national guidelines on the use of masks.\nStaying behind plexiglass boards at reception and concierge desks can prevent droplet transmission.\n\nTeleworking may be a possibility for some jobs, which can help reduce physical contact with others. \n\n\n\nShould staff wear a mask while working?\nIn areas where the virus that causes COVID-19 is circulating, staff aged 60 or over, or who have any underlying health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes or lung cancer, should wear a medical mask because of their higher risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19.\n\nStaff under the age of 60 and who are in general good health can wear fabric masks when they cannot guarantee at least a 1 metre distance from others. This is particularly important for staff who are in close contact or potential close contact with others. Everyone should follow local policies and regulations.\n\n\n\nWhat should staff do if a guest becomes sick at an accommodation establishment?\nIf a guest at the accommodation develops symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, dry cough or tiredness, staff at the accommodation establishment should contact the local health authority and follow their instructions. The sick person should be isolated in a room, alone, or at least 1 metre away from others, according to local health authorities\u2019 instructions. No visitors should be permitted to enter the room occupied by the affected guest. Staff should also move people traveling with the sick person to a different room, if possible.\n\nIt is usually the relevant public health authority, not the management of the hotel and accommodation establishment, which has the authority to demand sick guests to temporarily remain in their room or to prevent them from receiving visits from other guests. National law will guide the rights of the guests to refuse or not the recommended measures.\n\nStaff entering the room of an ill person should maintain at least a 1 metre distance from the ill person, and request that the ill person put on a medical mask. \n\nIf staff need to assist an ill guest within a 1 metre distance, they should clean their hands before putting on appropriate personal protective equipment (medical mask and eye protection, gloves and isolation gown), and clean their hands after providing assistance. Training should be provided on how to avoid contaminating themselves.\n\n\n\nWhat should staff do if they have symptoms?\nIf staff develop COVID-19 symptoms while at work, such as fever, dry cough or tiredness, they should immediately stop working, put on a medical mask and isolate in a suitable room while medical services are notified. Disposable tissues and an appropriate waste bin with a lid should be available in the designated isolation area while waiting for medical assessment or transfer to an assessment facility.\n\nIf staff develop symptoms while at home, they should stay at home and seek medical attention, following instructions from a health worker that will include a period of time for self-isolation away from others, including family members, according to local guidance.  The staff member should inform the management accordingly.",

WHO has contributed to guidance on ventilation and air-conditioning systems in the context of COVID-19, available here.\n\nWHO works closely with the World Meteorological Organization Joint Office for Climate and Health and the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Global Heat Health Information Network to develop and update this guidance. Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are used to maintain indoor air temperature and humidity at healthy and comfortable levels. A well-maintained and operated system can reduce the spread of COVID-19 in indoor spaces by increasing the rate of  air change, reducing recirculation of air and increasing the use of outdoor air. Recirculation modes (which recirculate the air) should not be used. HVAC systems should be regularly inspected, maintained, and cleaned. At home, table or pedestal fans are safe for air circulation among family members living together who are not infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, fans should be avoided when people who are not part of the immediate family are visiting, since some people could have the virus despite not having symptoms. Air blowing from an infected person directly at another in closed spaces may increase the transmission of the virus from one person to another. \n\nAt home, offices or school, if the use of table or pedestal fan is unavoidable, it is important to increase outdoor air changes by opening windows and minimize the air blowing from one person (or group of people) to another person (or group of people).\n\nThe use of ceiling fans can improve circulation of outside air and avoid pockets of stagnant air in occupied space. However, it is critical to maintain good outdoor ventilation when using ceiling fans.  An efficient way to increase outdoor air exchange is by opening windows. Some airplanes have cabin air filtration systems equipped with HEPA filters which can remove viruses and germs quickly, minimizing the duration of the exposure to any potential infectious materials produced by a cough or sneeze. The cabin air system is designed to operate most efficiently by delivering approximately 50 percent outside air and 50 percent filtered, recirculated air. The air supply is essentially sterile and particle-free.  However, adequate ventilation is just one of the preventive measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.  Other important measures include maintaining physical distance of at least 1 meter whenever possible, frequent hand hygiene and wearing a mask. Passengers should check with the airline company and the national or local guidelines about when and where to wear a mask while flying.",

The list is not exhaustive but focuses on evaluation of quality, safety and efficacy of vaccines. Some WHO guidelines may also be applicable for other COVID-19 interventions such as biological therapeutic products (e.g. antibodies). Details regarding the applicability of existing WHO documents for various types of vaccines such as Ebola, RSV etc. are provided to assist national regulatory authorities and manufacturers of vaccines and other biologicals.\n\nRelevant WHO documents for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and other biologicals\n\nIn addition, revision of WHO Guidelines for assuring the quality, safety, and efficacy of plasmid DNA vaccines has been undertaken before COVID-19 pandemic and updated draft will be considered by ECBS at its meeting during 24-28 August 2020.\n\nMeasurement standards\nCurrently a variety of molecular and serological assays are in use in worldwide settings for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection and for measurement of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. The availability of international standards for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibody will facilitate development, validation and assessment of the assays and allow for comparability of results from different assays, thus eventually facilitate and harmonize evaluation of diagnostics, vaccines and other products.\n\nThe WHO collaborating center for biological standardization, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC), UK, is leading the projects listed below with the support of other WHO Collaborating centers and worldwide laboratories. The aim is to make the reference reagents available at the end of 2020, with an accelerated timeframe of 9 months, instead of the usual time of 2-3 years.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19)-related research reagents available from the NIBSC\n\nOngoing projects (Updates as of 19 August 2020):\nDeveloping 1st WHO International Standard for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody and Reference Panel\nThe ongoing collaborative study which was commenced on 1 July 2020 involves 51 laboratories from 14 countries worldwide, including governmental/regulatory agencies, WHO collaborating centres, vaccine manufacturers (including three with candidates in phase 3 clinical trial, three in phase 1/2, and three in phase 1), clinical laboratories, kit manufacturers and academic laboratories. The methods to be used include: ELISA (in-house methods directed against several epitopes and commercial kits for detection of IgG, IgM and IgA); neutralization assays (either using a live SARS-CoV-2 virus or a pseudotyped-based system); commercial kits for point-of-care detection of antibodies and surface plasmon resonance. It is expected that all participating labs return their results by September, statistical analysis and report be completed in October, submission to WHO ECBS at the beginning of November for consideration in its ad hoc meeting in December 2020. This project has been supported by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).  \n\nDeveloping 1st WHO International Standard for SARS-CoV-2 RNA\nThe ongoing collaborative study which was commenced on 20 July 2020 involves 27 laboratories from 10 countries worldwide including governmental/regulatory agencies, WHO collaborating centres, clinical and academic laboratories, diagnostic kit manufacturers. In-house assays directed against multiple targets and commercial kits either based on a real-time PCR or digital PCR will be used in the study. It is expected that all participating labs return their results by mid-October; statistical analysis and report be completed at the end of October with submission to WHO ECBS at the beginning of November for consideration in its ad hoc meeting in December 2020.",

More than 7 million of these deaths are from direct tobacco use and around 1.2 million are due to non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke.\n\nTobacco smoking is a known risk factor for many respiratory infections and increases the severity of respiratory diseases. A review of studies by public health experts convened by WHO on 29 April 2020 found that smokers are more likely to develop severe disease with COVID-19, compared to non-smokers.\n\nCOVID-19 is an infectious disease that primarily attacks the lungs. Smoking impairs lung function making it harder for the body to fight off coronaviruses and other diseases. Tobacco is also a major risk factor for noncommunicable diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, respiratory disease and diabetes which put people with these conditions at higher risk for developing severe illness when affected by COVID-19. Available research suggests that smokers are at higher risk of developing severe disease and death.\n\nWHO is constantly evaluating new research, including research that examines the link between tobacco use, nicotine use, and COVID-19. WHO urges researchers, scientists and the media to be cautious about amplifying unproven claims that tobacco or nicotine could reduce the risk of COVID-19.  There is currently insufficient information to confirm any link between tobacco or nicotine in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.\n\nNicotine replacement therapies, such as gum and patches are designed to help smokers quit tobacco. WHO recommends that smokers take immediate steps to quit by using proven methods such as toll-free quit lines, mobile text-messaging programmes, and nicotine replacement therapies. \n\nWithin 20 minutes of quitting, elevated heart rate and blood pressure drop. After 12 hours, the carbon monoxide level in the bloodstream drops to normal. Within 2-12 weeks, circulation improves and lung function increases. After 1-9 months, coughing and shortness of breath decrease.\n\nWHO stresses the importance of ethically approved, high-quality, systematic research that will contribute to advancing individual and public health, emphasizing that promotion of unproven interventions could have a negative effect on health.",

            "Text": "Since the beginning of the outbreak, health care providers have been shown more support, solidarity and gratitude than they ever have. Yet, attacks on health care have continuously been reported and now also include incidents linked to the COVID-19 pandemic across the world.\n\nThis unprecedented public health emergency has demonstrated that health facilities, medical transport, patients as well as health care workers and their families can \u2013 and do \u2013 become targets everywhere. This alarming trend reinforces the need for improved measures to protect health care from acts of violence. During the COVID-19 pandemic more than ever, protecting the health and lives of health care providers on the frontline is critical to enabling a better global response.\n\nThis page provides information about the essence of COVID-19-related attacks, their impact on the response, the role of stigma in driving them and, finally, a brief overview of actions taken to minimize their impact.\n\n\nDefining attacks on health care\nEnsuring access to health services is the cornerstone of a successful health response. Any verbal or physical act of violence, obstruction or threat that interferes with the availability, access and delivery of such services is defined as attack on health care by the World Health Organization (WHO). \n\nAs shown in the inforgraphic below, the nature of attacks on health care related to COVID-19 varies greatly across contexts and can range from the use of heavy weapons targeting health facilities to the stigmatization of health care workers. Ultimately \u2013 whether they take the form of a cyber attack or a physical assault \u2013 they deprive people of urgently needed care, endanger health care providers, and undermine health systems. Impact on the response\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has put some health systems under immense pressure and stretched others beyond their capacity. As such, responding to this public health emergency and successfully minimizing its impact requires every health resource to be leveraged. Failure to protect health care in this rapidly changing context exposes health systems to critical gaps in services when they are most needed, and can have a long-lasting impact on the health and wellbeing of populations.\n\nIn fragile and conflict-affected countries, acts of violence during the COVID-19 pandemic have already deprived hundreds of medical services and severely hindered the response. Among others, the bombardment and destruction of a 400-bed facility in Libya1 (United Nations, 2020) further reduced the ability of health authorities and aid agencies to prepare for a full-blown epidemic.\n\nIn other countries where attacks on health care have been noticed, the COVID-19 pandemic has sometimes created hostile environments for health care providers who have reported incidents of violence, discrimination and harassment. Stigmatized as vectors of contagion in many countries, some have been assaulted, others were denied transport while commuting to work, and entire families were evicted from their homes. Furthermore, reports of attacks on medical vehicles carrying COVID-19 samples, on-duty COVID-19 drivers as well as patients are accumulating and raising concerns worldwide. \n\nHowever, attacks on health care not only have a direct impact on the ability of health systems to deliver services to those most in need, but also take a heavy toll on the psychosocial health of patients, critical health care providers on the frontline and their families. As those continue to be targeted by acts of violence during this public health emergency, health systems must \u2013 among other things \u2013 prepare for shortages of health care workers unwilling or unable to report to work due to unsafe environments or obstruction in their personal lives.\n\n\nThe role of stigma\nActs of violence related to the COVID-19 pandemic take place against the backdrop of growing social stigma and discriminatory behaviours against anyone perceived to have been in contact with the virus. Health resources, patients, health care providers and their family members are at particularly high risk of experiencing attacks due to the wrongful belief that they have become vectors of contagion in a community.\n\nCOVID-19 misinformation plays an important role in shaping such beliefs and behaviours across the world. The \u2018infodemic\u2019 of false information about the disease exacerbates fear of contagion, misconceptions and myths about the virus. Amid growing mistrust, health care providers increasingly come to be seen as a risk to communities rather than the solution to this public health emergency. To illustrate, health care workers have reported being spat on, called \u2018contagious rat\u2019, assaulted after boarding public transports, having their belongings vandalized and their children discriminated against by their classmates.\n\nThese attacks on health care speak to the importance of adequate risk communication at all levels of society to reduce fear, stigma and \u2013 ultimately \u2013 violence. How we communicate about COVID-19 is critical in supporting people to take effective action to combat the disease and protect health care. Responding to attacks\nDuring the pandemic, the international community, governments and civil society have taken the first steps to protect health systems by addressing attacks on health care as well as their roots.\n\nTo stop attacks on vital infrastructure such as health facilities and water and sanitation systems, the international community has called for ceasefires in conflict-affected areas. Some national and local governments introduced new policies to protect health care, including in India where perpetrators are punishable with prison terms up to 7 years. In Mexico, some cities have implemented dedicated transport services for health care workers after many were refused entry on public buses.\n\nDoctors\u2019 associations across the world have also initiated talks with authorities to make their work environment safe from infections and to better protect health care providers outside the hospital. Through its Health Care in Danger initiative, the International Committee of the Red Cross published a checklist for a safer COVID-19 response addressed to managers of health-care services, individual practitioners and health policymakers. WHO and partners are also conducting communication and outreach campaigns at country-level to support governments in addressing attacks on health care.\n\nWHO, governments and the international community have also taken measures to address stigma around COVID-19. In addition to regular social media campaigns, the Government of the United Kingdom and WHO launched the collaborative campaign \u2018Stop the Spread\u2019 to raise awareness about the dangers of misinformation across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. WHO has also made available a COVID-19 risk communication package for healthcare facilities, as well as dedicated risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) guidance for countries, and a guide for governments, the media and local organization to prevent and address social stigma.\n\nWHO continues to collect information and data to improve our understanding of COVID-19 related attacks, inform its network of partners and document good practices.",

The city of Athens followed these measures while also moving quickly to bring experts together from all sectors to protect marginalised communities.\n\nThey knew that these strict measures would heavily impact vulnerable groups who would face isolation, disruption to treatment and rehabilitation services, and reduced access to social programmes. These groups were also at higher risk of getting COVID-19 and having a more severe case, due to higher rates of noncommunicable diseases.\n\n\u201cThese very harsh times have taught us that the best outcome always comes with collaboration and consistent efforts. When city and civil society join efforts, the result is more than fruitful, as together we can open an ever-safer umbrella towards marginalized populations.

From March, the Partnership expanded to urgently address the pandemic, as cities are playing a vital role in the response to COVID-19.\n\nAthens city authorities, together with the Hellenic Liver Patients Association \u201cPrometheus\u201d, the Greek Association of People Living with HIV \u201cPositive Voice\u201d and funding from the Partnership for Healthy Cities were able to strengthen support to get essential supplies and health information to marginalised communities during the pandemic.\n\nThrough the project trained staff and volunteers in Athens distribute food, water, gloves, masks, antiseptic liquid, and information about COVID-19 to those affected by homelessness, people who inject drugs, sex workers and migrants. The informational flyers provided life-saving public health advice on how to protect yourself from COVID-19. The city also created temporary housing for more than 400 people affected by homelessness and a specialised support centre for people who inject drugs.\n\n\u201cWHO supports Greece with advocacy and evidence-based policy guidance for COVID-19 and beyond. The \u2018whole-of-society\u2019 approach leaves no one behind and amplifies the best of social norms while creating a new positive normal that minimizes stigma and discrimination,\u201d emphasized Marianna Trias, WHO representative for Greece.\n\nThe Versatile Center for Homeless People combines accommodation with health and social care services to promote the physical and mental health of participants. The Centre also offers a day service, where residents can access personal hygiene facilities, a healthy meal and internet, in addition to a space for resting. In April, Athens opened a second, more specialised, centre for people who inject drugs. The centre offers temporary accommodation alongside drug treatment and rehabilitation services.\n\nIn recognising and addressing the needs of marginalised groups during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the city of Athens is promoting health equity and building a more just city. These programmes reflect progress in tackling the long-standing challenges of homelessness and substance use and improving access to health for hard to reach groups.\n\nCities must build on the successes and innovation born out of the pandemic to catalyse progress towards ensuring the right to health for all.",

In the most remote villages reside indigenous communities who need access to effective primary health care. This is just one of the many challenges that Suriname\u2019s health system faces. COVID-19 has further highlighted its small health workforce: just eight physicians and 23 nurses per 10,000 people, health infrastructure that is still being developed and limited emergency response capacity, among others.  \n\nUHC Partnership support for COVID-19 \nSince the start of 2020, WHO, through the UHC Partnership, has expanded its support in strengthening Suriname\u2019s health system with the goal of helping the country achieve universal health coverage. With funding from the European Union, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Irish Aid, the Government of Japan, the French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs, the UK Department for International Development and Belgium, the Partnership has been supporting work in four main areas: saving lives, protecting health care workers, slowing the spread of the virus and strengthening epidemic intelligence. Suriname\u2019s experience in preparing for COVID-19 and its urgent actions to keep its population safe has also brought a unique opportunity to chart a new path for public health in the country.  \n\nLooking forward, WHO will continue to support Suriname in building a resilient health system and to develop and maintain capacities to prevent, detect and respond to future outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics.",

It is done to maintain the quality of air in that space.\n\n\n\nWhat is WHO doing to address ventilation in the context of COVID-19?\nWHO has contributed to guidance on ventilation and air-conditioning systems in the context of COVID-19, available here.\n\nWHO works closely with the World Meteorological Organization Joint Office for Climate and Health and the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Global Heat Health Information Network to develop and update this guidance.\n\nWhat steps can be undertaken to improve the ventilation in indoor public spaces and buildings?\nVentilation is an important factor in preventing the virus that causes COVID-19 from spreading indoors.  Below are steps to consider which can improve indoor ventilation. These steps should be considered in consultation with a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) professional.\n\nConsider using natural ventilation, opening windows if possible and safe to do so.\nFor mechanical systems, increase the percentage of outdoor air, using economizer modes of HVAC operations and potentially as high as 100%. Before increasing outdoor air percentage, verify compatibility with HVAC system capabilities for both temperature and humidity control as well as compatibility with outdoor/indoor air quality considerations.\nIncrease total airflow supply to occupied spaces, if possible.\nDisable demand-control ventilation controls that reduce air supply based on temperature or occupancy.\nImprove central air filtration:\nIncrease air filtration to as high as possible without significantly diminishing design airflow.\nInspect filter housing and racks to ensure appropriate filter fit and check for ways to minimize filter bypass.\nConsider running the HVAC system at maximum outside airflow for 2 hours before and after spaces are occupied, in accordance with manufactory recommendations.\nGenerate clean-to-less-clean air movements by re-evaluating the positioning of supply and exhaust air diffusers and/or dampers and adjusting zone supply and exhaust flow rates to establish measurable pressure differentials. Have staff work in \u201cclean\u201d ventilation zones that do not include higher-risk areas such as visitor reception or exercise facilities (if open).\nEnsure exhaust fans in restroom facilities are functional and operating at full capacity when the building is occupied.\n\n\nAre there any recommendations for offices, schools and the accommodation sector regarding ventilation and air conditioning use?\nIn all workplaces, schools and tourist accommodations, there should be fresh, clean air. WHO recommends an increased ventilation rate through natural or mechanical means, preferably without recirculation of the air. In case of air recirculation, filters should be cleaned regularly, especially for jobs that place an individual at a medium or high risk of exposure to COVID-19. Examples of such jobs may include frontline workers in retail, tourist accommodation and domestic workers.",

            "Text": "With Taiwan, China now off the list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS, the human-to-human chain of transmission of this new disease appears to be broken globally.\n\nThe chain of transmission is considered broken at an outbreak site when 20 days have passed since the last probable case was placed in isolation, left the area, or died. If no further cases are detected during these 20 days, despite sensitive surveillance, the virus can be considered banished from its human host.\n\nIn late June, WHO announced that Hong Kong* and Beijing, the world\u2019s two most severely affected areas, had interrupted transmission. Toronto and Taiwan followed shortly afterwards, with Taiwan removed on 5 July.\n\nAt all outbreak sites around the world, the SARS virus has been pushed back out of its new human host. This is a striking achievement for an especially dangerous and poorly understood new disease, which was unheard of four months ago.\n\nHowever, the world must remain vigilant for SARS. The resurgence in late May of cases in Toronto, where the disease was thought to have been contained, is a sobering reminder of the resilience of SARS and its capacity to deliver surprises.\n\nThe earliest \u2013 and most mysterious \u2013 chains\nThe earliest cases are now known to have occurred in mid-November in Guangdong Province, China. SARS was first carried out into the world at large on 21 February, when an infected medical doctor from Guangdong checked into room 911 on the 9th floor of the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong.\n\nThat single hotel floor became the setting, in ways that remain mysterious, for the international spread of SARS. At least 14 guests and visitors carried the virus with them to the hospital systems of Toronto, Hong Kong, Viet Nam, and Singapore. Most recently, an additional two guests from the UK, who subsequently fell ill and were hospitalized in the Philippines, were shown to have been infected with SARS when tested upon their return home. For reasons that remain unclear, these two patients were the only guests infected during their stay at the Hong Kong hotel who did not spark large outbreaks elsewhere.\n\nThe earliest and most severe outbreaks \u2013 in Toronto, Hong Kong, Viet Nam, and Singapore \u2013 were all seeded by visitors to the hotel. At that time, prior to the first global alert issued by WHO on 12 March, no one was aware that a severe new disease, capable of rapidly spreading in hospitals, had emerged. Hospital staff responding to the earliest cases failed to protect themselves from infection as they aggressively fought to save lives.\n\nAs a result, the disease rapidly spread within hospitals, infecting staff, other patients, and visitors, and then spilled out into the larger community as family members and their close contacts became infected. As the outbreaks grew in size, the number of exported cases rose, with 30 countries and areas eventually reporting cases. Dr Carlo Urbani, WHO expert on communicable diseases, died of SARS on March 29 2003. Dr Urbani was the first to identify SARS in Viet Nam. His swift actions led to a heightened global awareness that ultimately saved many lives.\nWHO and country health officials had to act rapidly. Tracking these chains of transmission became one of the key measures for controlling the outbreaks. In Singapore, for example, five patients were determined to account for 103 of the total 206 cases in the outbreak.\n\nOther measures to stem the outbreak included rapid detection and isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts, and travel restrictions. Case detection was further improved by the opening of hundreds of fever clinics and use of the mass media to encourage people to check for fever several times a day.\n\nFollowing the WHO global alert, and a stronger emergency travel advisory issued by WHO on 15 March, almost all countries experiencing imported cases have been able to either prevent any further transmission or keep the number of additional cases very small. This has been possible through heightened awareness of the symptoms to watch for and the actions to take.\n\nTaiwan, China, the sole exception, experienced an explosion of cases following a lapse in infection control procedures in a single hospital \u2013 yet another example of how unforgiving SARS can be.\n\nSARS is the first severe and easily transmissible new disease to emerge in the 21st century. Its containment, however, has been achieved through the diligent application of control measures from centuries past. In the final analysis, it will be these old-fashioned measures that defeat SARS \u2013 at least for now.\n\nRemaining questions\nThe most pressing question at present is whether SARS will return. Like the Ebola virus, whose origins have never been discovered, the SARS virus could hide in some animal or environmental reservoir, only to resurface once conditions again become ripe for spread to its new human host. SARS might also behave like many other respiratory diseases of viral origin, dying out as heat and humidity rise and returning when the season turns cooler.\n\nFor this reason, WHO will be moving soon from an emergency-based response effort to a research agenda focused on answering this and many other critical questions. For example, it is possible that transmission could continue to occur, even after all known chains of transmission have been broken, at a level so low that it defies detection until the disease once again flares up in an outbreak.\n\nFor now, however, WHO\u2019s first objective of sealing off opportunities for further international spread appears close to becoming a reality.",

It was first identified at the end of February 2003 during an outbreak that emerged in China and spread to 4 other countries. WHO co-ordinated the international investigation with the assistance of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) and worked closely with health authorities in affected countries to provide epidemiological, clinical and logistical support and to bring the outbreak under control.\n\nSARS is an airborne virus and can spread through small droplets of saliva in a similar way to the cold and influenza. It was the first severe and readily transmissible new disease to emerge in the 21st century and showed a clear capacity to spread along the routes of international air travel.\n\nSARS can also be spread indirectly via surfaces that have been touched by someone who is infected with the virus.\n\nMost patients identified with SARS were previously healthy adults aged 25\u201370 years. A few suspected cases of SARS have been reported among children under 15 years. The case fatality among persons with illness meeting the current WHO case definition for probable and suspected cases of SARS is around 3%. The incubation period of SARS is usually 2-7 days but may be as long as 10 days.\n\nThe first symptom of the illness is generally fever (>38\u00b0C), which is often high, and sometimes associated with chills and rigors. It may also be accompanied by other symptoms including headache, malaise, and muscle pain. At the onset of illness, some cases have mild respiratory symptoms. Typically, rash and neurologic or gastrointestinal findings are absent, although a few patients have reported diarrhoea during the early febrile stage.\n\nAfter 3-7 days, a lower respiratory phase begins with the onset of a dry, non-productive cough or dyspnoea (shortness of breath) that may be accompanied by, or progress to, hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels). In 10\u201320% of cases, the respiratory illness is severe enough to require intubation and mechanical ventilation. Chest radiographs may be normal throughout the course of illness, though not for all patients. The white blood cell count is often decreased early in the disease, and many people have low platelet counts at the peak of the disease. There is no cure or vaccine for SARS and treatment should be supportive and based on the patient\u2019s symptoms.\n\nControlling outbreaks relies on containment measures including:\n\nprompt detection of cases through good surveillance networks and including an early warning system;\nisolation of suspected of probably cases;\ntracing to identify both the source of the infection and contacts of those who are sick and may be at risk of contracting the virus;\nquarantine of suspected contacts for 10 days;\nexit screening for outgoing passengers from areas with recent local transmission by asking questions and temperature measurement; and\ndisinfection of aircraft and cruise vessels having SARS cases on board using WHO guidelines.\nPersonal preventive measures to prevent spread of the virus include frequent hand washing using soap or alcohol-based disinfectants. For those with a high risk of contracting the disease, such as health care workers, use of personal protective equipment, including a mask, goggles and an apron is mandatory.  Whenever possible, household contacts should also wear a mask.",

The speed at which this virus was identified is the result of the close international collaboration of 13 laboratories from 10 countries. While many lines of evidence have found strong associations between this virus and the disease over the last weeks, final confirmation came today.\n\n\u201cThe pace of SARS research has been astounding,\u201d said Dr. David Heymann, Executive Director, WHO Communicable Diseases programmes. \u201cBecause of an extraordinary collaboration among laboratories from countries around the world, we now know with certainty what causes SARS.\u201d\n\nThe successful identification of the coronavirus means that scientists can now confidently turn to other SARS challenges. For example, various laboratories continue to work to unravel the genetic information of the SARS virus and compare the sequences obtained from viruses in different parts of the world. Experts are gathering at WHO this week to map future work on SARS.\n\n\u201cToday, the collaboration continues as top laboratory researchers have come to WHO to design the next steps, a strategy for transforming these basic research discoveries into diagnostic tools which will help us to successfully control this disease,\u201d said Heymann. \u201cNow we can move away from methods like isolation and quarantines and move aggressively towards modern intervention strategies including specific treatments and eventually vaccination. With the establishment of the causative agent, we are a crucial step closer.\u201d\n\nThis collaboration has brought together leading scientific expertise, and was established after WHO issued a global alert on SARS on 12 March 2003. The priority has been to find the cause and to develop diagnostic tests. Two laboratories in China recently joined this network of laboratories from Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.\n\n\u201cToday, the first part of the mission of our network has been fulfilled, as researchers have both detected a hitherto unknown virus and established it as the cause of SARS. The new coronavirus has been named by WHO and member laboratories as \u201cSARS virus, \u201d said Dr Albert Osterhaus, the Director of Virology at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam. Erasmus completed the work to definitely prove that the new coronavirus causes SARS.\n\nOver the past three weeks, due to the urgency surrounding the worldwide threat to health of SARS and early indications this was a new member of the coronavirus family, research has proceeded under the assumption that SARS was caused by a new coronavirus.\n\nThe 13 laboratories have been working on meeting Koch\u2019s postulates, necessary to prove disease causation. These postulates stipulate that to be the causal agent, a pathogen must meet four conditions: it must be found in all cases of the disease, it must be isolated from the host and grown in pure culture, it must reproduce the original disease when introduced into a susceptible host, and it must be found in the experimental host so infected.\n\nCredit for the coronavirus findings, which definitively pinpoints the cause of SARS, is attributed to the 13 laboratories, working in conjunction with WHO.\n\n\u201cThe people in this network have put aside profit and prestige to work together to find the cause of this new disease and to find way new ways of fighting it,\u201d said Dr Klaus St\u00f6hr, WHO virologist and the coordinator of the collaborative research network. \u201cIn this globalized world, such collaboration is the only way forward in tackling emerging diseases.\u201d\n\nWHO and the network of laboratories dedicate their detection and characterization of the SARS virus to Dr Carlo Urbani, the WHO scientist who first alerted the world to the existence of SARS in Hanoi, Vietnam, and who died from the disease in Bangkok on 29 March 2003.",

            "Text": "Inadequate plumbing is likely to have been a contributor to the spread of SARS in residential buildings in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, a World Health Organization (WHO) technical Consultation concluded today. It also contributes to the spread of a number of other infectious diseases in several other countries. In the absence of proper maintenance and without consistent monitoring, reviewing, enforcing and updating of building standards and practices, inadequate plumbing and sewage systems could continue to enhance the potential of SARS and some other diseases to spread. The meeting concluded that it would be relatively easy to interrupt and avoid some diseases, including SARS if it were to return.\n\nThe Consultation developed a checklist of environmental hygiene factors in building design and maintenance that, if followed, could contribute to controlling environmental transmission of SARS Coronavirus (CoV) and other viruses. Viruses that can be transmitted by the \u201cfaecal droplet\u201d route also include gastro-enteritis virus (such as Norwalk-like viruses), some adenoviruses and enteroviruses responsible for a number of gastro-intestinal and neurological diseases.\n\n\u201cWith this Consultation, WHO is helping its Member States appreciate the need to assess and manage the health risks associated with inadequate plumbing and sewage systems. It has documented lessons learned, it has pointed to risk assessment and management tools to be better prepared in case of future outbreaks and it has listed concrete measures and regulatory frameworks for the prevention of faecal droplet transmission of disease-causing viruses, This information will be brought together in a guidelines document,\u201d commented Dr Jamie Bartram, Head of WHO\u2019s Water, Sanitation and Health Programme at its Geneva headquarters.\n\nIt has been suggested that the \u201cfaecal droplet\u201d route may have been one of several modes of transmission in Hong Kong during the SARS outbreak in early 2003. In this case, droplets originating from virus-rich excreta in a given building\u2019s drainage system re-entered into resident\u2019s apartments via sewage and drainage systems where there were strong upward air flows, inadequate \u201ctraps\u201d and non-functional water seals.\n\nMeeting in Rome, an international group of WHO experts reviewed the transmission risks related to the current state of plumbing systems around the world and how inadequate construction and maintenance practices could contribute to the spread of SARS.\n\n\u201cIn many countries there will be buildings where keeping sewage separate from building occupants is a critical challenge,\u201d observed Dr Bartram. \u201cThis could result in harmful viruses, including the SARS Coronavirus (CoV), being sucked from the sewage system into the home if, for example, there are strong extractor fans working in a family\u2019s bathroom. Fortunately, solutions are simple and already in place in most areas world-wide, but there remain places where short-cuts in design, construction and maintenance continue to compromise safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the evidence suggests that, under most circumstances, the spread of SARS among people occurred overwhelmingly across a short range of distance through water droplets, there are specific situations where conditions allowed other transmission routes. One of these is through sewage-associated faecal droplets and this Consultation has, therefore, recommended measures to reduce sewage-borne transmission routes of pathogenic viruses,\u201d added Dr Bartram.\n\nThe Consultation emphasized that the solution \u2013 proper plumbing \u2013 is a simple public health measure which is often overlooked but can be addressed at minimal extra cost. Nevertheless, it is a significant tool in stopping faecal droplet transmission of disease.\n\nThe Consultation resolved that Governments establish or strengthen intersectoral arrangements and mechanisms to enhance joint efforts of ministries of health, building authorities, local governments and architects/designers to both raise general awareness of the risks from inadequate plumbing and sewage systems, and to take concrete actions to address shortcomings in this area.\n\nThe experts meeting at the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health in Rome came from nine countries and represented the fields of epidemiology, virology, environmental health, risk assessment/management, building design and plumbing.",

Those in high risk groups include the elderly, people with weakened immune systems and those with underlying chronic diseases. WHO is also urging increased vaccination coverage in health care workers who have frequent contact with these vulnerable populations.\n\nThese WHO recommendations are especially aimed at reducing the number of cases in these high-risk groups, where influenza often leads to severe pneumonia and other serious illness due to pre-existing chronic diseases. In addition, reducing pneumonia cases may also lower the possibility of misdiagnosing influenza as SARS.\n\nBecause vaccine stocks are limited, there is a need for prioritization. For this reason, WHO recommends that priority for influenza vaccination be given to the elderly, those with chronic diseases, and others including health care workers who have frequent contact with these high risk groups.\n\nMany respiratory diseases occur every winter but influenza is one of the most severe. Influenza typically infects 10% to 20% of the total population during seasonal epidemics, resulting in between three and five million cases of severe illness and at least 250 000 to 500 000 deaths each year worldwide. Influenza vaccine is safe and effective, and while some influenza vaccinated people may still contract mild influenza, the vaccine does protect from the most dangerous consequence of the disease, pneumonia.\n\nWhile the human chain of SARS transmission has been interrupted, many experts are concerned that SARS might be a seasonal disease and return in the next few months, about a year after it first appeared in China.\n\nThe influenza vaccine does not prevent other respiratory diseases and, importantly, it does not provide protection from SARS. High vaccination coverage may reduce the number of pneumonia cases caused by influenza that might raise suspicions of SARS.\n\nSuspected SARS cases can result in considerable disruption of health services as well as costly precautionary measures and investigations. Also, decreasing the number of pneumonia cases, through influenza vaccination, can help in the early identification of a true SARS outbreak \u2013 should the disease recur. Early detection is essential to keep the disease contained.\n\nAs important as it is, influenza vaccine remains chronically under-used. An estimated one billion persons worldwide are at high risk of severe illness, but only 250 million are vaccinated each year, mainly in industrialized countries. Vaccination coverage of health workers is also low in most countries.",

            "Text": "5 July 2003 -- With Taiwan, China now off the list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS, the human-to-human chain of transmission of this new disease appears to be broken globally. The chain of transmission is considered broken at an outbreak site when 20 days have passed since the last probable case was placed in isolation, left the area, or died. If no further cases are detected during these 20 days, despite sensitive surveillance, the virus can be considered banished from its human host.\n\nIn late June, WHO announced that Hong Kong* and Beijing, the world\u2019s two most severely affected areas, had interrupted transmission. Toronto and Taiwan followed shortly afterwards, with Taiwan removed on 5 July.\n\nAt all outbreak sites around the world, the SARS virus has been pushed back out of its new human host. This is a striking achievement for an especially dangerous and poorly understood new disease, which was unheard of four months ago.\n\nHowever, the world must remain vigilant for SARS. The resurgence in late May of cases in Toronto, where the disease was thought to have been contained, is a sobering reminder of the resilience of SARS and its capacity to deliver surprises.\n\nThe earliest \u2013 and most mysterious \u2013 chains The earliest cases are now known to have occurred in mid-November in Guangdong Province, China. SARS was first carried out into the world at large on 21 February, when an infected medical doctor from Guangdong checked into room 911 on the 9th floor of the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong.\n\nThat single hotel floor became the setting, in ways that remain mysterious, for the international spread of SARS. At least 14 guests and visitors carried the virus with them to the hospital systems of Toronto, Hong Kong, Viet Nam, and Singapore. Most recently, an additional two guests from the UK, who subsequently fell ill and were hospitalized in the Philippines, were shown to have been infected with SARS when tested upon their return home. For reasons that remain unclear, these two patients were the only guests infected during their stay at the Hong Kong hotel who did not spark large outbreaks elsewhere.\n\nThe earliest and most severe outbreaks \u2013 in Toronto, Hong Kong, Viet Nam, and Singapore \u2013 were all seeded by visitors to the hotel. At that time, prior to the first global alert issued by WHO on 12 March, no one was aware that a severe new disease, capable of rapidly spreading in hospitals, had emerged. Hospital staff responding to the earliest cases failed to protect themselves from infection as they aggressively fought to save lives.\n\nAs a result, the disease rapidly spread within hospitals, infecting staff, other patients, and visitors, and then spilled out into the larger community as family members and their close contacts became infected. As the outbreaks grew in size, the number of exported cases rose, with 30 countries and areas eventually reporting cases.\n\nEffective detective work WHO and country health officials had to act rapidly. Tracking these chains of transmission became one of the key measures for controlling the outbreaks. In Singapore, for example, five patients were determined to account for 103 of the total 206 cases in the outbreak.\n\nOther measures to stem the outbreak included rapid detection and isolation of cases, quarantine of contacts, and travel restrictions. Case detection was further improved by the opening of hundreds of fever clinics and use of the mass media to encourage people to check for fever several times a day.\n\nFollowing the WHO global alert, and a stronger emergency travel advisory issued by WHO on 15 March, almost all countries experiencing imported cases have been able to either prevent any further transmission or keep the number of additional cases very small. This has been possible through heightened awareness of the symptoms to watch for and the actions to take.\n\nTaiwan, China, the sole exception, experienced an explosion of cases following a lapse in infection control procedures in a single hospital \u2013 yet another example of how unforgiving SARS can be.\n\nSARS is the first severe and easily transmissible new disease to emerge in the 21st century. Its containment, however, has been achieved through the diligent application of control measures from centuries past. In the final analysis, it will be these old-fashioned measures that defeat SARS \u2013 at least for now.\n\nRemaining questions\nThe most pressing question at present is whether SARS will return. Like the Ebola virus, whose origins have never been discovered, the SARS virus could hide in some animal or environmental reservoir, only to resurface once conditions again become ripe for spread to its new human host. SARS might also behave like many other respiratory diseases of viral origin, dying out as heat and humidity rise and returning when the season turns cooler. For this reason, WHO will be moving soon from an emergency-based response effort to a research agenda focused on answering this and many other critical questions. For example, it is possible that transmission could continue to occur, even after all known chains of transmission have been broken, at a level so low that it defies detection until the disease once again flares up in an outbreak.\n\nFor now, however, WHO\u2019s first objective of sealing off opportunities for further international spread appears close to becoming a reality.\n\n* Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China",

SARS is an infectious disease of unknown etiology characterized by atypical pneumonia (see WHO press release of 15 March and additional information at www.who.int.)\n\nThe disease is spread from person to person but only through close contact with a case. To date, almost all reported cases have occurred in health workers involved in the direct care of reported cases or in close contacts, such as family members. There is no evidence to date that the disease spreads though casual contact.\n\nThe WHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network is coordinating an international multicenter effort to identify the causative agent. The project unites 11 laboratories in 10 countries. Participating laboratories have the most experience to date in diagnosis of cases, or are known for their high-level facilities and expertise. The collaborative effort will also improve diagnostic precision and move work forward on the development of a diagnostic test. WHO is also working with health authorities to identify an effective treatment for SARS.\n\nWHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response teams in Hanoi and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China, where the most new cases are presently concentrated, are assisting health authorities in outbreak management and in the collection of epidemiological and clinical data that can improve understanding of SARS.\n\nThrough its regional office in Manila, Philippines, WHO is establishing logistics bases and supply chains to ensure rapid provision of protective equipment and medicines needed for outbreak response.\n\nChinese authorities have now issued a summary report on an outbreak of what may be the same or a related disease that began in Guangdong province in southern China in November and peaked in mid-February. The Chinese report, which includes data on the diagnosis and management of more than 300 cases, is presently undergoing analysis and is expected to further contribute to understanding about the syndrome and possible links among the various outbreaks. The Chinese report, which covers the largest number of cases to date, may also boost international efforts to establish effective treatment guidelines, should a relationship between the outbreaks be established.\n\nThe Ministry of Health of China has requested support from an international team. A WHO team is now being assembled.\n\nHealth authorities around the world are now alert to the risk of SARS. Tracking of the course of the epidemic shows that surveillance systems are sensitive, communication channels are open, and reporting is rapid. Information on cases compiled over the past three weeks is expected to shed new light on the behaviour of this disease.\n\nThe speed of international travel creates a risk of rapid spread to additional areas. Because the clinical course and epidemiological behaviour of this disease are poorly understood, WHO is calling upon national health authorities to maintain close vigilance for suspected cases.

            "Text": "Disease Outbreak Reported\n\nThe Singapore Ministry of Health has released the full report of an international investigation of a recent SARS case. The investigation, which followed laboratory confirmation on 8 September of SARS in a 27-year-old researcher, concluded that the patient most likely acquired the infection in a laboratory as the result of accidental contamination. The investigation found no evidence of further transmission and no reason to regard this single isolated case as a concern for international public health.\n\nThe case in Singapore marked the first case of SARS to be confirmed since the last known case in the world was detected and isolated in Taiwan, China, on 15 June. In addition to positive results in the laboratory tests for the SARS coronavirus, the SARS agent, subsequently confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Singapore patient showed clinical signs consistent with a diagnosis of SARS.\n\nThe patient was conducting research on the West Nile virus in a laboratory that was also conducting research using active SARS coronavirus. The investigation concluded that cross-contamination of West Nile virus samples with the SARS virus in the laboratory was the source of infection. Both viruses were detected in a research specimen.\n\nThe genetic sequence of the SARS coronavirus isolated from the infected patient was found to be closely related to the sequence of the laboratory strain, further supporting the likelihood that infection was the result of accidental laboratory contamination.\n\nThe investigation was conducted by an 11-member panel including experts from Singapore, WHO Western Pacific Regional Office and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The investigation found no evidence that the patient was a carrier of the SARS virus, acquired during some past contact with a SARS patient, or that any other chain of person-to-person transmission was the cause of the infection. Research on the SARS virus in Singapore is conducted in biosafety level 3 facilities.\n\nHowever, the experts identified several inappropriate laboratory practices that contributed to the accident, and made a series of recommendations for their correction. The laboratory where the accident occurred has been temporarily closed. The panel viewed the incident as an opportunity for Singapore to improve biosafety in its laboratories by introducing uniform standards of safety and improving the training of staff.\n\nBiosafety level 3 facilities are designed for work with Risk Group 3 microorganisms, as defined in the WHO Laboratory Biosafety Manual, Edition 2.5. Biosafety level 3 containment requires special engineering and design features as well as heightened safety standards and practices.\n\nThe possibility that a SARS outbreak could occur following a laboratory accident is a risk of considerable importance, given the relatively large number of laboratories currently conducting research using the SARS coronavirus or retaining specimens from SARS patients.\n\nThe investigation found that the case in Singapore was rapidly detected by surveillance procedures in place at Singapore General Hospital and appropriate clinical management and infection control practices were implemented. The swift detection of this case illustrates the importance of continued global vigilance for SARS. This is especially needed in areas that were affected by SARS, and in all institutions that have retained virus isolates and/or diagnostic specimens from SARS patients. It also highlights the importance of strict adherence to appropriate laboratory biosafety procedures and practices for work with communicable agents, such as the SARS coronavirus.",

The patient is a television producer who has been under treatment, in isolation, at a hospital in the provincial capital, Guangzhou, since 20 December.\n\nThis is the first confirmed case of SARS in 2004, and the first case not linked to a laboratory accident that has occurred since the initial outbreak of SARS was declared contained on 5 July 2003. Laboratory-related cases occurred after that date in Singapore in September and in Taiwan, China in December of last year.\n\nThe Guangdong case has been under investigation, with WHO support, since 26 December, when the suspected case was initially reported by Chinese authorities. Previous diagnostic tests produced inconclusive results. In view of the limitations of SARS diagnostic tests, confirmation of positive results by a WHO-designated reference laboratory is required for a definitive diagnosis of SARS.\n\nThe confirmatory tests were conducted in Hong Kong by both the University of Hong Kong at the Queen Mary Hospital and the Government Virus Unit of the Department of Health. Both laboratories are members of the WHO Multicentre Collaborative Network for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Diagnosis that collectively identified the SARS coronavirus in mid-April 2003, and have considerable diagnostic expertise.\n\nThe source of infection for this newly confirmed case remains unclear. Several lines of investigation last year suggest that SARS may have originated from contact with wild animals sold for human consumption at live markets in southern China. Studies conducted last year detected a SARS-like virus in some animal species, including the masked palm civet. Retrospective analysis of patient records has linked several of the earliest cases, which began occurring in Guangdong in mid-November 2002, to contact with wild animals. However, no animal reservoir of the SARS coronavirus has been conclusively identified to date.\n\nEpidemiological investigations in China have not yet been able to link the patient to exposure to wild animals or any other known or suspected source of the virus.\n\nChinese authorities have introduced several measures as investigation of the case has evolved. The patient has been treated in isolation since his hospitalization on 20 December, four days after the onset of symptoms. All contacts have been traced and followed up. All are reported to be free of symptoms and most have been released from quarantine, suggesting that no further transmission has occurred. Surveillance for additional cases has been intensified in Guangdong and other provinces.\n\nThe single isolated case does not constitute grounds for issuing a SARS alert or recommending any restrictions on travel or trade.\n\nAt the request of Chinese authorities, additional WHO teams are being sent this week to assist in research aimed at identifying the source of infection and preventing further cases.\n\nThe first cases of SARS occurred in Guangdong in mid-November 2002.

The speed at which this virus was identified is the result of the close international collaboration of 13 laboratories from 10 countries. While many lines of evidence have found strong associations between this virus and the disease over the last weeks, final confirmation came today.\n\n\u201cThe pace of SARS research has been astounding,\u201d said Dr. David Heymann, Executive Director, WHO Communicable Diseases programmes. \u201cBecause of an extraordinary collaboration among laboratories from countries around the world, we now know with certainty what causes SARS.\u201d\n\nThe successful identification of the coronavirus means that scientists can now confidently turn to other SARS challenges. For example, various laboratories continue to work to unravel the genetic information of the SARS virus and compare the sequences obtained from viruses in different parts of the world. Experts are gathering at WHO this week to map future work on SARS.\n\n\u201cToday, the collaboration continues as top laboratory researchers have come to WHO to design the next steps, a strategy for transforming these basic research discoveries into diagnostic tools which will help us to successfully control this disease,\u201d said Heymann. \u201cNow we can move away from methods like isolation and quarantines and move aggressively towards modern intervention strategies including specific treatments and eventually vaccination. With the establishment of the causative agent, we are a crucial step closer.\u201d\n\nThis collaboration has brought together leading scientific expertise, and was established after WHO issued a global alert on SARS on 12 March 2003. The priority has been to find the cause and to develop diagnostic tests. Two laboratories in China recently joined this network of laboratories from Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.\n\n\u201cToday, the first part of the mission of our network has been fulfilled, as researchers have both detected a hitherto unknown virus and established it as the cause of SARS. The new coronavirus has been named by WHO and member laboratories as \u201cSARS virus, \u201d said Dr Albert Osterhaus, the Director of Virology at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam. Erasmus completed the work to definitely prove that the new coronavirus causes SARS.\n\nOver the past three weeks, due to the urgency surrounding the worldwide threat to health of SARS and early indications this was a new member of the coronavirus family, research has proceeded under the assumption that SARS was caused by a new coronavirus.\n\nThe 13 laboratories have been working on meeting Koch\u2019s postulates, necessary to prove disease causation. These postulates stipulate that to be the causal agent, a pathogen must meet four conditions: it must be found in all cases of the disease, it must be isolated from the host and grown in pure culture, it must reproduce the original disease when introduced into a susceptible host, and it must be found in the experimental host so infected.\n\nCredit for the coronavirus findings, which definitively pinpoints the cause of SARS, is attributed to the 13 laboratories, working in conjunction with WHO.\n\n\u201cThe people in this network have put aside profit and prestige to work together to find the cause of this new disease and to find way new ways of fighting it,\u201d said Dr Klaus St\u00f6hr, WHO virologist and the coordinator of the collaborative research network. \u201cIn this globalized world, such collaboration is the only way forward in tackling emerging diseases.\u201d\n\nWHO and the network of laboratories dedicate their detection and characterization of the SARS virus to Dr Carlo Urbani, the WHO scientist who first alerted the world to the existence of SARS in Hanoi, Vietnam, and who died from the disease in Bangkok on 29 March 2003.",

This brings the total number of cases in China, reported since 22 April, to nine. Of these, one has died.\n\nThe new case, in Beijing, is a 49-year-old female retired doctor. On 12 April, she was admitted to the same hospital ward where a 20-year-old nurse was being treated for pneumonia. The former doctor began developing SARS-like symptoms on 19 April and on 22 April was transferred to Ditan Hospital and placed in isolation. Her condition is listed as critical.\n\nThe 20-year-old nurse, previously reported to WHO as a confirmed case, has been linked to an additional five cases. These include the one reported today and four reported on Sunday. To date, all cases have been linked to chains of transmission involving close contact with an identified case. The second confirmed case, who remains hospitalized in Anhui Province, is a 26-year-old postgraduate student who had been conducting research at the National Institute of Virology in Beijing. She is thought to be the index case in the present outbreak.\n\nDuring the 2003 outbreak, the transmission of SARS was greatly amplified in hospital settings. As a risk reduction strategy in Beijing, all seven SARS cases are now being treated in Ditan Hospital.\n\nHowever, patients were treated or assessed in open wards at seven hospitals (five in Beijing and 2 in Anhui) before suspicions of SARS were raised and procedures of isolation and infection control were introduced. In addition, the two patients in Anhui travelled long distances within China by train.\n\nAs these events created opportunities for multiple exposures, Chinese authorities have undertaken extensive tracing and follow-up of contacts. In Beijing, nearly 700 persons have been isolated or placed in quarantine.\n\nThe maximum incubation period for SARS is generally accepted to be 10 days. Based on present knowledge about the disease, persons exposed to the virus are not infectious prior to the onset of symptoms. For these reasons, rapid detection and isolation of cases, and rapid tracing and follow-up of contacts have been successfully used to bring a SARS outbreak under control.\n\nInvestigation of the outbreak\n\nFollowing a request by the Chinese Ministry of Health, the initial members of a WHO team are now in Beijing to assist in the investigation and control of the outbreaks there and in Anhui. Investigation of the source of infection will initially focus on biosafety procedures at the National Institute of Virology in Beijing. Two of the nine cases reported by China, including the earliest case, were researchers at the institute, which has been conducting work using the live SARS coronavirus.\n\nChinese authorities are providing WHO with detailed clinical and epidemiological information on all cases. This information is important in assessing the severity of illness caused by the virus and the extent of its transmission. Of the 8 patients currently hospitalized for treatment, the patient in Anhui Province continues to improve. In Beijing, two patients are in critical condition and the others remain under treatment for pneumonia.\n\nIf the source of infection is determined to come from the National Institute of Virology in Beijing, this will be the first SARS outbreak caused by a laboratory-acquired virus, which could possibly cause different patterns of illness and transmission. Previous laboratory-associated cases \u2013 a single case each in Singapore in September 2003 and in Taiwan, China in December 2003 \u2013 did not result in any further transmission. Both cases fully recovered.\n\nIn addition, four cases (3 confirmed and 1 probable) were reported in Guangdong Province in December 2003 and January 2004, presumably acquired from an environmental source. Unlike the present outbreak, these cases were associated with mild illness only and did not result in secondary transmission to others.",

Cases were reported to have occurred in 7 cities of Guangdong Province.\n\nChinese authorities had previously reported to WHO, on 14 February, a total of 305 cases and 5 deaths from 16 November to 9 February 2003.\n\nThe new figures cover the period of 16 November to 28 February.\n\nA WHO team of 5 international experts, which arrived in China on the weekend, has today reviewed the case definition used in reporting cases of atypical pneumonia in Guangdong Province. The WHO team compared this definition with the WHO definition used to identify probable cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and concluded that the two definitions are compatible.\n\nFollowing in-depth discussion with central-level authorities and health officials in Guangdong Province on the details of several clusters of cases, the WHO expert team reached the conclusion that the atypical pneumonia cases which began occurring in southern China in November 2002 are likely cases of the same disease, now referred to as SARS, that began appearing in other Asian countries on 26 February and has since spread widely to several cities throughout the world.\n\nChinese authorities further informed the WHO team of a new reporting system that will rely on regular provincial updates. WHO is expecting further information on reported cases in China for March as these data become available.\n\nCase management guidelines being used in China are in line with WHO recommendations for minimizing further transmission.\n\nChina is also beginning a collaborative programme in which sera from infected Chinese patients will be exchanged with the WHO network of collaborating laboratories who are working to identify the SARS causative agent.\n\nUpdate on reported cases\nThe new data from China bring the total number of reported probable cases worldwide, dating back to 16 November, to 1323 cases and 49 deaths. When the data from China are excluded, today\u2019s figures represent an increase of 41 cases, largely concentrated in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, and one death, in Singapore, compared with yesterday. Full details are available on the WHO web site.Cumulative Number of Reported Cases (SARS).\n\nNational measures to contain further spread\nSeveral countries are introducing maximum measures, including quarantine, to prevent the further spread of SARS.\n\nNew diseases such as SARS are poorly understood as they emerge. At the beginning of an outbreak, it is sound public health policy to institute maximum control measures needed to prevent further spread.\n\nMaximum measures are justified when, in the view of national health authorities, they can be expected to protect populations against infection, keep the disease from spreading into the general population, and help prevent international spread to other countries, particularly through air travel.\n\nAs the epidemiology of SARS becomes more fully understood, such measures can be adjusted and reduced in line with what is known about how the disease is transmitted and what works best to stop its spread, both nationally and internationally.\n\nFirst clinical \u201cgrand rounds\u201d on SARS held today\nThe first global \u201cgrand rounds\u201d on SARS clinical features and treatment were held today by WHO. The electronic meeting united 80 clinicians from 13 countries. A summary of their discussions and conclusions has been posted today at the WHO web site.Clinicians hold virtual conference on management of SARS patients.\n\nProgress towards identification of the virus\nResearch attention is increasingly focusing on the Coronavirus family, though viruses from the Paramyxovirus and other families are also being considered as scientists cast the widest possible net in their search for the cause of SARS. Many are of the opinion that a diagnostic test could rapidly follow conclusive identification of the pathogen. Experts in the network are also considering the theory that SARS is caused by co-infection with two new viruses that somehow need each other in order to cause severe disease in humans. Evidence is strongly pointing to a new virus, or possibly two new viruses, that have not previously been known to infect humans or cause severe disease.\n\nHypotheses include a virus known to cause disease in an animal host that has jumped the species barrier to infect humans, or a known human virus that has mutated to acquire properties that are causing much more severe disease in humans. It is increasingly certain, however, that SARS is a serious new disease caused by a newly recognized pathogen.",

            "HeadLine": "Operational Considerations for the Identification of Healthcare Workers and Inpatients with Suspected COVID-19 in non-US Healthcare Settings",
            "Text": "1. Overview\nThis document provides guidance on the identification or screening of healthcare workers (HCWs)[1] and inpatients with suspected COVID-19. Rational, requirements, and considerations will be discussed for three broad case identification strategies:\n\nPassive strategies: Reporting/alerts are initiated by the data source (e.g., healthcare worker or treating clinician) based on a known set of rules or regulations.\nEnhanced passive strategies: Reporting/alerts are initiated by the data source with an added mechanism to prompt data collection, review, and/or reporting.\nActive strategies: Reporting/alerts are initiated by the centralized health authority (e.g., Ministry of Health, facility infection preventionist, facility administration) using a known set of rules or regulations.\nTo support the activities for these strategies, this document provides an initial discussion on the importance of defining the signs/symptoms of persons with COVID-19, general best practices, and surveillance capacities.\n\n 2. Signs and Symptoms Consistent with COVID-19\nUncertainty remains in defining a generalizable set of characteristic signs and symptoms for COVID-19. At best, current evidence suggests substantial variability ranging from mild to severe and based on only partially described patient-level factors. The most commonly reported signs and symptoms in the current literature include:\n\nFever\nCough\nShortness of breath\nHowever, additional non-specific or atypical symptoms include:\n\nSore throat\nDiarrhea\nMyalgia (muscle aches, body aches)\nTiredness or fatigue\nFurther, elderly patients may present differently than younger populations.\n\nGiven these limitations, facilities should define a standardized set of signs and symptoms (e.g., fever and/or cough/shortness of breath) to screen HCWs and patients for suspected COVID-19. A high level of suspicion is critical to ensure cases do not go unrecognized due to likely substantial proportion of patients and healthcare workers presenting with atypical or minimal symptoms.\n\n3. General Best Practices\nIn addition to a specific strategy for the identification of suspected COVID-19 cases, there are general best practices that will improve both healthcare worker and inpatient COVID-19 screening. Some examples include:\n\nTrain and Educate Healthcare Workers\n\nProvide healthcare workers with job- or task-specific education and training on identifying and preventing transmission of infectious agents, including refresher training\nEnsure that healthcare workers are educated, trained, and have practiced the appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) prior to caring for a patient\nProvide job-aids and up-to-date reference materials\nEncourage and support a high index of suspicion in healthcare workers regarding suspect COVID-19 cases\nMonitor and Manage Ill and Exposed Healthcare Workers\n\nFacilities and organizations providing healthcare should implement sick leave policies for healthcare workers that are non-punitive, flexible, and consistent with public health guidance\nMovement and monitoring decisions for healthcare workers with exposure to COVID-19 should be made in consultation with public health authorities\nEstablish Reporting within and between Healthcare Facilities and to Public Health Authorities\n\nImplement mechanisms and policies that promote situational awareness for facility staff about confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients and facility plans for response, including:\nInfection control\nHealthcare epidemiology\nFacility leadership\nOccupational health\nClinical laboratory\nFrontline staff\nCommunicate and collaborate with public health authorities\nCommunicate information about confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients to appropriate personnel before transferring to other departments in the facility and to other healthcare facilities\n4. Surveillance Capacities\nFacility-based surveillance for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), including infections in healthcare workers and inpatients, is one of the WHO\u2019s eight core components of infection prevention and control.  While surveillance is a critical component of providing safe healthcare, it is important to recognize that it requires expertise, good quality data, and an established infection prevention and control (IPC) program and thus, may require time to set up[2].  For this reason, during public health emergency response, healthcare facilities are encouraged to initially implement facility-based suspect COVID-19 patient case finding (surveillance) feasible with existing surveillance capacities.\n\nHealth facility surveillance capacity varies greatly even within health systems.  A realistic appraisal of capacity can help identify the best strategy for a given context.  A general description of surveillance capacities based on existing HAI surveillance activity is provided for guidance.\n\nSurveillance Capacities\nSurveillance Capacity\tStandardized HAI case definitions / methods\tDedicated surveillance staff3\tPatient-level data available / accessible\nHigh: Resources needed for detailed patient interviews and/or chart reviews are readily available\tYES\tYES\tYES\nMedium: Some experience with standardized data collection with limitation in staff and data availability\tYES\tPARTIAL\tPARTIAL\nLow to Very Low: Little to no experience with patient-level collection of standardized data, limited availability of staff and data for reassignment for case finding activities\tPARTIAL\tNO\tNO\n5. Identification of Healthcare workers with suspected COVID-19\nObjective:  Prevent exposure of at-risk patients and staff to symptomatic COVID-19 positive healthcare workers. Passive strategy\nAll healthcare workers self-assess for fever and/or a defined set of newly present symptoms indicative of COVID-19.  If fever or respiratory symptoms are present, healthcare workers:\n\nRemotely report this information4\nDo not report to their health facility\nAre provided with immediate medical assessment and follow-up actions\nRationale:\nEstablishes mechanisms for the identification of healthcare workers at increased likelihood of infection with minimal resource requirements.\n\nRequirements:\nList of symptoms and thermometer for self-assessment.\nStaff and mechanism (e.g., telephone line) for remote reporting of fever and/or presence of symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Ideally this system is always available for quick medical assessment.5\nDecision algorithms for response to healthcare worker reports and the results of secondary assessment.\nStandardized medical assessment and movement and monitoring forms.\nConsiderations:\nAdherence is highly dependent on healthcare worker motivation and appropriate self-assessment of risk.\nCan result in reduction in work force, particularly among some critical staffing categories.\nProvision of paid sick leave/compensation for all healthcare workers not allowed to work is often critical for success, requiring substantial resources. Enhanced passive strategy\nIn addition to passive strategy, establish a plan to remind or prompt workers to self-assess for symptoms consistent with COVID-19.  Common reminders include automated text messages or phone calls.\n\nRationale:\nEvidence suggests that simple automatic reminders can increase adherence.\n\nRequirements:\nAll requirements of Passive Strategy\nAutomated (e.g., mass texting service) or manual system (e.g., direct messaging or phone calls) to contact healthcare workers as prompt for self-assessment\nRequirements (Automated System):\nMass Text Messaging Services capable of sending SMS (short message service) messages to groups of people simultaneously. Mass Text Messaging Services are sometimes provided by independent internet-based service companies or, in some settings, are provided by cellular service providers.\nDatabase of contacts (i.e., healthcare workers under monitoring). In addition to contact number, database fields may include name, position, work unit/area, and monitoring end date.\nAn effective and informative mass text message including frequency of messaging, timing of delivery, and any interactivity of interventions6.\nRequirements (Manual System):\nDatabase of contacts (i.e., healthcare workers under monitoring). Because of the effort required in manual systems, this database should be carefully targeted to minimize workload and maximize benefit.  Considerations for targeting might include:\nHealthcare workers with documented COVID-19 exposure\nHealthcare workers serving a population at high-risk of COVID-19 complication\nStaff available to contact monitored healthcare workers with reminders.\nPhone and phone credit to support messaging and or calls.\nConsiderations:\nSame as Passive Strategy\nFunding may be required to support bulk text messaging Active strategies\nIn-person active strategy\nAll healthcare workers present for in-person evaluation of symptoms and fever prior to each shift.  If symptoms consistent of COVID-19 are reported or observed, healthcare workers are provided with immediate follow-up actions.\n\nRemote active strategy\nAll healthcare workers report (e.g., by call or text) the absence or presence of symptoms consistent with COVID-19 remotely each day.  Staff that fail to report or report symptoms are followed up.\n\nRationale:\nWhile there is limited evidence for the benefit of active healthcare worker monitoring, active strategies will theoretically result in increased healthcare worker adherence to self-evaluation of symptoms, thus enhancing patient protection.\n\nRequirements (In-person active strategy):\nAll requirements of Passive Strategy\nDedicated staff to evaluate healthcare workers before their shift (active) or respond and monitor healthcare worker reports\nPhysical area for staff evaluations that will allow recommended social distancing (i.e., at least two meters) and includes adequate hand hygiene stations (soap and running water or alcohol-based hand rub)\nNo touch thermometers\nImplementation plan that includes a method to ensure that staff present at a given place for pre-shift evaluation\nAccountability system to ensure all healthcare workers have been evaluated (e.g., work slip sign off)\nRequirements (Remote Active Strategy):\nAll requirements of Passive Strategy\nAccountability system to ensure all healthcare workers report in remotely prior to their work shift\nConsiderations:\nSame as Passive Strategy.\nActive monitoring of healthcare workers can be highly resource intensive. There is limited evidence of increased effectiveness in prevention of nosocomial transmission beyond passive strategies.\nAcceptance by staff can be limited by perceptions of mistrust in ability to monitor and appropriately report symptoms.\nActive monitoring can decrease the likelihood that healthcare workers self-monitor signs and symptoms. Ideally, healthcare workers are checking their own temperature and symptoms and will not present if not indicated. Any action that weakens self-monitoring should be implemented with caution.\nTo decrease workload, and if accountability can be maintained, the following can be delegated to unit/immediate supervisors (e.g., head/charge nurses, department heads):\nresponsibility for receiving symptom/temperature reports\nmonitoring staff compliance for the remote active strategy\n6. Identification of Inpatients with suspected COVID-19\nThe development of acute respiratory infection and healthcare-associated pneumonia are common complications of hospitalization. However, it is important that clinicians maintain a high level of suspicion for COVID-19 when there is a compatible presentation.  Because healthcare facilities often represent a gathering of individuals at higher risk of infection and adverse outcome, the potential of outbreak and harm to patients requires special effort to ensure any inpatient COVID-19 cases are identified.\n\nA goal of identifying inpatients with suspected COVID-19 is to guide infection prevention and control (IPC) strategies to prevent or limit transmission in healthcare setting.  See interim WHO guidance hereexternal icon7. Passive Strategy:\nClinicians are kept informed8 on:\n\nCurrent COVID-19 case definitions\nLatest description of COVID-19 clinical presentation\nRelevant local epidemiology, including at risk groups and association with travel or area of residence\nFacility COVID-19 admission triage, and cohorting practices\nClinicians are also made aware of what to do if they suspect COVID-19 in a hospitalized patient, including isolation precautions, PPE use, reporting/informing IPC focal point at the facility and public health authorities, and how to obtain testing, if available\n\nRecommended Surveillance Capacity Level:\nApplicable at all HAI surveillance capacity levels (i.e., Very Low to High)\n\nRationale:\nMinimal disruption of existing clinical practice and no requirement for standardized data collection or form completion. Strategy seeks to encourage recognition and reporting by astute clinicians.\n\nRequirements:\nRegular and up-to-date educational materials/job aids provided to and accessible by clinicians\nCOVID-19 case definitions9\nStandard operating procedure (SOP) for response to identified suspect case patients (e.g., isolation, cohorting, PPE). See WHO interim guidance (hereexternal icon) for recommendations\nAcceptable reporting/communication channels to hospital administration and public health authorities\nConsiderations:\nStrategy is dependent on participation and skill of available clinicians and an understanding of local epidemiology and clinical presentation of COVID-19, which may differ in different populations.\nLimited to no access for viral testing will complicate this effort with the most conservative strategy being to treat all suspect cases as confirmed cases (empirical case determination) \u2013 potentially wasting resources, and if cases are cohorted, mixing positive and negative patients for extended periods.\nThe degree of resource waste and case patient mixing will depend on the accuracy of empirical case determination.\nSupporting empirical case determination through clinician education and job aids (as described) can help improve accuracy of clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Enhanced Passive Strategy:\nEnhancement of the passive strategy can be achieved through establishing systems that prompt or require clinicians to regularly review all patients as to their likelihood of harboring COVID-19.  Example enhanced passive strategies might include:\n\nIncorporating consideration of COVID-19 into sign out reporting\nRequiring units to provide a daily clinician-generated list of suspected cases, including if there are zero cases\nSpecific daily request to clinicians to report and discuss encountered patients with symptoms/history consistent with COVID-19\nRecommended Surveillance Capacity Level:\nApplicable in most HAI surveillance capacity levels (very low to high)\n\nRationale:\nDialog and accountability for case finding and reporting can improve empirical case determination, ensure patient evaluations are not missed, and help avoid clinician complacency over the long term\n\nRequirements:\nAll requirements of Passive Strategy\nStrategy to prompt and/or ensure clinician review \u2013 Requirements will depend on selected strategy\nConsiderations:\nEffective strategies will be context specific \u2013 requiring thought and effort in design and implementation\nMay represent changes in current practice limiting acceptability Active Strategy:\nActive case identification involves targeted data collection and review of patient information by groups specifically responsible for the identification of suspected COVID-19 cases.  Examples of groups responsible for case identification and active case identification may include:\n\nMinistries of Health\nSub-national/local public health authorities\nFacility infection prevention and control teams\nRecommended Surveillance Capacity Level:\nHigh existing surveillance capacity or medium capacity with the provision of additional resources\n\nRationale:\nSmaller more centralized team responsible for case identification can increase overall quality through dedicated training, improved engagement, limiting of competing priorities, and standardization of methods\n\nRequirements:\nTeam with the information access, resources, and experience necessary for systematic review of patient information in order to appropriately apply standardized suspect case definitions\nGroup(s) with availability and responsibility for data collection, analysis/presentation, and information sharing\nGroup(s) with availability and responsibility for review of case-finding information with the authority and willingness to take appropriate action\nConsiderations:\nHighly resource intensive\nTeams with the requisite skills can be difficult to build during outbreak response periods\nSeparates case finding activities from patient care activities, which can decrease acceptability and impact sustainability\nValue of active inpatient case finding, especially the context of limited viral testing, should be carefully considered\n7.

            "HeadLine": "Operational Considerations for Maintaining Essential Services for and Providing Maternal, Newborn, and Child Healthcare in Low-Resource Countries",
            "Text": "While current data suggest that pregnant women, newborns, and children are not at highest risk for COVID-19 deaths, disruption of routine essential services poses a threat to their survival and health.\n\nBased on what we know at this time, pregnant women might be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant women. The risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth, is increased among pregnant women with chronic conditions, such as asthma, heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes, or infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and HIV, and may be increased among pregnant women with COVID-19. Newborns with low birth weight or prematurity are at increased risk for complications both generally and as a result of COVID-19. Among children, malnutrition, chronic conditions (e.g., asthma, diabetes, congenital heart defects, epilepsy, and behavior/learning problems), TB, malaria, and HIV are all examples of issues that need consistent healthcare services; service disruptions as a result of COVID-19 could result in substantial increases in mortality as a result of non-COVID-19 conditions, similar to what was seen during the Ebola epidemic. [1, 2]\n\nTherefore, it is crucial that the needs of mothers, newborns, and children are kept in mind when developing mitigation strategies for maintaining essential services delivery in low-resource countries, including considering providing services by telehealth where feasible. In addition, it is essential that clinics use mitigation strategies, including:\n\nImplementing infection prevention and control activities (IPC).\nEnsuring staff use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as masks and eye protection (e.g., goggles, face shield) for all patients and gowns and gloves as needed.\nEnsuring patients wear cloth face coverings for source control.\nEnforcing a distance of at least 2 meters between all people in the facility (social distancing) whenever possible.\nMaking handwashing stations with soap and water or hand sanitizer soap with at least 60% alcohol available.\nThe following considerations should supplement local Ministry of Health Guidance.\n\nEssential Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (MNCH) services to Provide During COVID-19 Individualize counseling and advice on self-care, in addition to COVID-19-specific messages.\nEssential and emergency maternal care interventions\n\nScreen for and manage anemia, malaria, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, sexually transmitted infections/HIV, TB, gender-based violence, infection, antepartum/postpartum hemorrhage, labor, and childbirth complications.\nProvide preventive measures per country guidelines.\nEnsure availability of auxiliary services: ultrasound, laboratory services, and blood bank services. Essential and emergency newborn care interventions\n\nScreen for and manage asphyxia, congenital anomalies, birth injuries, infection, feeding problems, breathing difficulties, hypo-/hyperthermia.\nProvide prophylactic treatment as indicated: antibiotics, antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, TB drugs.\nProvide essential care: birth dose of oral polio vaccine, bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), and hepatitis B vaccinations per national immunization schedule; thermal protection, eye and cord care, vitamin K.\nRespond to observed signs or reported problems.\nFacilitate early and exclusive breastfeeding.\nProvide individualized counseling messages for parents/caregivers. Essential child health services\n\nPrioritize primary series vaccinations, especially for measles-rubella- or poliomyelitis-containing vaccines and other combination vaccines.\nPrioritize vaccination for diseases with risk of outbreaks: measles, polio, diphtheria, and yellow fever.\nPrioritize pneumococcal and seasonal influenza vaccines for vulnerable population groups.\nProvide diagnostic testing for infants and children exposed to HIV (or other diseases) per national algorithms/guidelines\nIntensify effort to detect and monitor the nutritional status using low-literacy/numeracy tools including Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) tapes\nSpecial considerations\n\nAdolescent girls and youth may be particularly impacted by changes to service delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as sexual exploitation and abuse, gender-based violence, less access to education, adolescent pregnancies, and unequal access to information. Adolescents who are pregnant or young parents may be disproportionately impacted by social isolation and lack of social support.\nWhile the technical components of service delivery may remain the same, health care providers may need to alter modes of delivery to meet patient needs. Women represent 70% of the health and social sector workforce globally,1 and with their frontline interaction with communities and participation in care work, they face a higher risk of exposure to COVID-19; appropriate engineering and administrative controls and PPE should be used to minimize risk of infection to all frontline workers. Further, special attention should be given to how their work environment may expose them to discrimination and to address their social and reproductive health and psychosocial needs as frontline health workers.\n1 https://www.who.int/health-topics/health-workforce#tab=tab_1external icon\n\nOptimize service delivery in Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health settings and platforms\n\nAntenatal Care\n\nLabor and Childbirth\n\nPostnatal Care and Essential Newborn Care\n\nTelehealth\n\nTriage and provide advice on common discomforts, concerns or preoccupations, and danger signs related to pregnancy (e.g., haemorrhage, swelling, headache, blurry vision).\nProvide counseling on family planning, pregnancy spacing, birth preparedness/ complication readiness plan, and visit schedule.\nMental and emotional health support (e.g., for prenatal depression)\nAdherence support for women with chronic illnesses (for example, HIV)\nAdvice on self-care.2\nCommunity-based visits with a trained community health worker (CHW) using point-of-care devices:\n\nVisits at 20, 26, 34, and 38 weeks\nAdvice on common discomforts\nVoluntary counseling and testing for HIV\nCounseling and referral as needed for syphilis, hepatitis B\nUrinalysis with urine dipsticks for proteinuria and asymptomatic bacteriuria, rapid test for malaria\nFollow-up of problems/infections/illnesses being managed by a skilled provider\nDistribution of iron-folic acid, mebendazole, PrEP, ARV, intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp)\nTreatment of malaria\nTriage and referral for identified problems\nGroup antenatal care sessions should be discontinued or transitioned to telehealth if possible (i.e. WhatsApp)\nFacility-based visits with a skilled provider and laboratory capacity\n\nFirst visit at any gestational age, to include ultrasound estimation of gestational age\nVisits at 30, 36, and 40 weeks\nVoluntary counseling and testing for HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B; treatment and management of people testing positive\nHemoglobin, urinalysis with urine dipsticks, rapid test for malaria\nDistribution of iron-folic acid, mebendazole, ARV drugs, IPTp; consider provision of multi- month prescriptions as applicable\nTreatment of malaria, urinary tract infection/asymptomatic bacteriuria\nEvaluation and management of danger signs\nInpatient or outpatient management of complications\nGroup antenatal care sessions should be discontinued or transitioned to telehealth if possible\nTelehealth\n\nTriage and advice for women who think they are in labor\nCommunity-based providers\n\nTriage and advice for women who think they are in labor\nFacility-based delivery with a skilled provider (private or public sector)\n\nCesarean surgeries should only be performed when medically indicated.

We do not know whether mothers with COVID-19 can transmit the virus via breast milk, but the limited dataexternal icon available suggest this is not likely. A mother\u2019s intention to breastfeed should be supported by maternity care providers. A mother with confirmed COVID-19 should be counseled to take precautions to avoid spreading the virus to her infant, including handwashing and wearing a cloth face covering. If a woman is COVID-19 positive and too unwell to breastfeed, provide support for the woman to express breastmilk. If possible, expressed breast milk should be fed to the infant by a healthy caregiver, who is not at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 (also see hereexternal icon). An infant being breastfed by a mother who is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 should be considered as having suspected COVID-19\u2014when the infant\u2019s testing results are not available\u2014for the duration of the mother\u2019s recommended period of home isolation and 14 days thereafter.\n4 All newborns need to be given skin-to-skin care by the mother, irrespective of the mother\u2019s or their COVID-19 infection status, as recommended by WHOexternal icon.

            "HeadLine": "Interim Operational Considerations for Implementing the Shielding Approach to Prevent COVID-19 Infections in Humanitarian Settings",
            "Text": "This document presents considerations from the perspective of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) for implementing the shielding approach in humanitarian settings as outlined in guidance documents focused on camps, displaced populations and low-resource settings.1,2  This approach has never been documented and has raised questions and concerns among humanitarian partners who support response activities in these settings. The purpose of this document is to highlight potential implementation challenges of the shielding approach from CDC\u2019s perspective and guide thinking around implementation in the absence of empirical data. Considerations are based on current evidence known about the transmission and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and may need to be revised as more information becomes available. Please check the CDC website periodically for updates.\n\nWhat is the Shielding Approach1?\nThe shielding approach aims to reduce the number of severe COVID-19 cases by limiting contact between individuals at higher risk of developing severe disease (\u201chigh-risk\u201d) and the general population (\u201clow-risk\u201d). High-risk individuals would be temporarily relocated to safe or \u201cgreen zones\u201d established at the household, neighborhood, camp/sector or community level depending on the context and setting.1,2 They would have minimal contact with family members and other low-risk residents.\n\nCurrent evidence indicates that older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.3 In most humanitarian settings, older population groups make up a small percentage of the total population.4,5  For this reason, the shielding approach suggests physically separating high-risk individuals from the general population to prioritize the use of the limited available resources and avoid implementing long-term containment measures among the general population.\n\nIn theory, shielding may serve its objective to protect high-risk populations from disease and death. However, implementation of the approach necessitates strict adherence1,6,7, to protocol. Inadvertent introduction of the virus into a green zone may result in rapid transmission among the most vulnerable populations the approach is trying to protect.\n\nA summary of the shielding approach described by Favas is shown in Table 1. See Guidance for the prevention of COVID-19 infections among high-risk individuals in low-resource, displaced and camp and camp-like settings 1,2 for full details.\n\nTable 1: Summary of the Shielding Approach1\n\nLevel\n\nMovement/ Interactions\n\nHousehold (HH) Level:\n\nA specific room/area designated for high-risk individuals who are physically isolated from other HH members.\n\nLow-risk HH members should not enter the green zone. If entry is necessary, it should be done only by healthy individuals after washing hands and using face coverings. Interactions should be at a safe distance (approx. 2 meters). Minimum movement of high-risk individuals outside the green zone. Low-risk HH members continue to follow social distancing and hygiene practices outside the house.\n\nNeighborhood Level:\n\nA designated shelter/group of shelters (max 5-10 households), within a small camp or area where high-risk members are grouped together. Neighbors \u201cswap\u201d households to accommodate high-risk individuals.\n\nSame as above\n\nCamp/Sector Level:\n\nA group of shelters such as schools, community buildings within a camp/sector (max 50 high-risk individuals per single green zone) where high-risk individuals are physically isolated together.\n\nOne entry point is used for exchange of food, supplies, etc. A meeting area is used for residents and visitors to interact while practicing physical distancing (2 meters). No movement into or outside the green zone.\n\nOperational Considerations\nThe shielding approach requires several prerequisites for effective implementation. Several are addressed, including access to healthcare and provision of food. However, there are several prerequisites which require additional considerations. Table 2 presents the prerequisites or suggestions as stated in the shielding guidance document (column 1) and CDC presents additional questions and considerations alongside these prerequisites (column 2).\n\nTable 2: Suggested Prerequisites per the shielding documents and CDC\u2019s Operational Considerations for Implementation\n\nSuggested Prerequisites\n\n*As stated in the shielding document*\n\nConsiderations as suggested by CDC\n\nEach green zone has a dedicated latrine/bathing facility for high-risk individuals\nThe shielding approach advises against any new facility construction to establish green zones; however, few settings will have existing shelters or communal facilities with designated latrines/bathing facilities to accommodate high-risk individuals. In these settings, most latrines used by HHs are located outside the home and often shared by multiple HHs.\nIf dedicated facilities are available, ensure safety measures such as proper lighting, handwashing/hygiene infrastructure, maintenance and disinfection of latrines.\nEnsure facilities can accommodate high-risk individuals with disabilities, children and separate genders at the neighborhood/camp-level.\nTo minimize external contact, each green zone should include able-bodied high-risk individuals capable of caring for residents who have disabilities or are less mobile.  Otherwise, designate low-risk individuals for these tasks, preferably who have recovered from confirmed COVID-19 and are assumed to be immune.\nThis may be difficult to sustain, especially if the caregivers are also high risk. As caregivers may often will be family members, ensure that this strategy is socially or culturally acceptable.\nCurrently, we do not know if prior infection confers immunity.\nThe green zone and living areas for high-risk residents should be aligned with minimum humanitarian (SPHERE) standards.6\nThe shielding approach requires strict adherence to infection, prevention and control (IPC) measures. They require, uninterrupted availability of soap, water, hygiene/cleaning supplies, masks or cloth face coverings, etc. for all individuals in green zones. Thus, it is necessary to ensure minimum public health standards6 are maintained and possibly supplemented to decrease the risk of other outbreaks outside of COVID-19. Attaining and maintaining minimum SPHERE6 standards is difficult in these settings for the general population.8,9,10 Users should consider that provision of services and supplies to high risk individuals could be at the expense of low-risk residents, putting them at increased risk for other outbreaks.\nMonitor and evaluate the implementation of the shielding approach.\nMonitoring protocols will need to be developed for each type of green zone.\nDedicated staff need to be identified to monitor each green zone. Monitoring includes both adherence to protocols and potential adverse effects or outcomes due to isolation and stigma. It may be necessary to assign someone within the green zone, if feasible, to minimize movement in/out of green zones.\nMen and women, and individuals with tuberculosis (TB), severe immunodeficiencies, or dementia should be isolated separately\nMultiple green zones would be needed to achieve this level of separation, each requiring additional inputs/resources. Further considerations include challenges of accommodating different ethnicities, socio-cultural groups, or religions within one setting.\nCommunity acceptance and involvement in the design and implementation\nEven with community involvement, there may be a risk of stigmatization.11,12 Isolation/separation from family members, loss of freedom and personal interactions may require additional psychosocial support structures/systems. See section on additional considerations below.\nHigh-risk minors should be accompanied into isolation by a single caregiver who will also be considered a green zone resident in terms of movements and contacts with those outside the green zone.\nProtection measures are critical to implementation. Ensure there is appropriate, adequate, and acceptable care of other minors or individuals with disabilities or mental health conditions who remain in the HH if separated from their primary caregiver.\nGreen zone shelters should always be kept clean. Residents should be provided with the necessary cleaning products and materials to clean their living spaces.\nHigh-risk individuals will be responsible for cleaning and maintaining their own living space and facilities. This may not be feasible for persons with disabilities or decreased mobility.11 Maintaining hygiene conditions in communal facilities is difficult during non-outbreak settings.7,8,9 consequently it may be necessary to provide additional human resource support.\nGreen zones should be more spacious in terms of shelter area per capita than the surrounding camp/sector, even at the cost of greater crowding of low-risk people.\nEnsure that targeting high-risk individuals does not negate mitigation measures among low-risk individuals (physical distancing in markets or water points, where feasible, etc.). Differences in space based on risk status may increase the potential risk of exposure among the rest of the low-risk residents and may be unacceptable or impracticable, considering space limitations and overcrowding in many settings.\nAdditional Considerations\nThe shielding approach outlines the general \u201clogistics\u201d of implementation \u2013who, what, where, how. However, there may be additional logistical challenges to implementing these strategies as a result of unavailable commodities, transport restrictions, limited staff capacity and availability to meet the increased needs. The approach does not address the potential emotional, social/cultural, psychological impact for separated individuals nor for the households with separated members. Additional considerations to address these challenges are presented below.\n\nPopulation characteristics and demographics\nConsideration: The number of green zones required may be greater than anticipated, as they are based on the total number of high-risk individuals, disease categories, and the socio-demographics of the area and not just the proportion of elderly population.\n\nExplanation: Older adults represent a small percentage of the population in many camps in humanitarian settings (approximately 3-5%4,5), however in some humanitarian settings more than one quarter of the population may fall under high risk categories13,14,15 based on underlying medical conditions which may increase a person\u2019s risk for severe COVID-19 illness which include chronic kidney disease, obesity, serious heart conditions, sickle cell disease, and type 2 diabetes. Additionally, many camps and settlements host multiple nationalities which may require additional separation, for example, Kakuma Refugee Camp in Kenya accommodates refugees from 19 countries.16\n\nTimeline considerations\nConsideration: Plan for an extended duration of implementation time, at least 6 months.\n\nExplanation: The shielding approach proposes that green zones be maintained until one of the following circumstances arises: (i) sufficient hospitalization capacity is established; (ii) effective vaccine or therapeutic options become widely available; or (iii) the COVID-19 epidemic affecting the population subsides.\n\nGiven the limited resources and healthcare available to populations in humanitarian settings prior to the pandemic, it is unlikely sufficient hospitalization capacity (beds, personal protective equipment, ventilators, and staff) will be achievable during widespread transmission. The national capacity in many of the countries where these settings are located (e.g., Chad, Myanmar, and Syria) is limited. Resources may become quickly overwhelmed during the peak of transmission and may not be accessible to the emergency affected populations.\n\nVaccine trials are underway, but with no definite timeline. Reaching the suppression phase where the epidemic subsides can take several months and cases may resurge in a second or even third wave. Herd immunity (the depletion of susceptible people) for COVID-19 has not been demonstrated to date. It is also unclear if an infected person develops immunity and the duration of potential immunity is unknown. Thus, contingency plans to account for a possibly extended operational timeline are critical.\n\nOther logistical considerations\nConsideration: Plan to identify additional resources and outline supply chain mechanisms to support green zones.\n\nExplanation: The implementation and operation of green zones requires strong coordination among several sectors which may require substantial additional resources:  supplies and staff to maintain these spaces \u2013 shelters, IPC, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), non-food items (NFIs) (beds, linens, dishes/utensils, water containers), psychosocial support, monitors/supervisors, caretakers/attendants, risk communication and community engagement, security, etc. Considering global reductions in commodity shortages,17 movement restrictions, border closures, and decreased trucking and flights, it is important to outline what additional resources will be needed and how they will be procured.\n\nProtection\nConsideration: Ensure safe and protective environments for all individuals, including minors and individuals who require additional care whether they are in the green zone or remain in a household after the primary caregiver or income provider has moved to the green zone.\n\nExplanation: Separating families and disrupting and deconstructing multigenerational households may have long-term negative consequences. Shielding strategies need to consider sociocultural gender norms in order to adequately assess and address risks to individuals, particularly women and girls. 18,19,20 Restrictive gender norms may be exacerbated by isolation strategies such as shielding. At the household level, isolating individuals and limiting their interaction, compounded with social and economic disruption has raised concerns of potential increased risk of partner violence. Households participating in house swaps or sector-wide cohorting are at particular risk for gender-based violence, harassment, abuse, and exploitation as remaining household members may not be decision-makers or responsible for households needs.18,19,20\n\nSocial/Cultural/Religious Practices\nConsideration: Plan for potential disruption of social networks.\n\nExplanation: Community celebrations (religious holidays), bereavement (funerals) and other rites of passage are cornerstones of many societies. Proactive planning ahead of time, including strong community engagement and risk communication is needed to better understand the issues and concerns of restricting individuals from participating in communal practices because they are being shielded. Failure to do so could lead to both interpersonal and communal violence.21,22\n\nMental Health\nConsideration: Ensure mental health and psychosocial support*,23 structures are in place to address increased stress and anxiety.\n\nExplanation: Additional stress and worry are common during any epidemic and may be more pronounced with COVID-19 due to the novelty of the disease and increased fear of infection, increased childcare responsibilities due to school closures, and loss of livelihoods. Thus, in addition to the risk of stigmatization and feeling of isolation, this shielding approach may have an important psychological impact and may lead to significant emotional distress, exacerbate existing mental illness or contribute to anxiety, depression, helplessness, grief, substance abuse, or thoughts of suicide among those who are separated or have been left behind. Shielded individuals with concurrent severe mental health conditions should not be left alone. There must be a caregiver allocated to them to prevent further protection risks such as neglect and abuse.\n\nSummary\nThe shielding approach is an ambitious undertaking, which may prove effective in preventing COVID-19 infection among high-risk populations if well managed. While the premise is based on mitigation strategies used in the United Kingdom,24,25 there is no empirical evidence whether this approach will increase, decrease or have no effect on morbidity and mortality during the COVID-19 epidemic in various humanitarian settings. This document highlights a) risks and challenges of implementing this approach, b) need for additional resources in areas with limited or reduced capacity, c) indefinite timeline, and d) possible short-term and long-term adverse consequences.\n\nPublic health not only focuses on the eradication of disease but addresses the entire spectrum of health and wellbeing. Populations displaced, due to natural disasters or war and, conflict are already fragile and have experienced increased mental, physical and/or emotional trauma. While the shielding approach is not meant to be coercive, it may appear forced or be misunderstood in humanitarian settings. As with many community interventions meant to decrease COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, compliance and behavior change are the primary rate-limiting steps and may be driven by social and emotional factors. These changes are difficult in developed, stable settings; thus, they may be particularly challenging in humanitarian settings which bring their own set of multi-faceted challenges that need to be taken into account.\n\nHousehold-level shielding seems to be the most feasible and dignified as it allows for the least disruption to family structure and lifestyle, critical components to maintaining compliance. However, it is most susceptible to the introduction of a virus due to necessary movement or interaction outside the green zone, less oversight, and often large household sizes. It may be less feasible in settings where family shelters are small and do not have multiple compartments. In humanitarian settings, small village, sector/block, or camp-level shielding may allow for greater adherence to proposed protocol, but at the expense of longer-term social impacts triggered by separation from friends and family, feelings of isolation, and stigmatization. Most importantly, accidental introduction of the virus into a green zone may result in rapid transmission and increased morbidity and mortality as observed in assisted care facilities in the US.26\n\nThe shielding approach is intended to alleviate stress on the healthcare system and circumvent the negative economic consequences of long-term containment measures and lockdowns by protecting the most vulnerable.1,24,25 Implementation of this approach will involve careful planning, additional resources, strict adherence and strong multi-sector coordination, requiring agencies to consider the potential repercussion among populations that have collectively experienced physical and psychological trauma which makes them more vulnerable to adverse psychosocial consequences.  In addition, thoughtful consideration of the potential benefit versus the social and financial cost of implementation will be needed in humanitarian settings.",

            "Text": "Grieving the loss of a loved one during the fear and anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic can be overwhelming. It may be difficult for people to make decisions about how to safely grieve and honor their loved one. This guidance is for individuals and families as they work with funeral directors, community and religious leaders, and others to plan and hold funeral services and visitations during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHelp lower the risk of spreading COVID-19 by following these guiding principles.\n\nGuiding Principles\n\nThe more people interact, the closer in distance the interaction is (less than 6 feet), and the longer the interaction lasts, the higher the risk of spreading COVID-19.\nThe higher the level of community transmission in an area, the higher the risk of spreading COVID-19.\nMasks help lower the risk of spreading COVID-19, particularly if social distancing cannot be maintained.\nDuring an in-person gathering, convene in outdoors or in well-ventilated areas, if possible, rather than poorly ventilated, indoor areas to help lower risk of spreading COVID-19. Outdoor gatherings are safer than indoor gatherings.\nAvoid sharing commonly used objects such as religious aids (e.g., religious books, collection plates, programs, etc.,) to help lower the risk of spreading COVID-19.\nReducing the number of people who are engaged in activities like singing or chanting as these behaviors can increase the amount of respiratory virus in the air.\nPractice increased hand hygiene, and cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces and objects to help lower the risk of spreading COVID-19.\nPractice social distancing by maintaining at least 6 feet between attendees; facility or lay staff; and clergy or officiants, especially when small, in-person services are held.\nTake extra precautions for those at increased risk for COVID-19, particularly those who are older or have pre-existing conditions, to help lower the risk of spreading COVID-19.\nThe risk of COVID-19 spreading at gatherings and services is ranked as follows, from lowest to highest:\n\nLowest risk: Virtual-only services and gatherings.\n\nLower risk: Smaller outdoor, in-person services and gatherings in which individuals from different households remain spaced at least 6 feet apart, wear masks, do not share objects, and come from the same local area (e.g., community, town, city, or county).\n\nHigher risk: Medium-sized in-person services and gatherings, either indoors or outdoors, adapted to allow individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart, with some individuals wearing face masks and with some attendees coming from outside the local area. Sharing of items or objects is limited.\n\nHighest risk: Large in-person services and gatherings held indoors and where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart; many attendees travel from outside the local area. Few individuals wear masks and objects are shared.\n\nIn some situations, many people have become sick with COVID-19 after attending a funeral service. To help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in communities, changes need to be made to the way funerals, visitations, and memorials to the deceased are held. This guidance provides strategies to protect yourself and others when you are grieving the loss of a loved one, supporting each other, making funeral arrangements, and participating in funeral services and visitations. Some examples include:\n\nUsing technology to connect virtually with family and friends during the grieving process.\nConsidering modified funeral arrangements, such as limiting attendance at funerals held during shortly after the time of death to a small number of immediate family members and friends; and then holding additional memorial services when social distancing guidelines are less restrictive.\nPracticing social distancing by maintaining at least 6 feet between attendees, facility staff, and clergy or officiants when small, in-person services are held.\nConsidering modifications to funeral rites and rituals (for example, avoid touching the deceased person\u2019s body or personal belongings or other ceremonial objects) to make sure of everyone\u2019s safety.\nWearing masks while around others and outside of your home.\nGrieving the loss of a loved one\nGrief is a normal response to losing someone important to you. When a loved one dies, it is important for friends and family to be able to share stories and memories of the person and how they influenced their lives. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the ability of friends and family to come together in person and grieve in typical ways. This is true regardless of whether the person\u2019s death was due to COVID-19 or some other cause.\n\nGiven the COVID-19 pandemic, hosting gatherings now could be dangerous to those who would want to participate. Family and friends are finding alternate ways to connect, support each other, and grieve after their loss. They understand the need to possibly plan for additional memorial services when COVID-19-related restrictions are lifted.\n\nTake actions to help you cope with the loss of a loved one\nGrief is a universal emotion, but no two people experience grief in exactly the same way. Some actions you can take to help you cope with feelings of grief while practicing social distancing and honoring your loved one include:\n\nInvite people to call you, or host conference calls with family members and friends to stay connected.\nAsk family and friends to share stories and pictures with you via phone, video chat, email, text message, photo sharing apps, social media, or mailed letters.\nCreate a virtual memory book, blog, or webpage to remember your loved one, and ask family and friends to contribute their memories and stories.\nCoordinate a date and time for family and friends to honor your loved one by reciting a selected poem, spiritual reading, or prayer from within their own households. Some cultures practice a prolonged mourning period with multiple observances, so hosting virtual events now and in-person events later may be in keeping with these practices.\nSeek spiritual support from faith-based organizations, including religious leaders and congregations, if applicable. People who are not part of a faith tradition or religious community can seek support from other trusted community leaders and friends.\nUse grief counseling services, support groups, or hotlinesexternal icon, especially those that can be offered over the phone or online, or seek support from a mental healthcare provider.\nRead books about grief and loss. If you have children, read age-appropriate books with them and talk with them about how they are feeling.\nTake part in an activity that has significance to you and the loved one you have lost, such as planting flowers or a tree or preparing a favorite meal, in memory of your loved one.\nReview additional information from CDC on loss and grief, and ways to cope with stress and anxiety.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the family and close friends of a person who died of COVID-19 may experience stigma, such as people avoiding them or rejecting them. Stigma hurts everyone by creating fear or anger toward other people. Some people may avoid contact with you, your family members, and friends when they would normally reach out to you. You can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with extended family, friends, and others in your community.\n\nMaking Funeral Arrangements\nCOVID-19 does not need to affect whether the funeral takes place through burial or cremation.  Wishes of your deceased family member or friend may continue to be honored.\nIn general, there is no need to delay funeral services and visitations due to COVID-19. However, some changes to traditional practices are likely needed. Family members may need to discuss timing of services with funeral service providers, who may be overwhelmed.\nCOVID-19 is a new disease, and we are still learning how it spreads.There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral service or visitation with the body of a deceased person who had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 after the body has been prepared for viewing.\nTake precautions when planning and holding funeral services and visitations to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among those in attendance, including those who may not have symptoms.\nPractice social distancing while making funeral arrangements\n\nConsider having virtual or phone meetings instead of in-person meetings with funeral home staff, cemetery staff, clergy or officiants, and others to plan funeral arrangements.\nIf you need to meet in person, follow everyday preventive actions to protect yourself and others from COVID-19, such as wearing a mask, social distancing, washing your hands often, and covering coughs and sneezes.\nDo not attend in-person meetings if you are sick or if you might have been exposed to COVID-19. Those who have higher risk of severe illness should weigh the benefits of in-person attendance against risk of exposure to a person with COVID-19, especially if recommendations for wearing masks and social distancing may be difficult to follow for themselves or others.\nDiscuss options for making changes to traditional funeral plans\nDiscuss your cultural or religious traditions and the funeral wishes of the deceased, if applicable, with family members and the people you are working with (funeral home staff, clergy, or officiants).\nIdentify any potential concerns and determine options to make changes to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Preserve traditional practices when it is possible to safely do so, and identify whether modified or new practices could satisfy the needs and values of you and your loved one.\nConsider whether it would be acceptable to hold modified funeral arrangements by limiting attendance to a small number of immediate family members and friends shortly after the time of death. Consider holding additional memorial services in the future when social distancing guidelines are less restrictive.\nWhen you are making decisions about who should attend, consider how emotionally difficult social distancing practices might be for attendees (such as keeping at least 6 feet apart and not hugging other attendees who do not live in their household).\nAsk the people you are working with (funeral home staff, clergy, or officiant) about resources they may be able to provide, such as:\nVirtual funeral services, visitations, and memorial tributes by online video streaming or recorded video. Consider potential issues with virtual attendees\u2019 access to technology and high-speed internet, as well as how any technological difficulties during the service could impact the event.\nOnline guestbooks or memory books that invite people to share stories, notes of condolence, or photos.\nAssistance with sharing details about the plan for funeral services and visitations with extended family and friends, including how to compassionately communicate any changes to traditional practices and the reasons they are necessary.\nHolding funeral services and visitations\nFamilial and cultural expectations might put pressure on you and others to participate in or hold or schedule funeral services and visitations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, those expectations may need to be relaxed to protect the safety of those who would have participated. People continue to get exposed to COVID-19 at funeral services; the people giving it to others were not feeling sick at the time and did not know they were carrying or spreading COVID-19.\n\nConsider the following modifications to funeral services and visitations to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. These modifications are recommended for events held in any setting, including funeral homes, cemetery facilities, places of worship, private homes, and other venues.\n\nLimit the attendees to a small number of immediate family and close friends\nFollow the guidelines from state and local officials and state and localexternal icon health departments.\nThose who are sick, have a household member or other close contact who is sick. Those who have higher risk of severe illness should weigh the benefits of in-person attendance against risk of exposure to a person with COVID-19, especially if recommendations for wearing masks and social distancing may be difficult to follow for themselves or others\nConsider limiting the number of people from different areas of the country or any areas with significant spread of COVID-19.\nConsider offering other ways for family and friends to participate, such as by phone or online (live or recorded).\nPractice social distancing and everyday preventive actions\nConsider holding services and gatherings in a large, well-ventilated area or outdoors, as circumstances and traditions allow.\nSpace out seating for attendees who do not live in the same household to at least 6 feet apart between household groups.\nAttendees who do not live in the same household should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) apart and wear a mask when interacting with people who do not live in their household.\nPeople who have been living in the same household can comfort each other in typical ways such as hugging, holding hands, and sitting next to each other.\nAttendees should nod, bow, or wave instead of holding or shaking hands, hugging, or kissing anyone who does not live in their household.\nConsider limiting the number of people engaged in activities that produce respiratory droplets, which may contain virus, (e.g., singing or chanting) especially when participants are indoors and in close proximity to each other. If attendees choose to sing or chant, encourage them to wear masks and increase distance between people to greater than 6 feet.\nAll attendees should follow everyday preventive actions to protect themselves and others from COVID-19, such as washing your hands often and covering coughs and sneezes.\nConsider changing traditional rituals or practices\nDiscuss with the funeral home director, clergy or officiant, and your family any potential changes that might be necessary to protect all of the participants and attendees. Consider options for modified or new practices that would be acceptable to you and your family and friends, such as:\n\nHolding a graveside-only service.\nChanging or removing funeral practices that involve close contact or sharing things among members of different households, such as:\nSharing a car or limousine ride between the church and cemetery.\nProviding food and beverages for attendees after the service.\nChanging religious rituals in consultation with clergy and other religious leaders.\nIf some traditions, such as certain religious rituals, sharing rides to the gravesite, or having food and beverages, are considered essential to you and your family and friends, consider modifying them.\n\nLimit sharing of items, such as worship aids, prayer books, and other items shared or passed by clergy and attendees during religious rituals.\nGroup household members together inside the vehicle. Avoid having non-household members sharing vehicles to travel between locations during the services; if necessary, increase ventilation by opening windows or using the air conditioner on non-recirculating mode.\nIf food is offered at a reception, have individual pre-packaged boxes or bags instead of a potluck, buffet, or family-style meal. Avoid sharing of foods and utensils.\nIn some cultures, bringing food or gifts to grieving family members is an important way to express care and concern. During the COVID-19 pandemic, consider expressing care in ways that do not involve personal interactions. Consider delivering food or gifts to grieving family members in ways that keep people at least 6 feet apart, mailing care packages, or giving families gift cards for food delivery services.\n\nAvoid touching the deceased person\u2019s body before preparation\nThere are many different cultural traditions involved in the bereavement process, including some that involve touching the deceased person\u2019s body before preparation. Though we are still learning more about how COVID-19 spreads, it may be possible that you could get COVID-19 by touching the body of a deceased person who had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 prior to the body being prepared for viewing. After the body has been prepared for viewing, there may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging.\n\nTake steps to protect yourself, such as:\n\nAvoid touching, hugging, or kissing the body of a deceased person who had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 before and during body preparation, especially if you or a member of your household are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.\nWash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after any contact with the body. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.\nTake precautions with rituals that involve touching the deceased person\u2019s body\nIf the deceased person had confirmed or suspected COVID-19, avoid kissing, washing, or shrouding the body before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. Take precautions if participating in these activities is part of important religious or cultural practices.\n\nWork with your cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff to identify how to reduce exposure as much as possible.\nPeople at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 and members of their household should not be involved in these activities.\nPeople conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves (nitrile, latex, or rubber). Additional protective equipment may also be required, such as disposable and waterproof isolation gowns, face shields or goggles, and facemasks (e.g., if splashing of fluids is expected).\nFollowing preparation of the body, safely remove gloves (and other protective equipment, if used) and throw them away. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Shower as soon as possible.\nIf you did not wear an isolation gown while preparing the body, wash your clothes in the warmest setting possible and dry them completely.\nIf removing personal possessions (such as wedding rings) from the body or casket, clean and disinfectexternal icon the items and wash hands right away.\nSafely gather your loved one\u2019s belongings\nIf desired, you may retrieve the belongings of a loved one who has died of COVID-19 outside their home (for example, in a hospital setting). Depending on local rules and regulations, family members may retrieve these belongings at the funeral home or the healthcare facility.\n\nYou should use gloves and practice good hand hygiene when handling your loved ones\u2019 belongings. Depending on the type of belongings, such as electronics, you should also follow the household item-specific cleaning and disinfection guidelines when handling these items.",

            "HeadLine": "Scaling Up Staffing Roles in Case Investigation and Contact Tracing",
            "Text": "Successful case investigation and contact tracing for COVID-19 is dependent on a robust and well-trained public health workforce. Many are familiar with case investigation and contact tracing as a core strategy used in outbreak investigations (CDC Field Epidemiology Manual). It has also been implemented for decades by Communicable Disease Investigators (CDI) or Disease Intervention Specialists (DIS) in health departments throughout the United States to prevent and control tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections, HIV, and other infectious diseases, as well as to respond to outbreaks.\n\nTo be most effective, case investigation and contact tracing requires staff with adequate training, language skills, cultural sensitivity, supervision, and access to social and medical support for clients and their contacts.\n\nOne way to quickly scale up surge capacity for case investigation and contact tracing is to specify two explicit job tasks for designated staff:\n\nJob Task 1. Case Investigation \u2013 Interviewing clients with COVID-19, eliciting their close contacts, monitoring the clients for COVID-19 symptoms, connecting clients to resources to support self-isolation\n\nJob Task 2. Contact Tracing \u2013 Notifying close contacts of their potential exposure, referring them to testing, monitoring them for COVID-19 symptoms, connecting contacts to resources to support self-quarantine\n\nCase investigation and contact tracing can be handled by one properly trained person when the number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 and their close contacts can be interviewed by the staff member within 24 hours of being reported to the health department. When the number of reported daily cases does not allow for case interviews within 24 hours, a divided approach employing several staff can provide a focused scope of activity and streamlines the training competencies for the surge workforce. One staff member (case investigator) interviews and elicits contacts from a patient diagnosed with COVID-19, and additional staff members (contact tracers) notify and follow-up with the patient\u2019s contacts. This approach requires excellent communication between staff to ensure clarity and prompt transfer of information, limited redundancy, and cohesive messaging to clients with COVID-19 and their contacts. Given each patient with COVID-19 will likely have multiple close contacts, staffing plans should include a greater number of contact tracers to meet this demand.  \n\nPublic health personnel with infection control, worker safety, and health expertise may be needed to support case investigation and contact tracing within healthcare facilities (e.g., hospitals, acute care centers), critical infrastructure settings (e.g., meat and poultry processing facilities, grocery stores), and other congregate living or workplace settings (e.g., long-term care facilities, correctional facilities). These complex investigations require the application of infection control principles to make appropriate recommendations and protect additional residents and workers from infection. Occupational health specialists can also be engaged to assess COVID-19-related protocols in place to promote workers\u2019 health and safety.\n\nScaling up case investigation and contact tracing efforts ideally involves a large multidisciplinary workforce under the daily oversight and management of a leadership team with subject matter expertise. The table below outlines the various roles of key public health staff needed. There may be variability in the title and classification of staff conducting these activities; however, the roles appear to be fairly consistent across jurisdictions. Depending on the jurisdiction, each role may be assigned to an individual staff member or one staff member may cover several roles.\n\nRoles and Responsibilities of Key Public Health Staff to Support COVID-19 Case Investigation & Contact Tracing\nRoles and Responsibilities of Key Public Health Staff to Support COVID-19 Case Investigation & Contact Tracing\nRole\nDescription\nExisting Public Health Classifications Performing these Activities\nSurge Capacity Workforce* with Required Training\nSurveillance Triage and Support\tProcesses incoming laboratory and provider reports in surveillance system.

            "HeadLine": "FAQ for School Administrators on Reopening Schools",
            "Text": "Planning and Responding to COVID-19\nWhat can communities do to support schools to reopen safely for in-person instruction?\nSchools are an essential part of the infrastructure of communities, as they provide safe, supportive learning environments for students, employ teachers and other staff, and enable parents, guardians, and caregivers to go to work. Schools also provide critical services that help to mitigate health disparities, such as school meal programs, social, physical, behavioral, and mental health services. Communities should make every effort to support the reopening of schools safely for in person learning in the fall.\n\nFrom other countries, we know that schools can reopen safely for in-person learning in communities with low rates of COVID-19 spread if appropriate precautions are taken.1,2 The creation of a local cross-sectional task force comprised of local decision makers, education leaders, and representatives of school staff, families, local health officials, and other community members can support identifying mitigation strategies for their community, given their local context, that can decrease community transmission levels now and throughout the fall.\n\nThe health, safety, and well-being of students, teachers, staff, and their families are the most important consideration in determining whether schools should reopen for in-person learning.\n\nWhat is cohorting, and how does it work?\nOne important strategy that administrators can consider is cohorting (or forming \u201cpods\u201d). Cohorting forms groups of students, and sometimes teachers or staff, that stay together throughout the school day to minimize exposure for students, teachers, and staff across the school environment.\n\nIdeally, students and staff within a cohort would only have physical proximity with others in the same cohort. This practice may help prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, by limiting cross-over of students, teachers, and staff to the extent possible, thus:\n\ndecreasing opportunities for exposure to or transmission of SARS-CoV-2,\nfacilitating more efficient contact tracing in the event of a positive case, and\nallowing for targeted testing, quarantine, and isolation of a single cohort instead of school-wide measures in the event of a positive case or cluster of cases.\nCohorting can be done as part of a traditional model with all students attending school in-person, on a full-time basis, or as part of a of a hybrid school model (i.e., students attending in-person school on an alternating schedule). Different strategies may be needed for elementary, middle, and high schools. Cohorting is a commonly used strategy in many elementary schools, in which students have the same teacher and classmates during the entire day and often for the entire school year. Implementation of this strategy varies, depending on setting and resources. For example, schools may keep cohorts together in one classroom, and have teachers rotate between cohorts. Alternatively, schools may assign student cohorts to specific days or weeks for in-person and online learning.\n\nHow is cohorting different from class size? Are there maximum or minimum cohort sizes that might help reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission?\nTo date, there is no published scientific study on optimal maximum or minimum cohort sizes in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission among school-aged children in a camp or school setting in the United States. However, CDC modeling demonstrates that smaller cohort sizes are generally associated with less transmission in schools. Smaller cohorts means more limited contacts, but there is no specific threshold for optimal size. Even with smaller groups, cohorts may not be truly independent of one another. Families may have children of different ages (i.e., siblings) who act as connections between cohorts within a school. Teachers, especially with specialized expertise, may also connect multiple cohorts within a school because their expertise is used/needed across cohorts. Use of masks and distancing when possible are particularly important when teachers are moving amongst groups of students.\n\nCohorting may be implemented as one of a variety of mitigation strategies that schools can use to help minimize SARS-CoV-2 transmission. It is important that schools balance community transmission risk, various mitigation strategies (e.g., limiting class sizes, use of masks, proper hygiene, school cleaning), and students\u2019 educational and emotional needs when developing plans for reopening.\n\nWhat is meant by an alternating schedule and what are its advantages or disadvantages?\nAn alternating schedule is when students rotate when they physically attend school. This is also sometimes called a hybrid schedule (mix of in-person and virtual school). For example, certain grades or classrooms may attend school on Monday and Tuesday while other grades or classrooms may attend on Thursday and Friday. The school would be thoroughly cleaned on Wednesday. As another example, some schools internationally have rotated in-person attendance weekly with one group of students attending during a week, followed by a different group the next week in rotation.2\n\nCDC is currently examining different alternating scheduling durations and strategies to assess their potential impact on SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk in school. Preliminary modeling results suggest that \u2013 similar to cohorting \u2013 alternating schedules can help reduce contact between students and staff, and both alternating days and alternating weeks of in-person instruction have the potential to reduce in-school transmission of SARS-CoV-2 compared with daily in-person instruction. While alternating schedules may reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk, there may be additional costs related to lesson planning for teachers, childcare costs for parents, and other potential costs. More research is needed on the layered impact of alternating schedules with other SARS-CoV-2 mitigation strategies (e.g., social distancing, masks, proper hygiene, and cohorting) as well as the impact of alternating schedules on students\u2019 learning and well-being.\n\nWhat can school staff do to protect themselves and others from getting sick with COVID-19?\nSchool staff can take everyday preventive actions to protect themselves and others from getting sick with COVID-19:\n\nWashing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.\nCovering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or inside of elbow, throwing the tissue away, and then washing hands.\nAvoiding touching one\u2019s eyes, nose, mouth, and mask.\nMaintaining distance of at least 6 feet from other adults, and from students when feasible.\nWearing a mask especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.\nCleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, including tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.\nStaying home when sick, or after being in close contact with a person with COVID-19.\nLimiting use of shared objects (e.g., gym or physical education equipment, art supplies, games) when possible, and cleaning and disinfecting these objects frequently.\nHow can students ride the school bus safely?\nSchool systems can implement a number of strategies to reduce the risk of transmission on buses:\n\nDrivers should practice all safety actions and protocols as indicated above for other school staff (e.g., hand hygiene, masks). Similar to frequently touched surfaces, buses should be cleaned and disinfected at least daily using EPA-approved disinfectantsexternal icon.\nDrivers can create distance between children on school buses, including seating children one student per row facing forward and skipping rows between students. However, students who live in the same household may sit together if needed. Schools may consider alternative strategies to accommodate the reduced number of students in buses, such as staggered pick up and drop off times or additional bus routes.\nSchools should consider having spare, clean masks available to ensure all students wear masks on the school bus.\nDrivers can open bus windows to increase circulation of outdoor air, but should ensure that doing so does not pose a safety or health risk (e.g., risk of falling).\nDuring dismissal, schools may provide physical guides, such as signs and tape on the sidewalk, to ensure that students and school staff remain at least 6 feet apart while waiting for transportation.\nWhat strategies can schools use to help students, teachers and staff be successful in reducing the risk of spreading SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19?\nCurrently, the most effective way to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is using multiple mitigation strategies in combination. This may include students, teachers, and staff staying home when sick; appropriately covering coughs and sneezes; wearing masks; social distancing; cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces; and washing hands often with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.  Some of these strategies may be new for students, teachers, and staff to implement in the school setting. Therefore, increased education, training, and having protocols to ensure these strategies are implemented as intended are necessary to increase the likelihood of reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nSchools can educate staff and families about when they or their child(ren) should stay home and when they can return to school, while actively encouraging employees and students who are sick or who have recently had close contact with a person with COVID-19 to stay home. Schools can teach and reinforce handwashing practices among all students, teachers, and staff. Schools can also use physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks, one-way routes in hallways, and signs on walls to help students, teachers, and staff remain at least 6 feet apart. Schools can implement flexible sick leave policies and practices that enable staff to stay home when they are sick, have been exposed, or are caring for someone who is sick.\n\nCan physical distance between students in the classroom be less than 6 feet?\nIn general, the closer, longer, and more frequent the interaction between students, teachers and staff, the higher the risk of respiratory droplets being passed between people. Therefore, CDC recommends keeping a distance of at least 6 feet from other people, in addition to practicing other behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19 like wearing masks, washing hands often with soap and water, and staying home when sick. Additionally, it is important to ensure ventilation systems operate properly to increase circulation of outdoor air as much as possible.\n\nWhen maintaining 6 feet of distance is not feasible, try keeping as close to 6 feet apart as possible, recognizing that the closer you are, the more likely it is for respiratory droplets to be passed between people. In situations where maintaining physical distance is difficult, it is especially important to wear masks. In areas where it is difficult for individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart (e.g., reception desks), schools can consider additional strategies such as installing physical barriers, such as sneeze guards and partitions. Schools can also consider using outdoor space, weather-permitting, to enable social distancing.\n\nWhat have other countries done when they reopened school for in-person learning?\nInternationally, schools have responded to COVID-19 by using a variety of approaches.1,2 Most countries have changed the way their schools operate. These changes have included reducing class sizes, increasing physical distance between students, and cohorting. Many countries have staggered attendance and their start and dismissal times, or they have created alternating shifts of students to enable social distancing. In some places, this approach has meant that only certain students have returned to in-person learning, either by varying grades attending in-person, or varying attendance by need. For example:\nDenmark was the first European country to reopen schools. Denmark staggered students\u2019 reentry dates (e.g., one group started school first, followed by another group at a later date). Denmark limited class sizes and used other social distancing measures.1 Younger students (under age 12) returned first based on their likely lower health risk, need for more supervision, and lower benefit from virtual learning compared to older students. Class sizes were reduced to allow physical distancing. Denmark has seen decreased infections among all age groups since schools reopened.3\nIn comparison to Denmark, Germany reopened for older students with students attending in alternating shifts to ensure a maximum class size of 10.2\nCould reopening schools lead to increased rates of COVID-19?\nEvidence from schools throughout the world suggests that reopening schools may be low risk in communities with low SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates.4 Computer simulations from Europe have suggested that schools reopening may further increase spread in communities where transmission is already high.4 As schools reopen, more will be learned about the feasibility and effectiveness of mitigation strategies such as wearing masks and keeping people 6 feet apart through social distancing.  Regardless of the level of community transmission, vigilance to practicing behaviors that prevent spread among everyone at school and taking other recommended actions to plan, prepare, and respond to COVID-19 will lower the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission than it might otherwise would be.\n\nWhat should schools do if a student or school staff member tests positive for COVID-19?\nSchools should have a plan to respond if someone within the school \u2014 a student, teacher, or staff member \u2014 tests positive for COVID-19. The plan should be communicated to parents, bearing in mind privacy concerns. Assessing the level of risk is important in determining an appropriate response. School administrators can also refer to CDC\u2019s Interim Considerations for K-12 School Administrators for SARS-Co-V-2 testing, which describes scenarios when K-12 students or staff may need to have a viral diagnostic test.\n\nIn most instances, a single case of COVID-19 in a school would not warrant closing the entire school. Community spread and how much contact the person with COVID-19 had with others, as well as when such contact took place, need to be considered. These variables should also be considered when determining how long a school, or part of the school, stays closed. If the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within a school is higher than in the community, or if the school is the source of an outbreak, administrators should work with local health officials to determine if temporarily closing the school building is necessary. Students, teachers, and staff who test positive or had close contact with anyone who tested positive should be provided with guidance for when it is safe to discontinue self-isolation or end quarantine.\n\nWhat about students and staff (or their family members) who are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19?\nSome students and school staff (or their family members) may be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Schools may offer options for staff at increased risk for severe illness that limit their risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., telework, modified job responsibilities). Schools may also offer options for students at increased risk that limit their risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., virtual learning opportunities). Schools should establish policies to protect the privacy of students, teachers, school staff, and families at increased risk for severe illness because of age or certain underlying medical conditions, in accordance with applicable privacy laws (e.g., Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, Americans with Disabilities Actexternal icon). Schools may also consider planning for life events and circumstances that can affect students and staff members (e.g., unexpectedly caring for a family member at increased risk for severe illness).\n\nWhat is symptom screening and does CDC recommend it for students and staff?\nBased on the available evidence, CDC does not currently recommend universal (widespread) symptom screenings be conducted by schools. Parents or caregivers should be strongly encouraged to monitor their children for signs of infectious illness, and students who are sick should not attend school.\n\nWhat is universal testing and does CDC recommend it for students and staff?\nUniversal testing refers to testing all students and staff in school settings for SARS-CoV-2, regardless of whether they are showing symptoms or have a known exposure to someone with COVID-19.\n\nCDC does not recommend universal testing of all students and staff for several reasons:\n\nViral testing only provides COVID-19 status for individuals at the time of testing.\nOne-time or universal entry testing could miss COVID-19 cases in the early stages of infection, and it could miss exposures that happen after testing.\nImplementing a universal approach to testing in schools may pose challenges, such as the lack of infrastructure to support routine testing and follow up in the school setting; unknown acceptability of this testing approach among students, parents, and staff; lack of dedicated resources; practical considerations related to testing minors; and potential disruption in the educational environment.\nHow should schools serve meals to students and staff?\nIn addition to having nutrition services staff continue to follow recommended food safety practices for preparing and serving food:\n\nSchools should avoid offering any self-serve food or drink options, such as hot and cold food bars, salad or condiment bars, and drink stations.\nSchools should serve individually plated or pre-packaged meals, while ensuring the safety of children with food allergies pdf icon[108 pages, 8 MB].\nAs feasible, schools should have students and staff eat meals in classrooms, while maintaining social distancing as much as possible, instead of in a communal dining hall or cafeteria.\nIf communal dining halls or cafeterias are used, schools should encourage social distancing in food service lines and at tables while eating.\nStudents and staff should wash their hands with soap and water for 20 seconds or use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol before and after eating.\nSchools should clean and disinfect food line areas, tables, and chairs between uses.\nSchools should encourage students and staff not to share food or utensils and use disposable food service items (e.g., utensils, trays). If use of disposable items is not possible, ensure that all non-disposable food service items and equipment are handled by staff with gloves and washed with dish soap and hot water or in a dishwasher.\nIndividuals should wash their hands after removing their gloves or after directly handling used food service items.\nLastly, if food is offered at any event, schools may consider:\nHaving pre-packaged boxes or bags for each attendee instead of a buffet or family-style meal.\nProviding tissues and no-touch or foot pedal disposal receptacles for use by students, staff, and food service volunteers.\nIf possible, installing touchless payment methods. If touchless payment is not possible, providing hand sanitizer to students and staff for use right after handling money, cards, or keypads.\nAt what point should schools close for in-person learning?\nThe decision to close schools for in-person learning should be made together by local officials \u2013 including school administrators and public health officials \u2014 in a manner that is transparent for students, staff, parents, caregivers and guardians, and all community members.\n\nThe decision to close schools for in-person learning should take into account a number of factors, such as:\n\nthe importance of in-person education to the social, emotional, and academic growth and well-being of students;\nthe level of community transmission;\nwhether cases have been identified among students and staff;\nother indicators that local public health officials are using to assess the status of COVID-19 in their area; and\nwhether student and staff cohorts have been implemented within the school, which would allow for the quarantining of affected cohorts rather than full school closure.",

            "Text": "Long-standing systemic health and social inequities have put many people from racial and ethnic minority groups at increased risk of getting sick and dying from COVID-19. The term \u201cracial and ethnic minority groups\u201d includes people of color with a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences. But some experiences are common to many people within these groups, and social determinants of health have historically prevented them from having fair opportunities for economic, physical, and emotional health. [1]\n\n\nThere is increasing evidence that some racial and ethnic minority groups are being disproportionately affected by COVID-19. [2], [3], [4], [5], [6] Inequities in the social determinants of health, such as poverty and healthcare access, affecting these groups are interrelated and influence a wide range of health and quality-of-life outcomes and risks.[1] To achieve health equity, barriers must be removed so that everyone has a fair opportunity to be as healthy as possible.\n\nFactors that contribute to increased risk\nSome of the many inequities in social determinants of health that put racial and ethnic minority groups at increased risk of getting sick and dying from COVID-19 include:\n\nDiscrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination exists in systems meant to protect well-being or health. Examples of such systems include health care, housing, education, criminal justice, and finance. Discrimination, which includes racism, can lead to chronic and toxic stress and shapes social and economic factors that put some people from racial and ethnic minority groups at increased risk for COVID-19.[5], [7], [8], [9]\nHealthcare access and utilization: People from some racial and ethnic minority groups are more likely to be uninsured than non-Hispanic whites. [10] Healthcare access can also be limited for these groups by many other factors, such as lack of transportation, child care, or ability to take time off of work; communication and language barriers; cultural differences between patients and providers; and historical and current discrimination in healthcare systems. [11] Some people from racial and ethnic minority groups may hesitate to seek care because they distrust the government and healthcare systems responsible for inequities in treatment [12] and historical events such as the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the African American Male and sterilization without people\u2019s permission. [13], [14], [15], [16]\nOccupation: People from some racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately represented in essential work settings such as healthcare facilities, farms, factories, grocery stores, and public transportation. [17] Some people who work in these settings have more chances to be exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19 due to several factors, such as close contact with the public or other workers, not being able to work from home, and not having paid sick days. [18]\nEducational, income, and wealth gaps: Inequities in access to high-quality education for some racial and ethnic minority groups can lead to lower high school completion rates and barriers to college entrance. This may limit future job options and lead to lower paying or less stable jobs. [19] People with limited job options likely have less flexibility to leave jobs that may put them at a higher risk of exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19. People in these situations often cannot afford to miss work, even if they\u2019re sick, because they do not have enough money saved up for essential items like food and other important living needs.\nHousing: Some people from racial and ethnic minority groups live in crowded conditions that make it more challenging to follow prevention strategies. In some cultures, it is common for family members of many generations to live in one household. In addition, growing and disproportionate unemployment rates for some racial and ethnic minority groups during the COVID-19 pandemic[19] may lead to greater risk of eviction and homelessness or sharing of housing.\nThese factors and others are associated with more COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in areas where racial and ethnic minority groups live, learn, work, play, and worship.[5],[10], [20], [21] They have also contributed to higher rates of some medical conditions that increase one\u2019s risk of severe illness from COVID-19. In addition, community strategies to slow the spread of COVID-19 may cause unintentional harm, such as lost wages, reduced access to services, and increased stress, for some racial and ethnic minority groups. [22]\n\nWhat We Can Do\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may change some of the ways we connect and support each other. As individuals and communities respond to COVID-19 recommendations and circumstances (e.g., school closures, workplace closures, social distancing), there are often unintended negative impacts on emotional well-being such as loss of social connectedness and support.

Face coverings may prevent people who don\u2019t know they have the virus from spreading it to others.\n\nBe careful when putting on and taking off cloth face coverings.\nDon\u2019t touch the face covering while wearing it.\nDon\u2019t touch your face, mouth, nose, or eyes while taking off the covering.\nWash your hands before putting on and after taking off the covering.\nWash the covering after each use.\nCloth face coverings should not be worn if their use creates other risk (for example, interferes with driving or vision, or contributions to heat-related illness) that exceeds their COVID-19 related benefits of slowing the spread of the virus. Cloth face coverings should also not be worn by anyone who has trouble breathing or is unable to remove the covering without assistance. CDC provides information on adaptations and alternatives that should be considered when cloth faces coverings may not be feasible.\nCloth face coverings are not considered personal protective equipment (PPE) because they are designed to protect others, not the wearer. PPE may be required for inspections where there are known or suspected COVID-19 patients (such as a healthcare facility). See Infection Control Guidance for Healthcare Professionals about Coronavirus for more information.\nBe aware of contact with frequently touched surfaces.\n\nAvoid touching your mouth, nose, or eyes when handling frequently touched items.\nOnly bring necessary equipment to an inspection to minimize the number of items that need to be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.\nUse folders or envelopes to segregate paper records from other materials.\nWash your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You don\u2019t need to wear gloves if you wash your hands regularly (unless they are already required for your job).\n\nUse an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, if soap and water aren\u2019t available.\nWash your hands at these key times:\nBefore, during, and after preparing food.\nBefore eating food.\nAfter using the toilet.\nAfter blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.\nAfter putting on, touching, or removing cloth face coverings.\nBefore and after work and work breaks.\nAfter touching surfaces such as desks, door handles, clipboards, pens, cameras, cell phones, laptops, keyboards, or electronic tablets.\nDo not touch your face, mouth, nose, or eyes.\n\nCover your coughs and sneezes.\n\nUse tissues to cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze.\nThrow used tissues in the trash.",

            "Text": "As families and policymakers make decisions about their children returning to school, it is important to consider the full spectrum of benefits and risks of both in-person and virtual learning options.  Parents are understandably concerned about the safety of their children at school in the wake of COVID-19.  The best available evidence indicates if children become infected, they are far less likely to suffer severe symptoms.[1],[2],[3] Death rates among school-aged children are much lower than among adults.  At the same time, the harms attributed to closed schools on the social, emotional, and behavioral health, economic well-being, and academic achievement of children, in both the short- and long-term, are well-known and significant.  Further, the lack of in-person educational options disproportionately harms low-income and minority children and those living with disabilities.  These students are far less likely to have access to private instruction and care and far more likely to rely on key school-supported resources like food programs, special education services, counseling, and after-school programs to meet basic developmental needs.[4]\n\nAside from a child\u2019s home, no other setting has more influence on a child\u2019s health and well-being than their school.  The in-person school environment does the following:\n\nprovides educational instruction;\nsupports the development of social and emotional skills;\ncreates a safe environment for learning;\naddresses nutritional needs; and\nfacilitates physical activity.\nThis paper discusses each of these critical functions, following a brief summary of current studies regarding COVID-19 and children.\n\nCOVID-19 and Children\nThe best available evidence indicates that COVID-19 poses relatively low risks to school-aged children.  Children appear to be at lower risk for contracting COVID-19 compared to adults.  To put this in perspective, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as of July 17, 2020, the United States reported that children and adolescents under 18 years old account for under 7 percent of COVID-19 cases and less than 0.1 percent of COVID-19-related deaths.[5]  Although relatively rare, flu-related deaths in children occur every year. From 2004-2005 to 2018-2019, flu-related deaths in children reported to CDC during regular flu seasons ranged from 37 to 187 deaths.  During the H1N1pandemic (April 15, 2009 to October 2, 2010), 358 pediatric deaths were reported to CDC. So far in this pandemic, deaths of children are less than in each of the last five flu seasons, with only 64.\u2020 Additionally, some children with certain underlying medical conditions, however, are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19.*\n\nScientific studies suggest that COVID-19 transmission among children in schools may be low.  International studies that have assessed how readily COVID-19 spreads in schools also reveal low rates of transmission when community transmission is low.  Based on current data, the rate of infection among younger school children, and from students to teachers, has been low, especially if proper precautions are followed.  There have also been few reports of children being the primary source of COVID-19 transmission among family members.[6],[7],[8]  This is consistent with data from both virus and antibody testing, suggesting that children are not the primary drivers of COVID-19 spread in schools or in the community.[9],[10],[11]  No studies are conclusive, but the available evidence provides reason to believe that in-person schooling is in the best interest of students, particularly in the context of appropriate mitigation measures similar to those implemented at essential workplaces.\n\nEducational Instruction\nExtended school closure is harmful to children.  It can lead to severe learning loss, and the need for in-person instruction is particularly important for students with heightened behavioral needs.[12],[13]  Following the wave of school closures in March 2020 due to COVID-19, academic learning slowed for most children and stopped for some.  A survey of 477 school districts by the University of Washington\u2019s Center on Reinventing Public Education found that, \u201cfar too many schools are leaving learning to chance.\u201d[13]  Just one in three school districts expected teachers to provide instruction, track student engagement, or monitor academic progress for all students, and wealthy school districts were twice as likely to have such expectations compared to low-income districts.[13]\n\nWe also know that, for many students, long breaks from in-person education are harmful to student learning.  For example, the effects of summer breaks from in-person schooling on academic progress, known as \u201csummer slide,\u201d are also well-documented in the literature.  According to the Northwest Evaluation Association, in the summer following third grade, students lose nearly 20 percent of their school-year gains in reading and 27 percent of their school-year gains in math.[14] By the summer after seventh grade, students lose on average 39 percent of their school-year gains in reading and 50 percent of their school-year gains in math.[14]  This indicates that learning losses are large and become even more severe as a student progresses through school.  The prospect of losing several months of schooling, compared to the few weeks of summer vacation, due to school closure likely only makes the learning loss even more severe.\n\nDisparities in educational outcomes caused by school closures are a particular concern for low-income and minority students and students with disabilities.  Many low-income families do not have the capacity to facilitate distance learning (e.g. limited or no computer access, limited or no internet access), and may have to rely on school-based services that support their child\u2019s academic success.  A study by researchers at Brown and Harvard Universities assessed how 800,000 students used Zearn, an online math program, both before and after schools closed in March 2020.[15]  Data showed that through late April, student progress in math decreased by about half, with the negative impact more pronounced in low-income zip codes.[15]  Persistent achievement gaps that already existed before COVID-19, such as disparities across income levels and races, can worsen and cause serious, hard-to-repair damage to children\u2019s education outcomes.[15],[16]  Finally, remote learning  makes absorbing information more difficult for students with disabilities, developmental delays, or other cognitive disabilities.  In particular, students who are deaf, hard of hearing, have low vision, are blind, or have other learning disorders (e.g., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)) and other physical and mental disabilities have had significant difficulties with remote learning.[17]\n\nSocial and Emotional Skill Development\nSchools play a critical role in supporting the whole child, not just their academic achievement.  In addition to a structure for learning, schools provide a stable and secure environment for developing social skills and peer relationships.  Social interaction at school among children in grades PK-12 is particularly important for the development of language, communication, social, emotional, and interpersonal skills.[18]\n\nExtended school closures are harmful to children\u2019s development of social and emotional skills.  Important social interactions that facilitate the development of critical social and emotional skills are greatly curtailed or limited when students are not physically in school.  In an in-person school environment, children more easily learn how to develop and maintain friendships, how to behave in groups, and how to interact and form relationships with people outside of their family.  In school, students are also able to access support systems needed to recognize and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, appreciate others\u2019 perspectives, and make responsible decisions.  This helps reinforce children\u2019s feelings of school connectedness, or their belief that teachers and other adults at school care about them and their well-being.  Such routine in-person contacts provide opportunities to facilitate social-emotional development that are difficult, if not impossible, to replicate through distance learning.[18],[19],[20]\n\nAdditionally, extended closures can be harmful to children\u2019s mental health and can increase the likelihood that children engage in unhealthy behaviors.  An environment where students feel safe and connected, such as a school, is associated with lower levels of depression, thoughts about suicide, social anxiety, and sexual activity, as well as higher levels of self-esteem and more adaptive use of free time [19],[20]  A longitudinal study of 476 adolescents over 3 years starting in the 6th grade found school connectedness to be especially protective for those who had lower connectedness in other areas of their lives, such as home, and to reduce their likelihood of substance use.[20]  \n\nFurther, a review of studies conducted on pandemics found a strong association between length of quarantine and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder symptoms, avoidance behavior, and anger.  Another review published this year found that post-traumatic stress scores of children and parents in quarantine were four times higher than those not quarantined.[21],[22]\n\nIn-person schooling provides children with access to a variety of mental health and social services, including speech language therapy, and physical or occupational therapy to help the physical, psychological, and academic well-being of the child.[23], [24],[25],[26]  Further, school counselors are trained in the mental health needs of children and youth and can recognize signs of trauma that primary caregivers are less able to see because they themselves are experiencing the same family stresses.  School counselors can then coordinate with teachers to implement interventions to offer children a reassuring environment for regaining the sense of order, security, and normalcy.\n\nWithout in-person schooling, many children can lose access to these important services.  For example, we know that, even outside the context of school closures, children often do not receive the mental health treatment they need.  Among children ages 9-17, it is estimated that 21 percent, or more than 14 million children, experience some type of mental health condition.[27]  Yet only 16 percent of those with a condition receive any treatment.[23]  Of those, 70-80 percent received such care in a school setting.[23]  School closures can be particularly damaging for the 7.4 million American children suffering from a serious emotional disturbance.  For those individuals who have a diagnosable mental, behavioral or emotional condition that substantially interferes with or limits their social functioning, schools play an integral role in linking them to care and necessary support services.\n\nFor children with intellectual or physical disabilities, nearly all therapies and services are received through schools.  These vital services are difficult to provide through distance learning models.  As a result, more children with disabilities have received few to no services while schools have been closed.\n\nSafety\nExtended school closures deprive children who live in unsafe homes and neighborhoods of an important layer of protection from neglect as well as physical, sexual, and emotional maltreatment and abuse.  A 2018 Department of Health and Human Services report found that teachers and other educational staff were responsible for more than one-fifth of all reported child abuse cases\u2014more than any other category of reporter.[28]  During the COVID-19 school closures, however, there has been a sharp decline in reports of suspected maltreatment, but tragically a notable increase in evidence of abuse when children are seen for services.  For example, the Washington, D.C. Child and Family Services Agency recorded a 62 percent decrease in child abuse reporting calls between mid-March and April 2020 compared to the same time period in 2019, but saw more severe presentation of child abuse cases in emergency rooms.[29]  Children who live in a home or neighborhood where neglect, violence, or abuse occur, but who are not physically in school, are deprived of access to trained school professionals who can readily identify the signs of trauma and provide needed support and guidance.[30],[31],[32],[33],[34]\n\nNutrition\nExtended school closures can be harmful to the nutritional health of children.  Schools are essential to meeting the nutritional needs of children with many consuming up to half their daily calories at school.  Nationwide more than 30 million children participate in the National School Lunch Program and nearly 15 million participate in the School Breakfast Program.[35],[36]  For children from low-income families, school meals are an especially critical source of affordable, healthy foods.  While schools have implemented strategies to continue meal services throughout periods of school closures, it is difficult to maintain this type of school nutrition program over the long-term.  This is a particularly severe problem for the estimated 11 million food-insecure children, living in the United States.\n\nPhysical Activity\nWhen schools are closed, children lose access to important opportunities for physical activity.  Many children may not be sufficiently physically active outside of the context of in-school physical education (PE) and other school-based activities.  Beyond PE, with schools closed, children may not have sufficient opportunities to participate in organized and safe physical activity.  They also lose access to other school-based physical activities, including recess, classroom engagements, and after school programs.\n\nThe loss of opportunities for physical activity from school closures, especially when coupled with potentially diminished nutrition, can be particularly harmful to children.  Physical inactivity and poor nutrition among children are major risk factors for childhood obesity and other chronic health conditions.  Over 75 percent of children and adolescents in the United States do not meet the daily physical activity level recommendations (60 minutes or more), and nearly half exceed 2 hours per day in sedentary behavior.  Current models estimate that childhood obesity rate may increase by 2.4 percent if school closures continue to December 2020.[37],[38],[39]\n\nConclusion\nSchools are an important part of the infrastructure of our communities, as they provide safe, supportive learning environments for students, employ teachers and other staff, and enable parents, guardians, and caregivers to work.  Schools also provide critical services that help meet the needs of children and families, especially those who are disadvantaged, through supporting the development of social and emotional skills, creating a safe environment for learning, identifying and addressing neglect and abuse, fulfilling nutritional needs, and facilitating physical activity.  School closure disrupts the delivery of in-person instruction and critical services to children and families, which has negative individual and societal ramifications.  The best available evidence from countries that have opened schools indicates that COVID-19 poses low risks to school-aged children, at least in areas with low community transmission, and suggests that children are unlikely to be major drivers of the spread of the virus.  Reopening schools creates opportunity to invest in the education, well-being, and future of one of America\u2019s greatest assets\u2014our children\u2014while taking every precaution to protect students, teachers, staff and all their families.",

Working with local health officials and with parents and caregivers, schools also have an important role in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) while protecting students, teachers, and staff and helping ensure students have safe and healthy learning environments.\n\nAs schools begin to reopen across the nation, parents, guardians, and caregivers will be making decisions based on numerous factors, such as individual preferences, health concerns, work situations, and school considerations. When making decisions about school for your family, there are many things to think about beyond academics, such as access to school meal programs, social services, extended day childcare, extra-curricular activities, social-emotional support from peers and educators, and transportation. Parents, guardians, and caregivers will be thinking about numerous factors, such as individual preferences, health concerns, work situations, and school considerations.\n\nMany schools are offering parents and guardians a choice between in-person and virtual modes of instruction. CDC\u2019s Decision-Making Tool for Parents and Guardians is designed to help you think through school re-entry and the choices that your child\u2019s school is offering. \u200b\n\nConsider the risks and benefits\nBecause of the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE), instructional formats such as class size, setting, and daily schedules will likely look different than in past years. Consider the risks and benefits of these different instructional formats. For example, in-person instruction may offer easier access to school services, improved educational efficacy, more opportunities for social interaction and return to work for some parents and caregivers, but it also has a higher risk of COVID-19 exposure for your child than virtual instruction. Families will differ in their choice of instructional formats based on whether  the student or members of the household are at increased risk of severe illness, the student\u2019s academic needs, the level of COVID-19 spread in the community, available school transportation options, school ability to execute recommended guidelines, the student\u2019s social-emotional wellbeing, comfort and familiarity with the school\u2019s reopening plans, and the family\u2019s situation and needs.\n\nAs you are making decisions about your child(ren) returning to school, it is important to consider the full spectrum of risks involved in both in-person and virtual learning options. Parents, guardians, and caregivers should weigh the relative health risks of COVID-19 transmission from in-personal instruction against the educational, social-behavioral, and emotional risks of providing no in-person instruction when deciding between these two options. Aside from a child\u2019s home, no other setting has more influence on a child\u2019s health and well-being than the school. The in-person school environment not only provides educational instruction, but supports a child\u2019s social and emotional skills, safety, speech, mental health, reliable nutrition, and opportunities for physical activity. This tool is designed to help weigh the risks and benefits of available educational options to help you make decisions about sending your child back to school.\n\nCOVID-19 and children: what we know\nCOVID-19 is a newly identified disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. Scientists are still learning about how it spreads, how it affects children, and what role children may play in its spread. Limited data about COVID-19 in children suggest that children are less likely to get COVID-19 than adults, and when they do get COVID-19, they generally have less serious illness than adults [1]. Common symptoms of COVID-19 among children include fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, headache, body ache, and diarrhea; many children may have mild or no symptoms [1]. As of July 21, 2020, 6.6% of reported COVID-19 cases and <0.1% of COVID-19-related deaths are among children and adolescents less than 18 years of age in the United States [2]. While uncommon, deaths and rare illness such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) may occur [3].\n\nEvidence and information about transmission (the way germs move from person to person) of COVID-19 to children is relatively limited. Evidence from other countries suggest that most pediatric cases resulted from children becoming infected by a family member [4]. The more individuals a person interacts with, and the longer the interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. The risk of getting COVID-19 is also influenced by the intensity of transmission in your community. Your State, local, Tribal, or territorial health department website should provide information about the spread of COVID-19 in your area.\n\nChildren at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19\nSome children may be at increased risk of getting COVID-19 or may be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.  For these children, parents and caregivers may need to take additional precautions with regard to school re-entry. There are more COVID-19 cases reported among children with intellectual and developmental disabilities than those without [5]. People of any age, including children, with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Additionally, children who are medically complex, who have neurologic, genetic, metabolic conditions, or who have congenital heart disease might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, compared to other children. Severe illness means that they may require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe, or may even die.\n\nHousehold members and caregivers at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19\nWhile there is no way to ensure zero risk of infection, it is important to understand potential risks and how to adopt different types of prevention measures when resuming activities, including returning to school. Parents and guardians should consider whether other household members are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 when making decisions about which activities to resume.\n\nIn addition, long-standing systemic health and social inequities have put some groups at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 or experiencing severe illness, including some members of racial and ethnic minority groups, and individuals experiencing homelessness.\n\nIf you, your child, or a household member are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, you will need to weigh the benefits, risks, and feasibility of the educational options available. The table below will help you to assess your risk for COVID-19.\n\nHousehold and community risks for COVID-19\nIn this section, a \u201cTrue\u201d response indicates higher risk for COVID-19.\n\n\n\nHousehold and Community Risks for COVID-19.In this section, a \u201cTrue\u201d response indicates higher risk for COVID-19\nDoes Not Apply\tFalse\tUnsure\tTrue (High Risk)\nMy child has an underlying condition that increases the risk for severe illness from COVID-19.\t\t\t\t\nI live with someone, or my child\u2019s caregiver, is at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 due to age or underlying medical conditions.\t\t\t\t\nThe level of community spread in my area is high.\t\t\t\t\nCritical role of schools\nCOVID-19 transmission and illness are not the only risks to consider when making decisions about sending children back to school. Schools provide important services and supports for children\u2019s academic, social-emotional and physical health. For instance, social interaction among children in grades K-12 is important not only for emotional wellbeing, but also for children\u2019s language, communication, social, and interpersonal skills [6]. Some students may have experienced social isolation and increased anxiety while not physically being in school due to COVID-19.\n\nSchools also provide critical services, such as school meal programs and behavioral and mental health services. Continuity of other special services is important for student success and lack of access to these services and supports have the potential to widen existing disparities and cause long-term effects on children\u2019s educational outcomes, health, and the economic wellbeing of families and communities.\n\nReview your school\u2019s plans to reduce risk\nReview local school or school district reopening plans to understand the steps they are taking to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and support educational goals.\n\nSchools can implement strategies across 4 key areas to reduce the spread of COVID-19:\n\nPromoting behaviors that reduce spread (e.g., social distancing, washing hands and wearing cloth face coverings)\nMaintaining healthy environments (e.g., ensuring proper ventilation, cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces)\nMaintaining healthy operations (e.g., staggering schedules, keeping students in small groups)\nPreparing for when someone gets sick\nSchools in communities with higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 will likely take more steps to prevent the spread of disease. See CDC\u2019s Considerations for Schools for examples of some steps schools may take as part of their reopening strategy. Parents and caregivers might also be interested in learning how the school plans to support the emotional wellbeing of students\u2014both in person and virtually.\n\nSchools can work with state, local, territorial, and tribal health officials to determine whether and how to implement these considerations to meet the unique needs and circumstances of the local community. Implementation should be guided by what is feasible, practical, acceptable, and tailored to the needs of each community.\n\nDecision-making tool for parents and guardians\nChoosing whether or not to send your child back to school can be difficult. When weighing decisions about your child returning to school, it is important to consider your family\u2019s unique needs and situation and your comfort level with the steps your school is taking to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Some considerations may include the specific risks to members of your household if a child were to become infected in school, as well as access to school meal programs, social services, extended day childcare services and extra-curricular activities, social-emotional support from peers and educators, and school transportation.\n\nThe questions in these tools are designed to help you weigh the risks and benefits of available educational options before you make decisions. Recognizing that there may be many unknowns, answer each question with a check in the column that most closely reflects you and your family today. When you are finished, review your answers. Remember, each family is different so certain questions may be particularly important to you. Multiple checks in the \u201cUnsure\u201d or \u201cDisagree\u201d columns might warrant a conversation with school administrators, your healthcare provider, or your employer. Parents may also want to use the tool to make their views, concerns, and suggestions known to school administrators.\n\nIf your child or a member of your family has been diagnosed with COVID-19, please follow CDC\u2019s guidelines and stay at home until the criteria to discontinue home isolation have been met.",

Here\u2019s what we currently know:\n\nThe main way the virus spreads is from person to person through respiratory droplets.\nYou may also be able to get it by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching your face, mouth, nose, or eyes.\nCOVID-19 may be spread by people who are not experiencing symptoms. COVID-19 can sometimes cause serious complications. People at increased risk for severe illness include:\n\nOlder adults\nPeople of any age who have underlying medical conditions\nAs an employer of public health inspectors your workforce might come into contact with the virus by:\n\nBeing in close contact (within about 6 feet) with other people, which can include coworkers, the employees of the facility being inspected, and the public) at the office, during travel, or during inspections.\nTouching or handling high-contact surfaces and equipment, and then touching their face, mouth, nose, or eyes.\nInvestigating facilities where COVID-19 transmission is occurring or has occurred, such as healthcare facilities.\nHow you can protect your staff and others and slow the spread\nEvaluate your work practices to identify scenarios where workers cannot maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet from each other and/or the public. Use appropriate combinations of controls following the hierarchy of controls to address these situations to limit the spread of COVID-19. A committee of both workers and management may be most effective at recognizing all scenarios.\n\nWhile protecting workers, it is important to note that control recommendations or interventions to reduce risk to COVID-19 must be compatible with any safety programs and personal protective equipment (PPE) normally required for the job task. Approaches to consider may include the following:\n\nCreate a COVID-19 Workplace Health and Safety Plan\n\nReview the CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers and the Resuming Business Toolkit for guidelines and recommendations that all employers can use to protect their employees.\n\nIdentify an on-site workplace coordinator who will be responsible for COVID-19 assessment and control.\nInclude representatives of each type of employee in providing input on the COVID-19 workplace health and safety plan. For example, include professional, utility, relief, janitorial, maintenance, administrative, and supervisory staff in the planning.\nIf service personnel and/or the public enter the workplace, develop plans to communicate with them regarding modification to work procedures.\nConsider off-site field work and travel in the COVID-19 workplace health and safety plan, such as what equipment and materials may be needed to protect public health inspectors during routine inspections and multi-day travel, which could include driving long distances, flying, and staying in overnight lodging. Include public health inspectors and their supervisors, travel preparers, and motor-pool workers in this planning.\nNotify all workers that any COVID-19 concerns should be directed to the identified coordinator.\nImplement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices.\nDevelop policies that encourage sick employees to stay at home without fear of reprisals, and ensure employees are aware of these policies.\nIf contractors are employed in the workplace, develop plans to communicate with the contracting company regarding modifications to work processes.\nConsider conducting daily in-person or virtual health checks (e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening) of employees as they report to work.\nScreening options could include having employees self-screen prior to arriving at work or having on-site screening by taking an employee\u2019s temperature and assessing potential symptoms prior to traveling or reporting to worksites for inspections (see CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers).\nMake sure employees can maintain at least 6 feet of distance while waiting for screening.\nDetermine what state and local regulations apply to the locations and facilities being inspected and identify the point of contact for COVID-19 precautions at those facilities. As part of your organization\u2019s COVID-19 workplace health and safety plan, train and equip inspectors to comply with any regulations and infection control protocols in place at the facilities being inspected, if they are at least as protective as your organization\u2019s established infection control protocols.\nTake action if an employee is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 infection\n\nImmediately separate employees who report with or develop symptoms at work from other employees and arrange for private transport home. These employees should self-isolate and contact their health care provider immediately.\nClose off any areas used for prolonged periods of time by the sick person.\nPerform cleaning and disinfection after anyone suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 has been in the workplace. Cleaning staff should clean and disinfect offices, bathrooms, common areas, and shared electronic equipment used by the ill persons, focusing especially on frequently touched surfaces. If other workers do not have access to these areas or items, wait 24 hours (or as long as possible) before cleaning and disinfecting. If it has been more than seven days since the person with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 has been in the workplace, additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary.\nEmployees who test positive for COVID-19 should immediately notify their employer of their results.\nSick employees should follow CDC recommended steps to self-isolate or seek care. Employees should not return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, in consultation with healthcare providers.\nDevelop hazard controls using the hierarchy of controls to prevent infection among workers. You may be able to include a combination of controls noted below.\n\nEngineering Controls (Isolate people from the hazards)\nAlter the workspace using engineering controls to prevent exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nModify the alignment of workstations where feasible. For example, redesign workstations so workers are not facing each other.\nClose or limit access to common areas where employees are likely to congregate and interact, such as break rooms, parking lots, and entrance/exit areas.\nConsider making foot-traffic single direction in narrow or confined areas, such as aisles and stairwells, to encourage single-file movement at a 6-foot distance.\nUse visual cues such as floor decals, colored tape, and signs to remind workers to maintain distance of 6 feet from others, including at their workstation and in break areas.\nPlace handwashing stations or hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol in multiple locations throughout the workplace for workers and customers.\nUse touch-free stations where possible.\nMake sure restrooms are well stocked with soap and paper towels.\nMake sure the workspace is well ventilatedexternal icon.\nIf the permanent offices or workspaces have special ventilation (such as ventilated tables or portable ventilation units), they should be used.\nWork with facilities management to adjust the ventilation so that the maximum amount of fresh air is delivered to occupied spaces while maintaining the humidity at 40-60%. If possible, increase filter efficiency of HVAC units to highest functional level.\nPortable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration units may be considered to remove contaminants in the air of poorly ventilated areas.\nAdditional considerations for improving the building ventilation system can be found in the CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers.\nAdministrative Controls (Change the way people work)\nProvide training and other administrative policies to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nAll workers should have a basic understanding of COVID-19, how the disease is thought to spread (including spread by asymptomatic individuals), what the symptoms of the disease are, and what measures can be taken to prevent or minimize the transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19.\nTrainings should include the importance of social distancing (maintaining a distance of 6 feet or more when possible), wearing cloth face coverings appropriately, covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands, cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, not sharing personal items or tools/equipment unless absolutely necessary, not touching their face, mouth, nose, or eyes, and the importance of not coming to work when sick.\nTraining and other communications should be easy to understand, in preferred language(s) spoken or read by the employees and include accurate and timely information.\nEmphasize use of images (infographics) that account for language differences.\nConsider maintaining small groups of workers in teams (cohorting) to reduce the number of coworkers each person is exposed to.\nIf possible, collect information on COVID-19 precautions in use at the facilities to be inspected, even if it means pre-announcing these inspections.\nImplement specific policies that minimize travel or face-to-face interactions for inspectors.\nAssign inspectors to facilities that limit the distance traveled and need for overnight lodging.\nProvide technological support for conducting elements of inspections virtually, such as record reviews and employer and employee interviews.\nConsult CDC travel guidance on additional precautions that can be taken if inspectors must travel and stay overnight.\nClean and Disinfect frequently touched surfaces.\nIf surfaces are dirty, clean them using a detergent or soap and water before you disinfect them.\nUse products that are EPA-registeredexternal icon, diluted household bleach solutions, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, appropriate for surface disinfection.\nProvide sanitizing disposable wipes for inspectors to have on hand when they are in the field. These can be used to clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces or items used during the inspection (e.g., desks, clipboards, pens, cameras, cell phones, laptops, keyboards, etc.). Do not share materials such as clip boards, pens, or touchscreens if possible.\nProvide employees adequate time and access to soap, clean water, and single use paper towels for handwashing.\nRemind employees to wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, they should use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.\nProvide hand sanitizer to inspectors for use in the field.\nMaintain physical distancing of at least 6 feet in offices or workspaces and while inspectors are in the field. This may require limiting the number of people in offices or workspaces at one time. (Consult state and local guidance if available.)\nPost signs and reminders at workplace entrances and in strategic places providing instruction on social distancing, hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette. Signs should be accessible for people with disabilities, easy to understand (preferably including infographics), and may include signs for non-English speakers, as needed. CDC has free, simple posters available to download and print, some of which are translated into different languages.\nEncourage or require cloth face coverings in the workplace and field as appropriate.\nCloth face coverings are intended to protect other people\u2014not the wearer. They are not considered PPE.\nEmphasize that care must be taken when putting on and taking off cloth face coverings to ensure that the worker or the cloth face covering does not become contaminated. Hand hygiene should be conducted after removing cloth face coverings.\nCloth face coverings should be routinely laundered.\nCloth face coverings should not be worn if their use creates a new risk (i.e. interference with driving or vision, or contributions to heat related illness) that exceeds their COVID-19 related benefits of slowing the spread of the virus. Cloth face coverings should also not be worn by anyone who has trouble breathing or is unable to remove the covering without assistance. CDC provides information on adaptations and alternatives that should be considered when cloth face coverings may not be feasible.\nConsider requiring visitors to the workplace (service personnel or the public) to also wear cloth face coverings.\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE)\nPPE is the last step in the hierarchy of controls because it is more difficult to use effectively than other measures. To be protective and not introduce an additional hazard, the use of PPE requires characterization of the environment, knowledge of the hazard, training, and consistent correct use. This is why special emphasis is given to administrative and engineering controls when addressing occupational hazards, including when applying guidance to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIn the current COVID-19 pandemic, use of PPE such as surgical masks or N95 respirators is being prioritized for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance. If inspections are occurring in a location with known COVID-19 patients (such as a healthcare facility) see the Infection Control Guidance for Healthcare Professionals about Coronavirus for more information on PPE.",

Additional information about isolation in related settings can be found here: isolation at home and isolation in healthcare settings.\nBe ready to follow CDC guidance on how to disinfect your building or facility if someone is sick.\nIf a sick child has been isolated in your facility, clean and disinfect surfaces in your isolation room or area after the sick child has gone home.\nIf COVID-19 is confirmed in a child or staff member:\nClose off areas used by the person who is sick.\nOpen outside doors and windows to increase air circulation in the areas.\nWait up to 24 hours or as long as possible before you clean or disinfect to allow respiratory droplets to settle before cleaning and disinfecting.\nClean and disinfect all areas used by the person who is sick, such as offices, bathrooms, and common areas.\nIf more than 7 days have passed since the person who is sick visited or used the facility, additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary.\nContinue routine cleaning and disinfection.\nMonitor and Plan for Absenteeism Among Your Staff\nDevelop plans to cover classes in the event of increased staff absences. Coordinate with other local child care programs and reach out to substitutes to determine their anticipated availability if regular staff members need to stay home if they or their family members are sick.\nRecommend that people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 (older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions) consult with their medical provider to assess their risk and to determine if they should stay home if there is an outbreak in their community.\nReview plans for implementing social distancing strategies\nSocial distancing focuses on remaining out of congregate settings, avoiding mass gatherings, and maintaining distance from others when possible. Detailed guidance for implementing social distancing strategies in child care centers and schools is found here: Social Distancing Strategies\nAssess Group Gatherings and Events\nFollow current guidance about gatherings and events.\nPlan to limit nonessential visitors and postpone or cancel use of classroom volunteers.\nIf Your Child Care Program Remains Open\nChild care programs that remain open during the COVID-19 pandemic should address these additional considerations:\n\nImplement social distancing strategies\nIntensify cleaning and disinfection efforts\nModify drop off and pick up procedures\nImplement screening procedures up arrival\nMaintain an adequate ratio of staff to children to ensure safety.\nPlan ahead and recruit those with child care experience to ensure you have a roster of substitute caregivers who can fill in if your staff members are sick or stay home to care for sick family members.\nWhen feasible, staff members and older children should wear masks within the facility. Masks should NOT be put on babies and children under age two because of the danger of suffocation.\nSome schools, child care programs, and service organizations are supporting their communities by providing temporary or emergency child care services for the children of essential service providers such as first responders, healthcare workers, transit or food retail workers, and persons who do not have paid leave, cannot work from home, or do not have a family caregiver at home.\n\nIf you re-purpose your school or service facility as an emergency or temporary child care center, please follow CDC guidance for administrators of child care programs and K-12 schools.\nBe sure to follow state and local child care licensing policies and regulationsexternal icon. Specifically, all facilities should continue to adhere to their state and local licensing policies unless otherwise notified by their local health department.\nGuidance may also be provided by the department of education and/or health department in your state, city, or locality.\nSocial Distancing Strategies\nWork with your local health officials to determine a set of strategies appropriate for your community\u2019s situation. Continue using preparedness strategies and consider the following social distancing strategies:\n\nIf possible, child care classes should include the same group each day, and the same child care providers should remain with the same group each day. If your child care program remains open, consider creating a separate classroom or group for the children of healthcare workers and other first responders. If your program is unable to create a separate classroom, consider serving only the children of healthcare workers and first responders.\nCancel or postpone special events such as festivals, holiday events, and special performances.\nConsider whether to alter or halt daily group activities that may promote transmission.\nKeep each group of children in a separate room.\nLimit the mixing of children, such as staggering playground times and keeping groups separate for special activities such as art, music, and exercising.\nIf possible, at nap time, ensure that children\u2019s naptime mats (or cribs) are spaced out as much as possible, ideally 6 feet apart. Consider placing children head to toe in order to further reduce the potential for viral spread.\nConsider staggering arrival and drop off times and/or have child care providers come outside the facility to pick up the children as they arrive. Your plan for curb side drop off and pick up should limit direct contact between parents and staff members and adhere to social distancing recommendations.\nIf possible, arrange for administrative staff to telework from their homes.\nParent Drop-Off and Pick-Up\nHand hygiene stations should be set up at the entrance of the facility, so that children can clean their hands before they enter. If a sink with soap and water is not available, provide hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol next to parent sign-in sheets. Keep hand sanitizer out of children\u2019s reach and supervise use. If possible, place sign-in stations outside, and provide sanitary wipes for cleaning pens between each use.\nConsider staggering arrival and drop off times and plan to limit direct contact with parents as much as possible.\nHave child care providers greet children outside as they arrive.\nDesignate a parent to be the drop off/pick up volunteer to walk all children to their classroom, and at the end of the day, walk all children back to their cars.\nInfants could be transported in their car seats. Store car seat out of children\u2019s reach.\nIdeally, the same parent or designated person should drop off and pick up the child every day. If possible, older people such as grandparents or those with serious underlying medical conditions should not pick up children, because they are more at risk for severe illness from COVID-19.\nScreen Children Upon Arrival (if possible )\nPersons who have a fever of 100.40 (38.00C) or above or other signs of illness should not be admitted to the facility. Encourage parents to be on the alert for signs of illness in their children and to keep them home when they are sick. Screen children upon arrival, if possible.\n\nThere are several methods that facilities can use to protect their workers while conducting temperature screenings. The most protective methods incorporate social distancing (maintaining a distance of 6 feet from others) or physical barriers to eliminate or minimize exposures due to close contact to a child who has symptoms during screening.\n\nExamples of Screening Methods\nReliance on Social Distancing (example 1 )\nAsk parents/guardians to take their child\u2019s temperature either before coming to the facility or upon arrival at the facility. Upon their arrival, stand at least 6 feet away from the parent/guardian and child.\nAsk the parent/guardian to confirm that the child does not have fever, shortness of breath or cough.\nMake a visual inspection of the child for signs of illness which could include flushed cheeks, rapid breathing or difficulty breathing (without recent physical activity), fatigue, or extreme fussiness.\nYou do not need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) if you can maintain a distance of 6 feet.\n\nReliance on Barrier/Partition Controls (example 2 )\nStand behind a physical barrier, such as a glass or plastic window or partition that can serve to protect the staff member\u2019s face and mucous membranes from respiratory droplets that may be produced if the child being screened sneezes, coughs, or talks.\nMake a visual inspection of the child for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks, rapid breathing or difficulty breathing (without recent physical activity), fatigue, or extreme fussiness.\nConduct temperature screening (follow steps below)\nPerform hand hygiene\nWash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.\nPut on disposable gloves.\nCheck the child\u2019s temperature, reaching around the partition or through the window.\nMake sure your face stays behind the barrier at all times during the screening.\nIf performing a temperature check on multiple individuals, ensure that you use a clean pair of gloves for each child and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned in between each check.\nIf you use disposable or non-contact (temporal) thermometers and you did not have physical contact with the child, you do not need to change gloves before the next check.\nIf you use non-contact thermometers, clean them with an alcohol wipe (or isopropyl alcohol on a cotton swab) between each client. You can reuse the same wipe as long as it remains wet.\nReliance on Personal Protective Equipment (example 3 )\nIf social distancing or barrier/partition controls cannot be implemented during screening, personal protective equipment (PPE) can be used when within 6 feet of a child. However, reliance on PPE alone is a less effective control and more difficult to implement, given PPE shortages and training requirements.\n\nUpon arrival, wash your hands and put on a facemask, eye protection (goggles or disposable face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face), and a single pair of disposable gloves. A gown could be considered if extensive contact with a child is anticipated.\nMake a visual inspection of the child for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks, rapid breathing or difficulty breathing (without recent physical activity), fatigue, or extreme fussiness, and confirm that the child is not experiencing coughing or shortness of breath.\nTake the child\u2019s temperature.\nIf performing a temperature check on multiple individuals, ensure that you use a clean pair of gloves for each child and that the thermometer has been thoroughly cleaned in between each check.\nIf you use disposable or non-contact (temporal) thermometers and did not have physical contact with an individual, you do not need to change gloves before the next check.\nIf you use non-contact thermometers, clean them with an alcohol wipe (or isopropyl alcohol on a cotton swab) between each client. You can reuse the same wipe as long as it remains wet.\nAfter each screening, remove and discard PPE, and wash hands.\nUse an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol or wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\nIf hands are visibly soiled, soap and water should be used before using alcohol-based hand sanitizer.\nIf your staff does not have experience in using PPE:\nCheck to see if your facility has guidance on how to don and doff PPE. The procedure to don and doff should be tailored to the specific type of PPE that you have available at your facility.\nIf your facility does not have specific guidance, the CDC has recommended sequences for donning and doffing PPEpdf icon.\nClean and Disinfect\nCaring for Our Childrenexternal icon (CFOC) provides national standards for cleaning, sanitizing and disinfection of educational facilities for children. Toys that can be put in the mouth should be cleaned and sanitized (see below). Other hard surfaces, including diaper changing stations, door knobs, and floors can be disinfected.\n\nIntensify cleaning and disinfection efforts:\n\nFacilities should develop a schedule for cleaning and disinfecting. An example can be found herepdf iconexternal icon.\nRoutinely clean, sanitize, and disinfect surfaces and objects that are frequently touched, especially toys and games. This may also include cleaning objects/surfaces not ordinarily cleaned daily such as doorknobs, light switches, classroom sink handles, countertops, nap pads, toilet training potties, desks, chairs, cubbies, and playground structures. Use the cleaners typically used at your facility. Guidance is available for the selection of appropriate sanitizers or disinfectantspdf iconexternal icon for child care settings.\nUse all cleaning products according to the directions on the label. For disinfection, most common EPA-registered, fragrance-free household disinfectants should be effective. A list of products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19 is available hereexternal icon. If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for concentration, application method, and contact time for all cleaning and disinfection products.\nIf possible, provide EPA-registered disposable wipes to child care providers and other staff members so that commonly used surfaces such as keyboards, desks, and remote controls can be wiped down before use. If wipes are not available, please refer to CDC\u2019s guidance on disinfection for community settings.\nAll cleaning materials should be kept secure and out of reach of children.\nCleaning products should not be used near children, and staff should ensure that there is adequate ventilation when using these products to prevent children from inhaling toxic fumes.\nClean and Sanitize Toys\nCleaning toys video thumbnail\nTips for cleaning toys\n\nToys that cannot be cleaned and sanitized should not be used.\nToys that children have placed in their mouths or that are otherwise contaminated by body secretions or excretions should be set aside until they are cleaned by hand by a person wearing gloves. Clean with water and detergent, rinse, sanitize with an EPA-registered disinfectant, rinse again, and air-dry. You may also clean in a mechanical dishwasher. Be mindful of items more likely to be placed in a child\u2019s mouth, like play food, dishes, and utensils.\nMachine washable cloth toys should be used by one individual at a time or should not be used at all. These toys should be laundered before being used by another child.\nDo not share toys with other groups of infants or toddlers, unless they are washed and sanitized before being moved from one group to the other.\nSet aside toys that need to be cleaned. Place in a dish pan with soapy water or put in a separate container marked for \u201csoiled toys.\u201d Keep dish pan and water out of reach from children to prevent risk of drowning. Washing with soapy water is the ideal method for cleaning. Try to have enough toys so that the toys can be rotated through cleanings.\nChildren\u2019s books, like other paper-based materials such as mail or envelopes, are not considered a high risk for transmission and do not need additional cleaning or disinfection procedures.\nClean and Disinfect Bedding\nUse bedding (sheets, pillows, blankets, sleeping bags) that can be washed. Keep each child\u2019s bedding separate, and consider storing in individually labeled bins, cubbies, or bags. Cots and mats should be labeled for each child. Bedding that touches a child\u2019s skin should be cleaned weekly or before use by another child.\nCaring for Infants and Toddlers\nDiapering\nWhen diaperingexternal icon a child, wash your hands and wash the child\u2019s hands before you begin, and wear gloves. Follow safe diaper changing procedures. Procedures should be posted in all diaper changing areas. Steps include:\n\nPrepare (includes putting on gloves)\nClean the child\nRemove trash (soiled diaper and wipes)\nReplace diaper\nWash child\u2019s hands\nClean up diapering station\nWash hands\nAfter diapering, wash your hands (even if you were wearing gloves) and disinfect the diapering area with a fragrance-free bleach that is EPA-registered as a sanitizing or disinfecting solution. If other products are used for sanitizing or disinfecting, they should also be fragrance-free and EPA-registered. If the surface is dirty, it should be cleaned with detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.\n\nIf reusable cloth diapers are used, they should not be rinsed or cleaned in the facility. The soiled cloth diaper and its contents (without emptying or rinsing) should be placed in a plastic bag or into a plastic-lined, hands-free covered diaper pail to give to parents/guardians or laundry service.\n\nDownload posters with diaper changing procedures.\n\nWashing, Feeding, or Holding a Child\nIt is important to comfort crying, sad, and/or anxious infants and toddlers, and they often need to be held. To the extent possible, when washing, feeding, or holding very young children: Child care providers can protect themselves by wearing an over-large button-down, long sleeved shirt and by wearing long hair up off the collar in a ponytail or other updo.\n\nChild care providers should wash their hands, neck, and anywhere touched by a child\u2019s secretions.\nChild care providers should change the child\u2019s clothes if secretions are on the child\u2019s clothes. They should change the button-down shirt, if there are secretions on it, and wash their hands again.\nContaminated clothes should be placed in a plastic bag or washed in a washing machine.\nInfants, toddlers, and their providers should have multiple changes of clothes on hand in the child care center or home-based child care.\nChild care providers should wash their hands before and after handling infant bottles prepared at home or prepared in the facility. Bottles, bottle caps, nipples, and other equipment used for bottle-feeding should be thoroughly cleaned after each use by washing in a dishwasher or by washing with a bottlebrush, soap, and water.\nSchool nurses in schools that have been re-purposed as emergency or temporary child care centers should use Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions when caring for patients with confirmed or possible COVID-19. See: What Healthcare Personnel Should Know about Caring for Patients with Confirmed or Possible COVID-19 Infection.\n\nHealthy Hand Hygiene Behavior\nAll children, staff, and volunteers should engage in hand hygiene at the following times:\nArrival to the facility and after breaks\nBefore and after preparing food or drinks\nBefore and after eating or handling food, or feeding children\nBefore and after administering medication or medical ointment\nBefore and after diapering\nAfter using the toilet or helping a child use the bathroom\nAfter coming in contact with bodily fluid\nAfter handling animals or cleaning up animal waste\nAfter playing outdoors or in sand\nAfter handling garbage\nWash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If hands are not visibly dirty, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol can be used if soap and water are not readily available.\nSupervise children when they use hand sanitizer to prevent ingestion.\nAssist children with handwashing, including infants who cannot wash hands alone.\nAfter assisting children with handwashing, staff should also wash their hands.\nPlace posters describing handwashing steps near sinks. Developmentally appropriate posters in multiple languages are available from CDC.\nFood Preparation and Meal Service\nIf a cafeteria or group dining room is typically used, serve meals in classrooms instead. If meals are typically served family-style, plate each child\u2019s meal to serve it so that multiple children are not using the same serving utensils.\nFood preparation should not be done by the same staff who diaper children.\nSinks used for food preparation should not be used for any other purposes.\nCaregivers should ensure children wash hands prior to and immediately after eating.\nCaregivers should wash their hands before preparing food and after helping children to eat.\nFacilities should follow all other applicable federal, state, and local regulations and guidanceexternal icon related to safe preparation of food.\n\nVulnerable/High Risk Groups\nBased on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. To protect those at higher risk, it\u2019s important that everyone practices healthy hygiene behaviors.\n\nIf you have staff members or teachers age 65 or older, or with serious underlying health conditions, encourage them to talk to their healthcare provider to assess their risk and to determine if they should stay home.\nInformation about COVID-19 in children is somewhat limited, but the information that is available suggests that many children have mild symptoms. However, a small percentage of children have been reported to have more severe illness. If you have children with underlying health conditions, talk to their parents about their risk. Follow children\u2019s care plans for underlying health conditions such as an asthma action plan.\nIf you have children with disabilities, talk to their parents about how their children can continue to receive the support they need.",

            "Text": "Purpose\nThe purpose of this document is to provide employers with strategies for consideration of incorporating testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, into a workplace COVID-19 preparedness, response, and control plan.\n\nEmployers are encouraged to collaborate with state, territorial, tribal and local health officials to determine whether and how to implement the following testing strategies and which one(s) would be most appropriate for their circumstances. These considerations are meant to supplement, not replace, any federal, state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which workplaces must comply. These strategies should be carried out in a manner consistent with law and regulation, including laws protecting employee privacy and confidentiality. They should also be carried out consistent with Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidance regarding permissible testing policies and procedures. Employers paying for testing of employees should put procedures in place for rapid notification of results and establish appropriate measures based on testing results including instructions regarding self-isolation and restrictions on workplace access.\n\nConsiderations for use of a strategy to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection\nSARS-CoV-2 testing may be incorporated as part of a comprehensive approach to reducing transmission in non-healthcare workplaces. Symptom screening, testing, and contact tracing pdf icon[58 pages] are strategies to identify workers infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, so that actions can be taken to slow and stop the spread of the virus.\n\nEmployees undergoing testing should receive clear information on:\n\nthe manufacturer and name of the test, the type of test, the purpose of the test, the reliability of the test, any limitations associated with the test, who will pay for the test, and how the test will be performed, and\nhow to understand what the results mean, actions associated with negative or positive results, who will receive the results, how the results may be used, and any consequences for declining to be tested.\nIndividuals tested are required to receive patient fact sheets as part of the test\u2019s emergency use authorizationexternal icon.\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration has issued interim guidanceexternal icon for enforcing the requirements of 29 CFR Part 1904external icon with respect to the recording of occupational illnesses, specifically cases of COVID-19. Under OSHA\u2019s recordkeeping requirements, COVID-19 is a recordable illness, and thus employers are responsible for recording cases of COVID-19, if the case meets certain requirements. Employers are encouraged to frequently check OSHA\u2019s webpage at www.osha.gov/coronavirusexternal icon for updates.\n\nTesting for SARS-CoV-2 infection\nViral tests approved or authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are used to diagnose current infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Viral tests evaluate whether the virus is present in respiratory or other samples. Results from these tests help public health officials identify and isolate people who are infected in order to minimize SARS-CoV-2 transmission.\n\nAntibody tests approved or authorized by the FDA are used to detect past infection with SARS-CoV-2. CDC does not currently recommend using antibody testing as the sole basis for diagnosing current infection. Depending on when someone was infected and the timing of the test, the test may not find antibodies in someone with a current SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, it is currently not known whether a positive antibody test indicates immunity against SARS-CoV-2; therefore, antibody tests should not be used at this time to determine if an individual is immune.\n\nCategories for SARS-CoV-2 testing\nCDC describes strategies for SARS-CoV-2 viral testing for five categories of people:\n\nTesting individuals with signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19\nTesting asymptomatic individuals with recent known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 to control transmission\nTesting asymptomatic individuals without known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 for early identification in special settings\nTesting to determine resolution of infection (e.g., discontinuation of home isolation)\nPublic health surveillance for SARS-CoV-2\nTesting individuals with signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19\nEmployers may consider conducting daily in-person or virtual health checks (e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening) to identify employees with signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19 before they enter a facility, in accordance with CDC\u2019s General Business FAQs. Employers should follow guidance from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commissionexternal icon regarding confidentiality of medical records from health checks.\n\nWorkers with COVID-19 symptoms should be immediately separated from other employees, customers, and visitors, and sent home or to a healthcare facility, depending on how severe their symptoms are, and follow CDC guidance for caring for oneself. To prevent stigma and discrimination in the workplace, make employee health screenings as private as possible. Consistent with CDC\u2019s recommendations, workers with COVID-19 symptoms should be referred to a healthcare provider for evaluation and potential testing. Waiting for test results prior to returning to work is preferred to keep potentially infected workers out of the workplace.\n\nEmployers are encouraged to implement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices as part of a comprehensive approach to prevent and reduce transmission among employees. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA or Act) requires certain employersexternal icon to provide their employees with paid sick leave or expanded family and medical leave for specified reasons related to COVID-19. Employers with fewer than 500 employees are eligible for 100% tax creditsexternal icon for Families First Coronavirus Response Act COVID-19 paid leave provided through December 31, 2020, up to certain limits.\n\nPositive test results using a viral test indicate that the employee has COVID-19 and should not come to work and should isolate at home. Decisions to discontinue home isolation for workers with COVID-19 and allow them to return to work may follow either a symptom-based, time based, or a test-based strategy (see Testing to determine resolution of infection below).\n\nTesting asymptomatic individuals with recent known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 to control transmission\nCase investigation is typically initiated when a health department receives a report from a laboratory of a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral test result or a report from a healthcare provider of a patient with a confirmed or probable diagnosis of COVID-19pdf iconexternal icon.\n\nViral testing may be recommended for close contacts of persons with COVID-19 in jurisdictions with testing capacity. Because of the potential for asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2, it is important that individuals exposed to people with known or suspected COVID-19 be quickly identified and quarantined. Viral testing can detect if these individuals are currently infected. The health department may reach out to the employer for assistance in identifying close contacts of the worker as well as possible contacts. Employers are encouraged to work with public health departments investigating cases of COVID-19 and tracing contacts to help reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in their workplaces and communities.\n\nBecause there may be a delay between the time a person is exposed to the virus and the time that virus can be detected by testing, early testing after exposure at a single time point may miss many infections1. Testing that is repeated at different points in time, also referred to as serial testing, may be more likely to detect infection among close contacts of a COVID-19 case than testing done at a single point in time.\n\nEven if close contacts are monitored with serial testing, it is critical that they strictly adhere to other preventive measures including social distancing, wearing cloth face coverings for source control if the hazard assessment has determined that they do not require personal protective equipment such as a respirator or medical facemask for protection, and practicing hand hygiene.\n\nTesting may also be considered for possible close contactspdf icon of persons diagnosed with COVID-19 in collaboration with the local health department if resources permit. A risk-based approach to testing possible contacts of a person with confirmed COVID-19 may be applied. Such an approach should take into consideration the likelihood of exposure, which is affected by the characteristics of the workplace and the results of contact investigations. In some settings, broader testing (i.e., testing beyond individually identified close contacts to those who are possible close contacts), such as targeting workers who worked in the same area and during the same shift, may be considered as part of a strategy to control the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace. The rationale is that identification of contacts may be imprecise. High-risk settings that have demonstrated potential for rapid and widespread dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 include:\n\nHigh-density critical infrastructure workplaces\nWorkplaces where employees live in congregate settings (e.g., fishing vessels, offshore oil platforms, farmworker housing or wildland firefighter camps)\nWorkplaces with populations at risk for severe illness if they are infected, such as nursing homes\nEmployers are encouraged to consult with state, local, territorial, and tribal health departments to help inform decision-making about broad-based testing.\n\nIf employees are tested after close contact or possible close contact with someone who has a confirmed or probable diagnosis of COVID-19, care should be taken to inform these employees of their possible exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace while maintaining confidentiality of the individual with COVID-19, as required by the Americans with Disabilities Actexternal icon (ADA) and consistent with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidance regarding What You Should Know About COVID-19 and the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and Other EEO Lawsexternal icon.\n\nTesting asymptomatic individuals without known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 for early identification in special settings\nViral testing of workers without symptoms may be useful to detect COVID-19 early and stop transmission quickly, particularly in areas with moderate to substantial community transmission. When communities experience moderate to substantial transmission, workplace settings for which these approaches may be considered include:\n\nWorkplaces where physical distancing is difficult and workers are in close contact (within 6 feet for 15 minutes or more) with co-workers or the public\nWorkplaces in remote settings where medical evaluation or treatment may be delayed\nWorkplaces where continuity of operations is a high priority (e.g., critical infrastructure sectorsexternal icon)\nWorkplaces providing congregate housing for employees (e.g. fishing vessels, offshore oil platforms, farmworker housing or wildland firefighter camps)\nApproaches may include initial testing of all workers before entering a workplace, periodic testing of workers at regular intervals, and/or targeted testing of new workers or those returning from a prolonged absence. Several factors may be helpful in determining the interval for periodic testing including:\n\nThe availability of testing\nThe latency between exposure and development of a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral test\nBusinesses that fall into one of the workplace categories described above\nThe rate or change in rate of people getting infected in the surrounding community\nHow many employees tested positive during previous rounds of testing\nYour relevant experience with workplace outbreaks\nState, local, territorial, and tribal health departments may be able to provide assistance on any local context or guidance impacting the workplace. Before testing a large proportion of asymptomatic workers without known or suspected exposure, employers are encouraged to have a plan in place for how they will modify operations based on test results and manage a higher risk of false positive results in a low prevalence population.\n\nTesting to determine resolution of infection\nThe decision to end home isolation and return to work for employees with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection should be made in the context of clinical and local circumstances. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification tests have detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in some people\u2019s respiratory samples after they have recovered from COVID-19. Prolonged viral shedding has been demonstrated without direct evidence for virus capable of replicating or causing infection. Consequently, in most cases, evidence supports a symptom-based strategy to determine when to discontinue home isolation or precautions. For persons who are severely immunocompromised, a test-based strategy could be considered in consultation with infectious diseases experts. For all others, a test-based strategy is no longer recommended except to discontinue isolation or precautions earlier than would occur under the symptom-based strategy.\n\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act, employers are permitted to require a healthcare provider\u2019s noteexternal icon to verify that employees are healthy and able to return to work. However, as a practical matter, employers should be aware that healthcare provider offices and medical facilities may be extremely busy during periods of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and may not be able to provide such documentation in a timely manner. In such cases, employers should consider not requiring a healthcare provider\u2019s note for employees who are sick to validate their illness, qualify for sick leave, or to return to work. Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness, can recover at home without medical care, and can follow CDC recommendations to determine when to discontinue home isolation and return to work.\n\nPublic health surveillance for SARS-CoV-2\nTesting is considered to be surveillance when conducted to detect transmission hot spots, or to better understand disease trends in a workplace. These goals are consistent with employer-based occupational medicine surveillance programs. Occupational medicine surveillance programs may use testing to assess the burden of SARS-CoV-2 in the workforce, assess factors that place employees at risk for workplace acquisition of SARS-CoV-2, or evaluate the effectiveness of workplace infection control programs. Surveillance should only be undertaken if the results have a reasonable likelihood of benefiting workers.",

            "Text": "Analysis of recent influenza A(H3N2) viruses indicates antigenic drift from the previously prevalent strains A/Mississippi/1/85 and A/Leningrad/360/86. One reference variant virus strain, A/Victoria/7/87, was first isolated in Australia in April of this year. A second reference variant, A/Sichuan/2/87, was first isolated in China, also in April. In hemagglutination inhibition tests with antiserum from infected ferrets, antibody to A/Victoria/7/87 reacts poorly with other strains, even though the virus itself is inhibited well by antiserum to A/Mississippi/1/85 (Table 1). Antiserum to A/Sichuan/2/87 reacts at lower titers with viruses such as A/Mississippi/1/85 and A/Leningrad/360/86, which circulated earlier, than it does with A/Sichuan/2/87 antigen. Also, A/Sichuan/2/87 is inhibited poorly by antisera to all of the viruses that circulated earlier. Analysis of about 50 recently isolated A(H3N2) viruses from Asia, Oceania, and the United States indicates a spectrum of antigenic specificity, with many isolates having reaction patterns intermediate between A/Leningrad/360/86 and A/Sichuan/2/87.\n\nThe antibody response induced by the current type A(H3N2) vaccine component is greater toward the homologous A/Leningrad/360/86 virus than toward the reference variants A/Victoria/7/87 and A/Sichuan/2/87. This response confirms the existence of antigenic variation in recent virus isolates. Vaccinees in all age groups developed titers of 40 or more to A/Leningrad/360/86 with greater frequency than they did to the new antigenic variants (Table 2). In addition, the geometric mean titers were higher to the homologous A/Leningrad/360/86 antigen than to the antigenic variants A/Sichuan/2/87 or A/Victoria/7/87.

WHO Collaborating Center for Influenza, Influenza Br, Div of Viral Diseases, Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC.\n\nEditorial Note\nEditorial Note: In 1987, the World Health Organization Collaborating Centers for Influenza (Atlanta and London), in conjunction with National Influenza Centers in several countries in Asia and Oceania, detected antigenic variants of influenza A(H3N2). Evidence is accumulating that these viruses are infecting persons of all age groups, including high-risk elderly persons (1). These variants are associated with the reappearance of influenza A(H3N2) viruses after a period of quiescence during the winter of 1986/87.\n\nAntigenic variation has always complicated influenza vaccine formulation. The occurrence of viruses that exhibit antigenic drift from the vaccine strain has on occasion resulted in diminished vaccine efficacy, such as the failure of A/Port Chalmers/1/73 to protect against A/Victoria/3/75 (2). However, reduced vaccine efficacy has not always occurred in such situations. In 1972, vaccine containing A/Aichi/2/68 reduced cases of influenza by 60% in an outbreak caused by the antigenic drift variant A/England/42/72 (3), and, in 1977, A/Victoria/3/75 vaccine protected adults from A/Texas/1/77 infection with 80% efficacy (4). The mechanism of such cross (heterovariant) against A/Victoria/3/75 (2). However, reduced vaccine efficacy has not always occurred in such situations. In 1972, vaccine containing A/Aichi/2/68 reduced cases of influenza by 60% in an outbreak caused by the antigenic drift variant A/England/42/72 (3), and, in 1977, A/Victoria/3/75 vaccine protected adults from A/Texas/1/77 infection with 80% efficacy (4). The mechanism of such cross (heterovariant) protection is not precisely known. Although antigenic variants differ in some epitopes on the hemagglutinin, they also share other common hemagglutinin epitopes. Because type A(H3N2) viruses have circulated since 1968, most of the population has been primed by previously circulating strains and is, therefore, more responsive to heterovariant immunization. In addition, the antigenic changes described occurred in the hemagglutinin surface glycoprotein. Significant protection from illness may also be induced by the neuraminidase surface glycoprotein (5,6), which has shown less evidence of antigenic drift. Still other factors, such as the capacity of a strain to spread in the population, can emerge independently from changes in the antigenic properties of the hemagglutinin. Therefore, vaccine efficacy cannot be determined until placebo-controlled double-blind trials have been com pleted.\n\nNevertheless, laboratory studies, as well as preliminary observations during outbreaks of influenza A(H3N2) among high-risk residents of nursing homes, suggest that the A/Leningrad/360/86 component of the current vaccine may not provide optimal protection against presently circulating strains. These findings emphasize the need for health-care providers to be aware of the recommendations for use of the antiviral drug amantadine for controlling outbreaks and for prophylaxis or treatment of unprotected patients (7). Because amantadine, which is a prescription drug, must be given before exposure to prevent infection or within the first 1 or 2 days after onset of illness for treatment, contingency plans for its rapid use are needed. These plans include obtaining a physician's order to give the drug to high-risk patients at the first signs of influenza illness, knowing the precautions concerning dosage of the drug (particularly for persons with known renal insufficiency or with presumed reduced renal function, such as those over 64 years of age), and arranging for an adequate supply of the drug.",

            "Text": "Influenza viruses cause substantial medical and social problems throughout the world, and vaccination is the primary method for preventing influenza and its complications. Of the three types of influenza viruses (A, B, and C), only influenza A and B viruses cause epidemic human disease. Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase proteins are the two surface antigens that induce protective antibody responses and are the basis for subtyping influenza A viruses. Influenza B viruses are not categorized into subtypes (1). Since 1977, influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B viruses have been in global circulation, and these three viruses are currently included as vaccine components. Current inactivated vaccines provide essential protection when the vaccine antigens and the circulating viruses share high degree of similarity in the HA protein. Since new influenza virus antigenic variants emerge frequently from accumulation of point mutations in the HA protein (i.e., antigenic drift), influenza vaccine antigens need to be updated frequently, based on the results of global influenza surveillance (1), which includes clinical, virologic, and immunologic surveillance. In virologic surveillance, influenza viruses are characterized antigenically on the basis of ferret serum antibody cross-reactivity. Antigenic variants selected serologically are then tested for antibody cross-reactivity in human sera to evaluate the potential cross-protection against the antigenic variants provided by the current vaccines and to select vaccine strains for the next season (2,3).\n\nThe HA protein of influenza viruses is synthesized as a single polypeptide (HA0) that is subsequently cleaved into two polypeptides (HA1 and HA2) and forms into homotrimers. The HA1 polypeptide mutates more frequently than the HA2 polypeptide and plays a major role in natural selection (4,5). Three-dimensional (3-D) structure of the HA protein of A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) has been determined, and five antigenic sites on the HA1 polypeptide have been proposed conceptually (4\u20136). Of the 329 amino acid positions on HA1, 131 lie on or near the five antigenic sites (7,8). Twenty amino acid positions on HA1 have been mapped, based on laboratory variants selected in the presence of mouse monoclonal antibodies (9,10). In addition, 18 amino acid positions have been identified as being under positive selection by comparing 357 viruses isolated from 1984 to 1996 (7). In a recent study, 32 amino acid positions have been identified as diverse codons by comparing 525 viruses isolated from 1968 to 2000 (11). However, the importance of these amino acid positions in terms of predicting antibody cross-reactivity is unclear. Therefore, we conducted this study to explore the usefulness of these amino acid positions for predicting antigenic variants of influenza A/H3N2 viruses. The methods described in this study could be used to predict vaccine-induced cross-reactive antibody responses in humans, which may further improve the selection of vaccine strains.\n\nMethods\nCross-Reactive Antibody Data\nIn the current global influenza surveillance system, influenza viruses are characterized antigenically based on ferret serum hemagglutinin-inhibition (HAI) antibody cross-reactivity. We first screened publications for influenza H3N2 virus cross-reactive antibody data. Then, we searched the H3N2 viruses with cross-reactive antibody data for their amino acid sequences of the HA1 polypeptide (www.flu.lanl.govExternal Link) (8). Table 1 shows the full name, abbreviation, identification (ID) by type, and accession code of the H3N2 viruses (12\u201316). Six sets of ferret serum HAI cross-reactivity data were available for analysis. The first set included 11 viruses (55 pairwise comparisons, virus ID: A to K) isolated from 1971 to 1979 (12). The second set included 8 viruses (28 pairwise comparisons, virus ID: J, L to R) isolated from 1979 to 1987 (17). The third set included 10 viruses (45 pairwise comparisons, virus ID: S to AB) isolated from 1989 to 1994 (13). The fourth set included 8 viruses (28 pairwise comparisons, virus ID: AC to AJ) isolated from 1994 to 1996 (18). The fifth set included 5 viruses (10 pairwise comparisons, virus ID: AE, AK to AN) isolated from 1995 to 1999 (15). The sixth set included 6 viruses (15 pairwise comparisons, virus ID: AN to AT) isolated from 1999 to 2002 (16). A mathematical method had been proposed to calculate \u201cantigenic relatedness\u201d between two viruses (presented as a percentage) as a geometric mean of two ratios between the heterologous and homologous antibody titers (19,20).\n\nSince our study investigates the relationship between antigenic difference and amino acid changes in the HA1 polypeptide, the mathematical method was modified to calculate \u201cantigenic distance\u201d (i.e., reciprocal of antigenic relatedness). For example, if homologous titers of two viruses are 640 and 640 and two heterologous titers against each other are 320 and 320, the antigenic relatedness between these two viruses is ([320 x 320]/[640 x 640])\u00bd = 50%, and the antigenic distance between these two viruses is ([640 x 640]/[320 x 320])\u00bd = 2. Table 2 shows the antigenic distances of the 55 pairwise comparisons among the 11 viruses in the first set. In total, 181 pairwise comparisons among 45 viruses were available for analysis. Among the 181 pairwise comparisons, 56 (31%) have an antigenic distance <4 (i.e., similar antigenicity), and 125 (69%) have an antigenic distance >4 (i.e., antigenic variant) (21).\n\nSequence Alignment\nAmino acid sequences of the HA1 polypeptide were downloaded from the Los Alamos Influenza Sequence Database (8) or entered from the original publications if they were not available from the Los Alamos Influenza Sequence Database. Amino acid sequences of the 45 viruses were harmonized to same length (329 residues) and were numbered according to A/Aichi/2/68 HA1 sequence because the 3-D structure of the A/Aichi/2/68 hemagglutinin protein has been determined (4\u20136). Pairwise alignments among the 45 sequences were conducted by using S-Plus 2000 (Insightful Corporation, Seattle, WA). Pairwise-aligned amino acid sequence data were transformed into 0 (without change) and 1 (with change) and were further linked with the pairwise antigenic distance data for predicting analyses.\n\nPredicting Antigenic Variants\nThe first model was based on amino acid differences in the whole HA1 polypeptide (329 residues). The second model was based on amino acid differences in the five antigenic sites (131 residues) (see Appendix) (7,8). The third model was based on the 20 positions related to mouse monoclonal antibody binding (Table 2) (9,10). The fourth model was based on the 18 positions under positive selection (see Appendix) (7). The fifth model was based on the 32 codons of substantial diversity (see Appendix) (11). For evaluating the qualitative performance of the five prediction models, an antigenic variant was defined as antigenic distance >4 (21). Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and agreement of the five prediction models were calculated, and different cutoff levels of amino acid differences were compared by using the receiver-operating characteristic analysis (22).\n\n\n\nResults\nModel One\nFigure A shows the scatterplot between antigenic distance and number of amino acid changes in the HA1 peptide (328 residues). Among the 181 pairwise comparisons, the antigenic distance ranged from 1 to 181, and the number of amino acid changes in the HA1 peptide ranged from 1 to 36. Overall, the antigenic distance correlated to the number of amino acid changes in the HA1 polypeptide (R = 0.74, p < 0.001). Different cutoffs of amino acid changes in the HA1 polypeptide were evaluated for predicting antigenic variants. The highest agreement was found with a cutoff of >7 amino acid changes, which shows that the NPV, PPV, and agreement were 66% (31/47), 81% (109/134), and 77% (140/181), respectively (Figure A). Table 3 shows some unique pairwise comparisons with unusual patterns between antigenic distances and amino acid changes. A/Shanghai/11/87 and A/Victoria/7/87 were antigenically different (antigenic distance = 5.7), but they had only one amino acid difference (R247S). The position 247 is located at the antigenic site D. In addition to the amino acid change at position 247, A/Shanghai/11/87 had two more amino acid differences from A/Sichuan/2/87 (E156K, S186V) and A/Sydney/1/87 (A138S, N193K), but these three viruses were antigenically similar (antigenic distance <4). A/Victoria/7/87 had only two amino acid differences from A/Sichuan/2/87 (K156E, V186S) and A/Sydney/1/87 (S138A, K193N), but A/Victoria/7/87 was antigenically different from these two viruses (Table 3). The positions 156, 186, and 193 are located at the antigenic site B and the position 138 is located at the antigenic site A. Moreover, the positions 156 and 193 are also located at the mouse monoclonal antibody-binding sites (Figure).\n\nThe unusual patterns between antigenic distances and amino acid differences may be due to interaction between amino acid changes in the hemagglutinin or laboratory variability, which needs further experiments to clarify. In addition, A/Victoria/3/75 and A/Victoria/112/76 had only two amino acid differences (L3F, R229G), but they were antigenically different (antigenic distance = 5.7) (Table 3), which also requires further experiments to clarify. The position 3 is not located at any antigenic site, and the position 229 is located at the antigenic site D. We found that 3 of 80 pairwise comparisons with >12 amino acid changes had antigenic distance <4 (Figure A).\n\nA/Sydney/5/97 and A/Panama/2007/99 had 12 amino acid differences, but these two viruses were antigenically similar (antigenic distance = 1.4) based on ferret serum HAI titers (Table 3). However, inactivated vaccines containing A/Sydney/5/97 induced low serum antibody titers against A/Panama/2007/99 in humans; therefore, A/Sydney/5/97 was replaced by A/Panama/2007/99 as the vaccine strain for the 2000-01 season (3). A/HK/1550/2002 had 12 amino acid differences from A/Chile/6416/01 and 14 amino acid differences from A/Fujian/140/2000, but A/HK/1550/2002 was antigenically similar to these two viruses (Table 3). These three comparisons may indicate that interaction of multiple amino acid changes could potentially preserve the 3-D structure of HA1. Alternatively, the ferret serum HAI assay system is not sensitive enough to detect the antigenic difference.\n\nModel Two\nFigure B shows the scatterplot between antigenic distance and number of amino acid changes in the five antigenic sites (131 amino acid positions). Among the 181 pairwise comparisons, amino acid changes in the five antigenic sites ranged from 1 to 32. Overall, the antigenic distance correlated to number of amino acid changes in the five antigenic sites (R = 0.77, p < 0.001). Different cutoffs of amino acid changes in the five antigenic sites were evaluated for predicting antigenic variants. The highest agreement was found by using a cutoff of >7 amino acid changes, which shows that the NPV was 71% (42/59), PPV was 89% (108/122), and agreement was 83% (150/181) (Figure B).\n\nModel Three\nFigure C shows the scatter plot between antigenic distance and number of amino acid changes in the 20 amino acid positions related to mouse monoclonal antibody binding. Overall, the antigenic distance correlated to number of amino acid changes in the 20 amino acid positions (R = 0.74, p < 0.001). Different cutoffs of amino acid changes in the previously defined 20 amino acid positions were evaluated for predicting antigenic variants. The highest agreement was found by using a cutoff of >2 amino acid changes, which shows that the NPV was 64% (32/50), PPV was 82% (107/131), and agreement was 77% (139/181) (Figure C).\n\nModel Four\nFigure D shows the scatterplot between antigenic distance and number of amino acid changes in the 18 amino acid positions under positive selection. Overall, the antigenic distance correlated moderately to number of amino acid changes in the 18 amino acid positions (R = 0.43, p < 0.001). Different cutoffs of amino acid changes in the 18 amino acid positions were evaluated for predicting antigenic variants. The highest agreement was found by using a cutoff of >1 amino acid changes, which shows that the NPV was 55% (6/11), PPV was 71% (120/170), and agreement was 70% (126/181) (Figure D).\n\nModel Five\nFigure E shows the scatter plot between antigenic distance and number of amino acid changes in the 32 codons with substantial diversity. Overall, the antigenic distance correlated moderately to number of amino acid changes in the 32 codons (R = 0.68, p < 0.001). Different cutoffs of amino acid changes in the 32 codons were evaluated for predicting antigenic variants. The highest agreement was found by using a cutoff of >2 amino acid changes, which shows that the NPV was 72% (13/18), PPV was 74% (120/163), and agreement was 74% (133/181) (Figure E). Overall, the model based on the number of amino acid changes in the five antigenic sites has the highest correlation to the antigenic distance (R = 0.77) and the best performance for predicting antigenic variants (agreement = 83%).\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nWilson and Cox proposed that a drift variant of epidemiologic importance usually contains >4 amino acid changes located on >2 of the five antigenic sites, but they did not specify the amino acid positions in the five antigenic sites (5). Our study further showed that the model based on the number of amino acid changes in the 131 amino acid positions in the five antigenic sites had the highest correlation to the antigenic distance and the best performance for predicting antigenic variants. Theoretically, not all 131 amino acid positions in the five antigenic sites play a critical role in determining antigenicity, and some immunodominant positions (i.e., major antibody-binding sites) could be identified by using bioinformatics models and reverse genetic techniques (23\u201325). A model based on the immunodominant positions can potentially have a better performance than the model based on the five antigenic sites.\n\nThe model based on the 20 amino acid positions related to mouse monoclonal antibody binding only have moderate performance for predicting antigenic variants (R = 0.74, agreement = 77%), which indicates that mouse and ferret antibodies may recognize different B-cell epitopes. In addition, that models four and five have a low performance for predicting antigenic variants is not surprising, since these two models identified the amino acid positions only on the basis of virus sequence data without incorporating antigenic properties.\n\nAntigenic variants of influenza viruses are currently determined with the ferret serum HAI assay. The ferret serum HAI assay works well to distinguish major drift variants, but moderate differences are difficult to define reliably (26). As shown in Table 3, some unusual patterns between antigenic distance and amino acid changes in the HA1 may be caused by laboratory variability of the ferret serum HAI assay. The prediction models proposed in the present study may perform better if a more reliable assay system is used. Several studies have shown that neutralization assays are more sensitive for detecting influenza virus antibody responses than HAI assays (27,28). However, traditional neutralization assays based on cytopathic effect are labor-intensive and not suitable for a large-scale surveillance system. A simplified EIA-based neutralization assay may be the potential solution (29).\n\nSeveral studies have documented that one to three amino acid changes in the HA1 of influenza H1N1 and H3N2 viruses could possibly reduce the antigenicity and efficacy of inactivated vaccines in animal models (30\u201333), which are consistent with our results (Table 3). In animal studies, single mutation at amino acid position 156 of the HA1 of two H3N2 viruses was linked to the reduced antigenicity (32,33). The position 156 is located at the antigenic site B and the mouse monoclonal antibody-binding site (see Appendix). Overall, this evidence may indicate the existence of immunodominant positions in the HA1 and emphasize the importance of identifying the immunodominant positions to monitor the selection of vaccine strains and the process of vaccine manufacturing.\n\nThe current global surveillance system largely relies on ferret serum HAI data for selection of influenza vaccine strains (2,3). In some cases, human and ferret cross-reactive antibody data were not consistent (34,35). The methods described in this study could be applied to predict vaccine-induced cross-reactive antibody responses in humans, which may further improve the selection of vaccine strains (35).\n\n\n\nDr. Lee is an epidemiologist at MedImmune Vaccines, Inc., Mountain View, California.

            "Text": "(CNN) \u2014 Sitting squeezed between a number of strangers on board an aircraft might feel like a risky position during these uncertain times.\nBut according to some experts who point to the very few documented cases of in-flight transmission, the chances of catching Covid-19 while on board a flight are actually relatively slim.\nFear of flying during the pandemic has drastically reduced global air traffic, which has also been restricted due to border closures. If new scientific claims are borne out, the perceived heightened risk of boarding an airplane could be unfounded.\nIn one case, about 328 passengers and crew members were tested for coronavirus after it was learned that a March 31 flight from the US to Taiwan had been carrying 12 passengers who were symptomatic at the time. However, all the other passengers tested negative, as did the crew members.\nAnd while there have certainly been cases of infected passengers passing the virus on to an airplane's crew or fellow travelers in recent months, the transmission rates are low.\nA study recently published in medical journal JAMA Network Open found evidence of the possible spread of coronavirus during a four-hour flight from Tel Aviv to Frankfurt in March.\nTwo passengers developed infections after flying with a group of tourists who had come into contact with an infected hotel manager and also became infected, according to researchers from the Institute for Medical Virology at Goethe University in Frankfurt.\nThe two who may have been infected were seated at the back of the aircraft, directly across the aisle from seven passengers who had unknowingly picked up the virus.\nAn earlier flight from the UK to Vietnam on March 2, in which one passenger seemingly spread the virus to around 14 other passengers, as well as a crew member, is so far believed to be the only known on-board transmission to multiple people.\nOne explanation for the apparently low risk level is that the air in modern aircraft cabins is replaced with new fresh air every two to three minutes, and most planes are fitted with air filters designed to trap 99.99% of particles.\nMeanwhile, various new protocols have been implemented, such as face-coverings for both passengers and crew, which is mandatory on most airlines, temperature screenings, as well as more intensive cabin cleaning and limited movement in the cabin during flight.\nArnold Barnett, a professor of statistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, tried to quantify the odds of becoming infected with the virus while on board a short flight in a recent study that looked at the benefits of the empty middle seat policy. According to his findings, based on short haul flights in the US on aircraft configured with three seats on either side of the aisle, such as the Airbus 320 and the Boeing 737 -- and assuming everyone is wearing a mask -- the risk of catching the virus on a full flight is just 1 in 4,300. Those odds fall to 1 in 7,700 if the middle seat is vacant.\n\"Most things are more dangerous now than they were before Covid, and aviation is no exception to that,\" he tells CNN Travel.\n\"But three things have to go wrong for you to get infected (on a flight). There has to be a Covid-19 patient on board and they have to be contagious,\" he says. \"If there is such a person on your flight, assuming they are wearing a mask, it has to fail to prevent the transmission.\n\"They also have to be close enough that there's a danger you could suffer from the transmission.\"\nBarnett says he took all of these probabilities into account before determining an overall transmission risk.These figures are specifically for two-hour flights within the United States, the country currently with the highest number of Covid-19 cases in the world.\nThe odds will be lower for flights taken in parts of the globe with few cases and higher for long haul flights as \"the ratio of proximity is a factor along with the existence of proximity,\" he says.\nBarnett goes on to state that there isn't much of a difference in terms of risk between passengers sitting in an aisle seat on a full flight and those in the window seat.\nHowever, the chances of becoming infected are ever so slightly higher for those in aisle seats, because they simply have more people around them.\n\"You're endangered by the people sitting next to you in the same row,\" he says. \"And to a lesser extent, the people in the row behind and the row ahead.\n\"Statistically, the window seat is a little safer than the middle seat or the aisle seat on a plane that's full. But it's not a big difference.\" Barnett's research is based on the assumption that flights are operating at full volume, but it's worth noting that many are still running at reduced capacity.\nAlthough the US Transportation Security Administration reported that traffic through airport security checkpoints had passed 800,000 for the first time since the pandemic earlier in August, this was still a 31% decrease on the numbers for the same day in 2019.\nThe professor is a strong supporter of the middle seats empty policy, which has been adopted by the likes of Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways.\nHowever, the International Air Transport Association (IATA,) describes this approach as \"economically unfeasible\" for airlines.\n\"Screening, face coverings and masks are among the many layers of measures that we are recommending,\" Alexandre de Juniac, IATA's Director General and CEO said in an official statement released last month. \"Leaving the middle seat empty, however, is not.\"\nDe Juniac goes on to suggest that an effective Covid-19 test that can be administered at scale, and immunity passports could also be included as temporary biosecurity measures if they become available.\n\"We must arrive at a solution that gives passengers the confidence to fly and keeps the cost of flying affordable,\" he adds. \"One without the other will have no lasting benefit.\"\nAlthough different airlines have slightly different measures in place, the overall guidance for passengers is to wear a mask, wash their hands regularly and check in online to minimize the risks of in flight transmission. However, Barnett recommends that travelers take things one step further by wearing a shield.\n\"There are various things that can be done to take the risk, which is small, and make it even smaller,\" he says.\n\"Because it (a shield) covers your eyes, nose and mouth, it lessens the risk of others infecting you.\n\"The science is changing every day, but my understanding is, if you wear a mask, it greatly reduces the chance of you infecting others. But it doesn't protect you all that much, whereas a shield will protect you.\n\"If I were flying now, I would certainly wear a shield.\"\nThis view is somewhat supported by a new research report from the UK's University of Edinburgh and Heriot-Watt University, which concludes that using plastic barriers called personal protection seat shields will reduce the risk of Covid-19 contamination significantly, provided they are worn with face masks.\nAccording to the \"Face Coverings, Aerosol Dispersion and Mitigation of Virus Transmission Risk\" report, jets of air can leak from the sides and back as well as the front of face masks.\nIt recommends that aircraft seats be fitted with personal protection windows (PPW,) clear plastic barriers designed by UK-based aircraft interior and exterior specialist RAS Completions, which can be secured to the back and sides of any seat on an airplane.\n\"Our recommendation is that airlines should make face masks mandatory, and if used in conjunction with PPW and regular cleaning of PPW, Covid-19 contamination risk is kept to a minimum,\" say the report's co-author Dr. Cathal Cummins, an assistant professor at Heriot-Watt University, also in Edinburgh.\n\"If all three measures are mandatory, together with good personal hygiene, airlines can increase passenger protection.\"\nHigh-risk groups\nIn July, Qatar Airways became the first airline to make it compulsory for passengers to wear a face shield in addition to a face mask or face covering.\nThe shields, which are supplied by the carrier, are obligatory for economy class passengers, unless they're eating or drinking, while those traveling in business class can wear them \"at their own discretion, as they enjoy more space and privacy.\"\nHowever, all passengers must wear them during boarding and deplaning.\nPhilippine Airlines followed suit earlier this month, so it seems likely other carriers may choose to implement this rule in the future.\nBefore boarding their flight, customers traveling with the Middle East carrier will be issued with protection kits -- including face shields, hand sanitizer, a surgical face mask and disposable gloves.\nAlthough it's clear that such precautions can greatly limit the danger of infection, which is already relatively slim, for some travelers, any level of risk is simply too much of a gamble, particularly those in high-risk groups.\nBarnett stresses that it will take the development of a vaccine or a change in the care available to Covid-19 patients for those anxious travelers to feel comfortable flying again, regardless of how many safety measures are put in place.\nHe is choosing not to fly himself at present due to various risk factors -- at 72, Barnett has a higher risk of contracting the virus, while men are more likely to die from the virus than women.\n\"I miss it quite a bit,\" he admits. \"I think flying is beautiful and under normal circumstances inordinately safe.\n\"But these are not normal circumstances.\"",

            "Text": "(CNN)Coronavirus cases linked to the Sturgis motorcycle rally in South Dakota last week have now reached across state lines to Nebraska, public health officials said.\n\nAt least seven Covid-19 cases in Nebraska's Panhandle region have been tied to the rally, Kim Engel, director of the Panhandle Public Health District, confirmed in an email to CNN.\nThe department said that contact tracing had been completed, and it declined to comment further. The cases that have appeared in Nebraska are the latest to be connected to the 80th annual Sturgis motorcycle rally, which took place August 7-16.\nMinnesota also confirmed 15 cases of Covid-19 connected with the rally, according to Kris Ehresmann, director of the Minnesota Health Department Infectious Disease Division. Of those 15 cases, one person has been hospitalized. Health officials say they expect to see additional cases in the next few days, Ehresmann said.\nSouth Dakota state health officials announced Thursday that a person who worked at a tattoo shop in Sturgis had tested positive for the virus and could have possibly exposed people during the event last week.\nThe person was an employee of Asylum Tattoo Sturgis and could have spread the virus to others on August 13-17 from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m., officials said.\nEarlier this week, officials said a person who spent hours at a bar during the rally had also tested positive. That individual visited One-Eyed Jack's Saloon in Sturgis on August 11 from noon to 5:30 p.m. while able to transmit the virus to others, health officials said.\nAnyone who visited either the tattoo shop or the saloon, which are located at the same address, during that period should monitor for symptoms for 14 days after the visit.\nRally had raised concerns\nHealth experts were concerned that this year's Sturgis motorcycle rally could be a \"super spreader\" event. The 10-day mass gathering typically draws crowds of more than 500,000 people from all over the country, including coronavirus hotspots.\nSouth Dakota Department of Transportation officials tracked more than 462,000 vehicles entering Sturgis during the rally. Though the total was a 7.5% decline from the previous year, it is still one of the largest mass gatherings since the start of the pandemic. Many of the attendees did not comply with health guidelines such as wearing masks and keeping distance from others, as seen at a concert for the rock band Smash Mouth.\nA little more than 60% of people in Sturgis voted against holding the motorcyle event. But city officials said they felt they wouldn't have been able to stop the crowds from coming in and instead opted to prepare for the event as best they could.\n\"There are people throughout America who have been locked up for months and months,\" Daniel Ainslie, the city manager, told CNN last week. \"So we kept hearing from people saying it doesn't matter, they are coming to Sturgis. So with that, ultimately the council decided that it was really vital for the community to be prepared for the additional people that we're going to end up having.\"\nSouth Dakota reported 193 new cases on Friday. It's one of several states that have seen an increase in new cases this past week compared to the week prior, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.",

            "HeadLine": "The psychology behind why some college students break Covid-19 rules",
            "Text": "(CNN)Going off to college is, for many young adults, their first real plunge into freedom and adulthood. It's where they're encouraged to take risks and find new connections in dining halls and laundry rooms.\n\nBut those collegiate rites of passage aren't possible if they're largely confined to an extra-long twin bed in a stuffy dorm room, peering out at the world through barred windows.\nThe fall 2020 semester looks a lot like that for some undergraduates who've returned to campus during the pandemic.\nAnd as anticipated, some of those undergrads have already started to rebel.\nSocial students have packed fraternity houses and dorm hallways and snaked their way through bars -- all venues for coronavirus transmission. Schools including the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill and the University of Notre Dame have had to transition to virtual classes, at least for a time, after cases cropped up days into the semester.\nIt's easy to blame the clusters of cases solely on the students -- it plays perfectly into the stereotype of teenage recklessness and vanity.\nBut their risky decisions have more to do with their development and mental resilience than conscious rule-breaking, three developmental psychologists told CNN. Students walk through the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in August. The university canceled classes after clusters of coronavirus cases appeared.\nCNN spoke with the following experts about the drivers behind these risky decisions:\nHannah Schacter, an assistant professor and developmental psychologist at Wayne State University\nBen Locke, the senior director for Counseling & Psychological Services at Pennsylvania State University\nMary Karapetian Alvord, director of the private practice Alvord, Baker & Associates who mostly counsels children, teens and young adults.\nAll three experts know college students well. Schacter teaches them; Locke counsels them on campus; Alvord is their psychologist back at home.\nCollegiate life doesn't look at all like what it used to, but many of the exciting firsts college promises -- freedom, independence and friendships -- are still there, and they're still luring students to act in ways that can expose them or others to coronavirus, they said.\nTeens are wired to take risks\nThere's some truth to the teenage stereotype of risk taking. Young adults are more prone to make in-the-moment decisions because they're wired that way.\nDuring adolescence and into adulthood, the brain region most sensitive to social rewards -- the amygdala -- develops at a much faster rate than the frontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for rational, consequence-driven decision making. That imbalance may drive them to make decisions others deem risky, like visiting friends or attending a party, Locke said.\n\"Their decision making ... is more about 'what's in the moment, what am I missing out on, what is the thing that would make me happiest in this moment?'\" he said.\nTeens are also particularly sensitive to the potential rewards of risky decisions at this stage in their life. It's not that they don't understand the negative consequences, but they struggle to regulate those impulses that lead them to take risks because the potential reward is too great, said Schacter, who leads a lab at Wayne State University on adolescent relationships.\n\"It's this combination of being restricted from social contact for a while at an age where spending time with peers is so essential to development, to making teenagers feel good, and so, there's some sort of calculation going on where the perceived benefit -- 'I get to spend time with friends' -- seems to be outweighing the potential costs,\" Schacter said.\nWhen you plop students back on campus after a spring and summer spent cooped up in their childhood bedrooms, many of them will take those opportunities to connect with their friends and strangers. Their fear of the virus may be overtaken by their eagerness to connect, she said.\nThey depend on social connections to build their identities\nThe pandemic hasn't dulled young people's desire to belong.\n\"No one's going back to college because they want to sit in their dorm all weekend by themselves,\" Schacter said.\nPeer approval is increasingly important throughout adolescence, and young adults depend on their social connections to build their identities. They still want to see their friends and meet new people, a hallmark of college that's become increasingly difficult when classes are conducted with students six feet apart -- or states apart, over Zoom. So some will party. \"Peers are so essential that it's no coincidence that we're seeing these behaviors more and that they're particularly peer-oriented,\" Schacter said.\nAnd there is a risk teenagers take quite seriously -- the risk of rejection. So if they see someone they respect or admire, or with some sort of perceived social power, ignoring social distancing guidelines or attending a party, they may hesitate to call that person out -- criticizing another student could mean their ostracization, Locke said.\nAlvord studies resilience, or the ability to cope with crises. Social connections, she said, build resilience. Having strong bonds and strong friendships helps us get through difficult times -- including times like these.\nFor some students, isolation may feel scarier than the virus itself.\n\"The sense of belonging and peer acceptance, I think, outweighs judgment,\" Alvord said.\nThey are getting mixed messages from adults\nColleges can't seem to decide whether it's safe for students to return to campus. Many universities gave students mere days to move off-campus in March and resume classes virtually. Months later, they're canceling in-person classes after clusters of coronavirus cases appeared.\nBut because schools have reopened, students may assume that they'll be safe to resume life as they knew it, Alvord said.\nThey may also have internalized the general advice toward the beginning of the pandemic, Alvord said, which government officials have repeated in bids to reopen schools -- that children and teens are far less likely to get sick from coronavirus. (The risk of death is still relatively low, but some teenagers have died from Covid-19). \"The knowledge base has shifted, but I think it's sort of reinforced for a lot of them that they were not part of the high-risk group,\" Alvord said.\nReopening schools and bringing students back to campus open up opportunities for exposure they wouldn't have had at home. The very act of resuming in-person classes makes it more likely for some students to do risky things, Schacter said.\n\"We can't control much, but we can control what sort of opportunities students have to break these rules,\" she said. \"Most college campuses are literally engineered to promote social interaction. Students coming back ... must navigate this in a way it wasn't built for.\"\nUniversities host students from across the US and the world. Every family, city, state and country is handling coronavirus in unique ways. Bring them all back to campus and there are bound to be disconnects in whether they obey social distancing and mask guidelines, Locke said.\n\"The polarization of mask wearing as a public health expectation is something that's embedded in the arrival of students,\" he said.\nThey're still processing the pandemic\nDisappointment is inevitable in times like these. Dashed expectations coupled with the challenges brought on by the pandemic that affect students in different ways leave them to navigate the uncertain present on their own.\n\"This is incredibly hard,\" Locke said. \"None of this is normal, none of this is baseline, all of this has elements that are disappointing in it.\" Preliminary health data has already confirmed what Locke and other psychologists feared was true -- that young people have been overwhelmed by anxiety and depression since the start of the pandemic. The National Center for Health Statistics and the US Census Bureau estimate that more than a third of Americans have experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety since spring.\nSome students may seek out activities that restore a sense of normalcy, or they could seek out the experiences they longed for that the pandemic \"There's this desire to hold on to the way that it used to be, the way they wanted it to be,\" Locke said. \"It's one of the hardest parts of the pandemic -- to reckon with a reality that none of us developed knowing about.\"\nYoung people whose experiences with coronavirus are more personal may be more willing to obey those safety guidelines. But many Americans, luckily, have been spared by the virus. It may still seem foreign or improbable to young people who haven't experienced the virus, which could it seem less serious, the psychologists said.\n\"People often talk about how adolescents feel invulnerable,\" said Locke. \"And that may or may not be true. But that sense that your behavior impacts your entire community, or could cause your neighbor to die two months from now, is a really hard thing to take in.\"\nSchools may be taking the wrong approach\nAll three psychologists said they believe the majority of students are taking the pandemic seriously and acting accordingly. Viral videos of maskless parties and packed bars account for hundreds out of the nearly 20 million college students in the US, they said.\nThe trouble with the Covid-19 pandemic, though, is that even a few students who break pandemic guidelines could set off a chain of infection that can -- and has -- canceled classes and activities, Schacter said. Schools have struggled to figure out what methods work to convince students to stay safe. And it's not a problem unique to college students -- adults are ignoring the advice of public health officials, too.\nIt's already apparent, though, that schools telling students to abstain completely from social interaction or threatening them with suspension or worse doesn't work. It hasn't worked with other risky behaviors like drinking and driving or unprotected sex, either, Schacter said.\nAlvord said universities need to share that responsibility of keeping those on campus safe with students. Shifting blame onto students could stir up rebellion.\nAt Penn State, Locke said he and his colleagues have tried to \"shift [the students'] culture of thinking\" to one of mutual benefit and sacrifice, one that requires everyone's buy-in to take care of each other.\nGetting 100% of students to obey safety guidelines is one of the challenges of Covid-19 that feels unsolvable -- how can a school keep thousands of students in line when sports teams with fewer than 50 members aren't even immune Regarding students with empathy, the psychologists said, and acknowledging the sacrifices they've already made could be a good, if imperfect, place to start.\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the action taken by Notre Dame when Covid-19 cases spiked after the start of school. Notre Dame transitioned to virtual classes, but the students remained on campus. They have since transitioned back to in-person classes.",

            "HeadLine": "Do some people have protection against the coronavirus?",
            "Text": "(CNN)We're now more than seven months into the coronavirus pandemic that has upended the lives of most of Earth's inhabitants. And while it is true that the scientific community has learned many things about the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, there are also many gaps in our understanding.\n\nOne big mystery: Why do some people get very sick and even die from their illness, while other similar people show no symptoms and may not realize they've been infected at all?\nWe know some of the big factors that put people at higher risk of having a severe, even fatal, course of disease: being over 60; being overweight or obese; having one or more chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney or lung disease, and cancer; and being a person of color -- Black, Latinx or Native American. But might the opposite also be true: Could certain people actually have some type of protection? A recently published summary article in the journal Nature Reviews Immunology put forth a tantalizing possibility: A large percentage of the population appears to have immune cells that are able to recognize parts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and that may possibly be giving them a head start in fighting off an infection. In other words, some people may have some unknown degree of protection.\n\"What we found is that people that had never been exposed to SARS Cov2 ... about half of the people had some T-cell reactivity,\" co-author of the paper Alessandro Sette from the Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research at La Jolla Institute for Immunology, told CNN.\nImmunology 101\nTo understand why that's important, here's a little crash course in immunology. The human immune system, which is tasked with keeping you healthy in the face of bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic and other invaders, has two main components: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system.\nThe innate immune system is the very first line of defense. Parts of it include physical barriers like your skin and mucosal membranes, which physically stop invaders from getting in. It also includes certain cells, proteins and chemicals that do things like create inflammation and destroy invading cells. Where the innate immune system is immediate and nonspecific (it tries to stop anything from entering the body), the adaptive immune system is targeted against a specific and previously recognized invader. This takes a bit longer to kick into gear.\nThe adaptive immune system includes a type of white blood cell, called a B cell, which patrols the body looking for bad guys. B cells each have a unique antibody that sits on its surface and can bind to a unique antigen (the technical name for the foreign invader) and stop it from entering a host cell. When it finds and binds to a bad guy, the B cell gets activated: it copies itself and churns out antibodies, eventually creating a mega-army of neutralizers for that particular invader. That's where antibodies created by the immune systems of people who've had Covid-19 come from. Unfortunately, a few recent studies have found that antibodies to this particular coronavirus can fade away pretty quickly especially in people who have had mild cases of Covid-19. This has worried many researchers: because the antibody response appears to fade quickly, the scientific community is not sure how long a person who has been infected with this virus will stay protected from a new infection. This is also worrisome since we are relying on vaccines to trigger an antibody response to help protect us, and we want that protection to last a long time.\nFortunately, antibodies aren't the only weapon our adaptive immune system uses to stave off an infection. Enter the T cell. T cells, which come in three varieties, are created by the body after an infection to help with future infections from the same invader. One of those T cells helps the body remember that invader in case it comes knocking again, another hunts down and destroys infected host cells and a third helps out in other ways.\nAccidental discovery\nIt's T cells like those, which reacted to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, that Sette and his co-author Shane Crotty discovered -- quite by accident -- in the blood of people collected several years before this pandemic began.\nThey were running an experiment with Covid-19 convalescent blood. Because they needed a \"negative control\" to compare against the convalescent blood, they picked blood samples from healthy people collected in San Diego between 2015 and 2018. \"There was no way these people had been exposed to SARS-CoV2. And when we ran those ... it turns out the negative control was not so negative: about half of the people had reactivity,\" Sette explained.\n\"Shane and I pored over the data; we were looking at it from the right, from the left, from the top, from the bottom -- and it was really 'real'; this reactivity was real. So, this showed that people that have never seen this virus have some T-cell reactivity against the virus.\"\nThat paper was published at the end of June in the journal Cell.\nSette and Crotty note in their current summary article that they aren't the only ones to have seen this.\n\"That has been now confirmed in different continents, different labs, with different techniques, which is one of the hallmarks of when you start to actually really believe that something is scientifically well-established because it's found independently by different studies and different labs,\" said Sette.\nThey speculate that this T cell recognition of parts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may come in part from past exposure to one of the four known circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold in millions of people every year.\n\"The assumption is that's actually coming from common cold coronaviruses that people have seen before, and Alex's side was working really hard to actually figure that out, because that's still scientifically a major debate,\" said Crotty.\nFriend or foe?\nBut many questions remain -- including whether this recognition to parts of SARS-CoV-2 by T cells helps or hurts.\n\"Would these memory T cells be helpful for protecting you against Covid-19 disease, that's the huge question,\" said Crotty. \"We don't know if [the T cells] are helpful or not, but we think it's reasonable to speculate that they may be helpful. It's not that we think they would completely protect against any infection at all, but if you already have some cells around, they can fight the virus faster and so it's plausible that instead of ending up in the ICU, you don't. And instead of ending up in the hospital, you just end up with a bad cold.\" Other researchers are also intrigued by the possibilities put forth by this discovery.\nDr. Arturo Casadevall told CNN his first thought was \"Not surprising, important, good to know.\" Casadevall chairs the department of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.\n\"Because these coronaviruses are all related, given that every year we run into one of them, it's not surprising that we have T cells that are reactive with them,\" he said. But, like Sette and Crotty, he questions whether this reactivity is a good thing or a bad thing.\nA few months ago, Casadevall explored the idea of why some people get sick and some don't in an opinion piece he co-wrote for Bloomberg.com. \"One of the variables is what we call the immunological history. All the things that you have run into in your life, all the vaccines, the colds, all the GI upsets, have created a background knowledge that can help you or hurt you,\" explained Casadevall.\n\"One of the things we know about this disease is that what kills you is an over exuberant immune response, in the lung... So, when you say, 'They have T-cell reactivity,' well that could help in some people, it could hurt in others,\" he said.\nCasadevall speculates that some of the asymptomatic people may be able to rapidly clear the virus thanks to this T-cell reactivity. \"At the same time, some of the very sick people have that immunological history that instead of helping them, makes the immune system throw everything at it, and the net result is that you get this over-exuberant response,\" he said, referring to the cytokine storm that some of the sickest of the sick with Covid-19 experience.\nSette and Crotty are looking into that possibility. But they say the overreaction of the innate immune system, not overreacting T cells, appears to set off the cytokine storm. \"The data are still somewhat preliminary, but I think it's in that direction. Certainly, we have not seen an immune response related to T cells in overdrive in the very severe cases,\" said Sette.\nBig implications for vaccines\nSo, assuming that a large portion of the population has some kind of T-cell reactivity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, what does that mean for vaccine efforts?\nThere are several implications.\nFor Dr. Bruce Walker, an infectious disease physician-scientist who spends most of his time doing research in human immunology, it opens the door to a different type of vaccine, similar to the ones that are being used against certain cancers, like melanoma.\n\"What we know is that most vaccines that have been generated thus far have been based on generating antibodies. Now, antibodies should theoretically be able to prevent any cells from becoming infected -- if you have enough antibodies around and any virus coming in, before it gets a chance to infect a cell, can be theoretically neutralized by the right kind of antibody,\" explained Walker, who is the founding director of the Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, MIT and Harvard. \"On the other hand, if some viruses sneak through and infect a cell; then the body is dependent upon T cells to eliminate the virus,\" he said. \"And therein lies the opportunity for us to rethink what we're doing in terms of vaccination -- because those T cells, at least theoretically, could be highly potent and could attenuate the disease. In other words, they wouldn't protect against infection, but they might make infections so asymptomatic that you would not notice it yourself and, in fact, you would never have enough virus in your body to transmit it to somebody else. That's the hypothesis.\"\nAnother implication is that the results of a small, Phase 1 vaccine trial could be misinterpreted in one way or another if the T-cell reactivity status of participants isn't taken into account. \"For example, if subjects with pre-existing reactivity were sorted unevenly in different vaccine dose groups, this might lead to erroneous conclusions,\" Sette and Crotty wrote in their paper.\nFurthermore, Sette said upcoming vaccine trials could help uncover the effect of this T-cell cross-reactivity a lot more cheaply and easily than running other experiments. \"It is a conceivable that if you have 10 people that have reactivity and 10 people that don't have the pre-existing reactivity and you vaccinate them with a SARS CoV-2 vaccine, the ones that have the pre-existing immunity will respond faster or better to a vaccine. The beauty of that is that that is a relatively fast study with a smaller number [of people] ... So, we have been suggesting to anybody that is running vaccine trials to also measure T-cell response,\" said Sette.\nThe herd (immunity) grows stronger\nThere are also implications for when we might achieve \"herd immunity\" -- meaning that enough of the population is immune to SARS-CoV-2, thanks either to infection or vaccination, and the virus can no longer be as easily transmitted.\n\"For herd immunity, if indeed we have a very large proportion of the population already being immune in one way or another, through these cellular responses, they can count towards the pool that you need to establish herd immunity. If you have 50% already in a way immune, because of these existing immune responses, then you don't need 60 to 80%, you need 10 to 30% -- you have covered the 50% already. The implications of having some pre-existing immunity suggests that maybe you need a small proportion of the population to be impacted before the epidemic wave dies out,\" said Dr. John Ioannidis, a professor of medicine and epidemiology and population health at Stanford University. In other words, if there is a level of herd immunity, that changes how fast the virus ripples through different communities and populations.\nIn fact, Sette and Crotty wrote in their paper, \"It should be noted that if some degree of pre-existing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 exists in the general population, this could also influence epidemiological modelling ...\"\nCrotty points to a SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology paper that appeared in the journal Science at the end of May that tried to model transmission of the virus going forward. \"We thought it was really striking that a number of the major differences in their models really came down to immunity, one way or another,\" he said.\nFor example, Crotty said when the authors added a hypothetical 30% immunity to their epidemiological model of how many cases there would be in the world over the next couple of years, the virus faded away in the near future before returning in three or four years.\nMore questions than answers for now\nAnd that brings us to another question raised by Sette and Crotty's paper: because the common circulating coronaviruses (CCC) appear in different places, at different times, could some countries, cities or localities be disproportionately affected (or spared) because the population had less exposure to those CCCs, thus creating less opportunity to develop cross-reactivity?\n\"If the pre-existing T-cell immunity is related to CCC exposure, it will become important to better understand the patterns of CCC exposure in space and time. It is well established that the four main CCCs are cyclical in their prevalence, following multiyear cycles, which can differ across geographical locations. This leads to the speculative hypothesis that differences in CCC geo-distribution might correlate with burden of COVID-19 disease severity,\" Sette and Crotty wrote. So, ultimately can it be said that some people have at least partial natural protection from SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus, if they have T-cell cross-reactivity?\n\"The biggest problem is that everybody wants a simple answer,\" said Johns Hopkins' Casadevall. \"What nobody wants to hear is that it's unpredictable, because many variables play together in ways that you can't put together: your history, your nutrition, how you got infected, how much [virus] you got -- even the time of the day you got infected. And all these variables combine in ways that are unpredictable.\"",

People don't go to hospitals when they get chest pain,\" he added. \"There's a lot of different things that could go wrong, beyond the economy.\"\nHe also gave another grim warning. \"There's projections that if you stay shut down, the number of deaths unrelated to Covid will go up,\" he said. \"The number of suicides, overdoses, family issues, such as child abuse and things like that, they all go up.\"\nUltimately, Fauci said that he believes the country can come together to overcome the virus.\nThe CDC issued a dire warning for the fall\nA top federal health official is issuing a dire warning: Follow recommended coronavirus measures or risk having the worst fall in US public health history.\n\"For your country right now and for the war that we're in against Covid, I'm asking you to do four simple things: wear a mask, social distance, wash your hands and be smart about crowds,\" said Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\"I'm not asking some of America to do it,\" he told WebMD. \"We all gotta do it.\"\nWithout following the recommendations, this could be \"the worst fall, from a public health perspective, we've ever had,\" he said.\nSome officials are already preparing for the coming months.\nMayor Quinton Lucas of Kansas City, Missouri, extended the city's coronavirus state of emergency order until January 16, 2021. The order requires most people to wear face coverings in public places and limits crowds at bars to 50% capacity.\n\"It is now obvious to everyone that Covid-19 is not going away over the next five months,\" Kansas City Health Department Director Dr. Rex Archer said in a news release Thursday. \"As we move out of summer and into fall and winter, we will still be confronting this health emergency.\"\nThe flu season also occurs in the fall and winter, the CDC said. Coronavirus has infected more than 5.2 million people, according to Johns Hopkins University.\nCoronavirus continues to spread at high rates across the South, Midwest and West -- even as the total number of new cases has declined following a summer surge.\nThe seven-day average of daily coronavirus deaths was over 1,000 on Thursday, the 18th consecutive day the US averaged over 1,000 deaths per day.\n\"You can't run away from the numbers,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergies and Diseases, said during a National Geographic panel Thursday. \"You can't run away from the numbers of people who've died, the number of people getting hospitalized, the surges we're seeing.\"\nYou asked, we're answering: Your top coronavirus questions\nOver 2,000 people quarantined as schools reopen\nAs educators and parents clash over starting in-person classes, some schools that have reopened have seen new cases.\nMore than 2,000 students, teachers and staff have been placed under quarantine in the few reopened districts in several states, a CNN tally of reported cases shows. Of those, at least 230 positive coronavirus cases have been reported among the school districts reopened for in-person learning. In Georgia, more than 1,100 students, teachers and staff in the Cherokee County School District. about 40 miles north of downtown Atlanta, are under quarantine due to dozens of Covid-19 positive cases or exposure. Schools reopened 10 days ago.\n\"The children in this beautiful state are not disposable, but that is exactly how you and the superintendent are regarding them,\" Brandy Heath, a mother of two Cherokee County students, wrote in a letter to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp.\nIn Florida, a day after the Martin County School District reopened for in-person teaching, an entire elementary class and one bus route were placed under quarantine after a student showed coronavirus symptoms, spokeswoman Jennifer DeShazo said Wednesday. In new guidance released Thursday, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advised face coverings can be worn safely by children over the age of 2, except for rare exceptions.\n\"Just like children understand that they must wear bicycle helmets and buckle into their car seats, they will come to learn to wear masks routinely when necessary,\" AAP President Dr. Sally Goza said in a news release. She added, \"As parents prepare to send their children to school and into childcare settings, cloth face coverings should be part of their new normal.\"\nForecast predicts death toll to rise to 189,000 by September 5\nAn ensemble forecast published by the CDC projects the total number of deaths from coronavirus will reach nearly 189,000 in the next three weeks.\nThe new projections, published Thursday, forecast 188,982 deaths by September 5, with a possible range of 181,375 to 201,431 deaths.\n\"State- and territory-level ensemble forecasts predict that the number of reported new deaths per week may increase over the next four weeks in Colorado and may decrease in Arizona, the Northern Mariana Islands, Vermont, and Wyoming,\" the CDC says on its forecasting website.\nThe prediction relies on about two dozen individual forecasts from outside institutions and researchers.\nUnlike some individual models, the CDC's ensemble forecast offers projections only about a month ahead. A previous ensemble forecast, published July 23, projected roughly 164,477 coronavirus deaths by Saturday.\nAt least 167,029 people have already died from Covid-19 in the United States, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.\nAnti-vaxxers ramp up conspiracy theories\nThe CDC's Dr. Redfield is cautiously optimistic that one or more coronavirus vaccines will be ready by the start of 2021. There are 270 active trials for coronavirus treatments, experts say.\nDirector of the National Institutes of Health Dr. Francis Collins expects the National Academy of Sciences to make \"interim, high-level\" recommendations about who should get priority for a vaccine by Labor Day.\n\"That would probably include such people as the elderly, residents of nursing homes, health care providers, other people at high risk for chronic illnesses,\" Collins said Thursday.\nBut anti-vaxxers have taken to social media to spread lies about the future coronavirus vaccine. Some include claims it contains monkey brains or that it's a CIA plot to take over the world. Others allege the vaccine will include an invisible trackable tattoo or it will disfigure those who take it.\nAs the lies spread, the government's multi-billion-dollar vaccine effort has yet to come up with a public education campaign to counteract disinformation.\nThe stakes are high. A third of Americans said they'd not get vaccinated against coronavirus, even if the vaccine is widely available and low cost, according to a CNN poll in May. \"Speaking for myself, I think I underestimated the level of public resistance,\" Collins told CNN. \"I didn't expect it to be that widespread.\"\nDr. Tina Hartert of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center said lack of faith in the vaccine can lead to major outbreaks. She described the government's communication on the vaccine as crucial.\n\"We should have started on this months ago but it's never too late to start this important messaging. Because otherwise the messaging people will listen to is the story of one child from another parent,\" Hartert told CNN's Anderson Cooper.\nDr. Mike Ryan, the executive director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Programme, said governments will need to have a \"dialogue\" with their citizens about vaccination.\n\"I think science and government have a job to do that is to make the case,\" Ryan said Thursday. \"I think communities and people have a job to do, which is to listen to that case, and hopefully the result of that will be a widely accepted successful vaccine that could bring this pandemic to an end.\"",

            "HeadLine": "How New Zealand went 100 days with no community coronavirus transmission",
            "Text": "(CNN)New Zealand has marked an enviable milestone -- more than 100 days since its last coronavirus case was acquired locally from an unknown source.\n\nAs of Monday, the country had reported 1,219 confirmed cases, including just 21 active infections, all in managed isolation facilities. No cases had emerged via community transmission in 100 days, authorities announced Sunday, with all new infections coming from abroad.\nIn total, the island nation of 5 million people has reported 22 coronavirus deaths.\nWhile other countries -- including Pacific neighbor Australia and the United States -- continue to battle outbreaks, New Zealand has been held up as an example of how to fight Covid-19. One key reason is that although the country appears to have the coronavirus under control, authorities are still testing thousands of people a day. Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield speaks to media on August 06, 2020 in Wellington, New Zealand.\n\"We have seen overseas how quickly the virus can reemerge and spread in places where it was previously under control,\" Director-General of Health Dr. Ashley Bloomfield said Sunday.\n\"We need to be prepared to quickly stamp out any future cases in New Zealand. Don't let the team down -- none of us can afford to do that.\" How New Zealand did it\nNew Zealand's strategy was simple: in the words of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, the country had to \"go hard, and go early.\"\nWhen Ardern closed the border to foreigners on March 19, the country only had 28 confirmed cases. And when she announced a nationwide lockdown on March 23, there were only 102 confirmed cases -- and no deaths.\nNew Zealand's lockdown was relatively strict -- no takeaways, no beaches, and no driving outside of your neighborhood. The strictest rules were in place for around five weeks, but the country remained under effective lockdown for a further two weeks. That was all part of the country's broader strategy: elimination.\n\"Elimination does not mean eradicating the virus permanently from New Zealand; rather it is being confident we have eliminated chains of transmission in our community for at least 28 days and can effectively contain any future imported cases from overseas,\" according to the Ministry of Health's website.\nNew Zealand waited until it had brought its curve right down before it lifted restrictions. On June 8, when Ardern announced that all restrictions would be lifted, almost 40,000 tests in the previous 17 days hadn't yielded a single positive result.\nSince June, the country has been almost back to normal -- and there hasn't been a need to return to lockdown.\nNew Zealand also coupled the lockdown with tight border restrictions. Only citizens are allowed to enter the country, and they must spend two weeks in a government-approved facility. New Zealanders returning home will now be charged 3,100 New Zealand dollars ($2,040) for the facilities if they return temporarily.\nIn total, 95 confirmed cases have been identified at the border, and 70% of New Zealand's cases were either imported or imported-related cases, according to Ministry of Health statistics.\nWhat New Zealand didn't do\nAround the world, there has been a lot of emphasis on wearing face masks to control the spread of coronavirus.\nBut in New Zealand, masks haven't been a major tool against the outbreak. There's a few reasons for that. The country doesn't have a culture of wearing masks, and in March -- as New Zealand prepared to go into lockdown -- it was difficult to buy masks in local stores. By the time people were able to go out in public and travel around the country again, there were very few coronavirus cases in New Zealand.\nIn addition to New Zealand's public health strategies, the country had a few natural advantages.\nIt has no land borders, giving it more control over who enters the country. And New Zealand is not densely populated -- according to World Bank data, it has only 18 people per square kilometer, compared with 36 in the US and 275 in the United Kingdom. India -- which has the third-highest number of cases in the world -- has 455 people per square kilometer.\nBut just because face masks haven't been part of New Zealand's strategy in the past, doesn't mean that will be the case in the future. The Ministry of Health is recommending that all households prepare for another possible outbreak by stocking up on masks.\n\"It's a matter of when, not if,\" Bloomfield told national broadcaster Radio New Zealand last week, when asked if another community transmission case in New Zealand was inevitable. \"We're working on the basis that it could be at anytime.\"",

            "Text": "(CNN)Many people may be experiencing increased anxiety during the pandemic, which experts say can be compounded by the sense of isolation that can come with social distancing.\n\nThat's why it's important for people who are vulnerable to increased anxiety to have access mental health care, panelists said during an American Lung Association event on Wednesday.\n\"It's also really important to remember that one in five Americans had a diagnosed mental health condition before the pandemic,\" said Ken Duckworth, medical director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Those people still need access to mental health care, he said.\nDuckworth also stressed the importance of telehealth services and phone sessions for people without internet access.\n\"Pain shared is pain halved,\" Duckworth said. Dr. Tyish Hall Brown, a psychiatry and behavioral sciences professor at Howard University College of Medicine, emphasized that people also need to check in on the mental health of children and teens.\n\"Everything's kind of a catastrophic thought\" for teens, she said, and it can be helpful to remind them that this break from in-person classes and seeing friends won't last forever.\nHall Brown advised parents to keep track of changes in their children's behavior and share these observations with a doctor, if they are concerned.\nNationwide, as of Wednesday, almost 5.2 million people have tested positive for the virus and at least 165,924 have died, according to Johns Hopkins.\nWhite House has new guidelines for schools\nAs President Donald Trump continued to call for students to return to classrooms, the White House released eight new recommendations for schools.\nThe recommendations are primarily basic hygiene tips and don't outline what schools should do if they find coronavirus cases in their halls.\nThe broad recommendations are similar to coronavirus mitigation efforts across the country, and not particularly specific to schools. The President said the school strategy mirrors the White House's national approach.\n\"We cannot indefinitely stop 50 million American children from going to school and harming their mental, physical, emotional and academic development and inflicting long-term, lasting damage,\" he told reporters at the White House.\nThe recommendations include ensuring that students and staff \"understand the symptoms of Covid-19\" and requiring \"all students, teachers and staff to self-assess their health every morning before coming to school.\"\nThe recommendations also encourage the use of masks, but do not require students, teachers or staff to wear masks. They also \"require students, teachers and staff to socially distance around high-risk individuals,\" however it's unclear how schools will go about doing that.\nTrump said the federal government will provide up to 125 million masks to school districts around the nation.\nKellyanne Conway, counselor to the President, said earlier that despite the resources the federal government will provide, the decision to reopen schools will still need to be made at a local level.\n\"We're the federal government,\" Conway said. \"We're not telling school districts what to do. We're providing guidance and resources.\"\nOf the 101 largest school districts in the country, 63 will start the academic year remotely.\nSome schools that have reopened have already seen new cases.\nIn Georgia, just outside Atlanta, more than 1,100 students, teachers and staff members in the Cherokee County School District are under quarantine as a result of 59 Covid-19 positive cases or exposure. Schools reopened nine days ago.\nRhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo announced Wednesday the start of school will be pushed back two weeks and specifically said that the photos of crowded Georgia schools were \"a cautionary tale.\"\nOverall cases decline but some regions see rise\nCoronavirus continues to spread at high rates across the US South, Midwest and West, even as the total number of new Covid-19 cases has declined since a summer surge.\nNationally, over the past seven days, the United States is averaging just under 53,000 new cases of Covid-19 per day, down 11% from the week prior. As a result of all those cases, deaths from the virus have remained high. The seven-day average of daily coronavirus deaths was just over 1,000 on Tuesday, the 16th consecutive day the US averaged over 1,000 deaths per day. Wedneday became the 17th day as more than 1,300 deaths were reported.\nAdjusting for population, states in the Southeast are seeing the most new cases. Georgia and Florida -- states led by Republican governors who have not issued face mask requirements -- have the highest per capita new cases over the past seven days, followed by Alabama and Mississippi.\nOn Wednesday, Florida announced more than 8,000 new case reports and 212 new deaths, according to data released by the Florida Department of Health.\nCovid-19 causes worse outcomes for older people, but young people are not immune. In Florida, people under 44 make up about 57% of the state's 545,000 cases, 20% of the state's 31,900 hospitalizations, and 3% of the state's 8,765 deaths, according to state data.\nRobert Ruiz, 31 and the father of a 3-year-old, was one of the 265 people under 44 who died from coronavirus in Florida. His sister, Chenique Mills, told CNN he was overweight and had seasonal asthma but otherwise did not smoke or drink and had no underlying health conditions.\n\"This is all really sudden, unexpected,\" she said. \"I (saw) him on Friday. I (saw) him on Saturday. He was fine, to say that he was up, and he was walking and he was eating. He was functioning. So for him to be gone on Sunday? It's just a lot to take in. \"This virus is so serious. It really, really is. And I think people (won't) understand until it hits home, because I would be one to say that I took it really lightly until it hit home.\"\nThe virus's ongoing spread around the country has frustrated plans to safely reopen schools, forced college football conferences to postpone the lucrative fall season, and caused vast medical and economic pain.\nAnd it will continue to rattle American society until people more seriously adopt recommended public health measures: social distancing, avoiding large indoor gatherings, hand-washing, mask-wearing, rapid testing and quarantining the sick.\n\"We have to figure out how to deal with this as a whole country because as long as there are cases happening in any part, we still have transit, especially now we have students going back to college,\" said Dr. Michael Mina, assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H.

            "Text": "(CNN)The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it has closed several buildings it leases in Atlanta because Legionella bacteria have been found in their water systems -- bacteria that likely grew because of the prolonged pandemic shutdown.\n\nIt's a problem that people across the country need to be on the lookout for, the CDC says. The bacteria, which can cause deadly pneumonia, grow in warm or stagnant water. The plumbing in buildings that have been closed for months because of the coronavirus pandemic could provide a perfect breeding ground for Legionella and other waterborne pathogens, the CDC cautions.\nIt even happened to the CDC itself.\n\"During the recent closures at our leased space in Atlanta, working through the General Services Administration (GSA), CDC directed the landlord to take protective actions,\" the CDC said in a statement to CNN. \"Despite their best efforts, CDC has been notified that Legionella, which can cause Legionnaires' Disease, is present in a cooling tower as well as in some water sources in the buildings. Out of an abundance of caution, we have closed these buildings until successful remediation is complete.\" Legionella bacteria are common in water everywhere. They're usually only a problem when the water gets aerosolized and people breathe it in. Showers and fountains are common sources. The name dates back to 1976, when an outbreak among people at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia affected 182 people and killed 29 of them.\nPeople most at risk include the elderly, smokers, people with suppressed immune systems and diabetics.\nLast year, the CDC reports, 4,294 cases were reported. So far this year, 1,813 cases have been reported. It's not yet clear if the pandemic has worsened the problem, or perhaps eased it because people are not gathering at large hotels or working in big factory buildings as much, said Chris Edens, an epidemiologist on CDC's Legionella team. He said state health departments that normally monitor and report cases of Legionella infection are tied up dealing with coronavirus.\nAnd no national entity systematically checks buildings to see if the bacteria has started growing in the plumbing. \"There is currently no nationwide surveillance of water systems for Legionella disease,\" Edens said.\nAs people return to work and start to travel more, hospitals and clinics need to think about the possibility of Legionella, Edens said. \"Flu and coronavirus are not the only things that can cause severe pneumonia,\" he said. If people turn up with pneumonia, it's worth testing them for Legionella -- especially since it can be treated with antibiotics, unlike flu or coronavirus. Many different buildings could be at risk, and building managers need to be aware during prolonged closures. \"We are talking hotels, we are talking large office buildings, we are even talking certain kinds of factories ... a lot of those buildings have been shut down,\" Edens told CNN.\n\"This water has been sitting and could be at risk of Legionella growth.\"\nPoorly maintained cooling towers are another potential source. The fix is not difficult. \"You want to keep the cold water cold and you want to keep your hot water hot,\" Edens said. Legionella flourishes at temperatures between 80\u00b0 and 120\u00b0 Fahrenheit. It's killed by chlorination and other disinfecting routines, but the bacteria can grow into mats that create hard-to-dislodge sludge inside pipes, Edens said.\n\"One of the things that we typically recommend in buildings that have been disused is flushing,\" he said.\n\"That can be as simple as turning the faucet on. Let cold or hot water course through the system. Keep that water moving.\"\nLegionella is not the only risk, by the way. \"There's lots of different waterborne pathogens,\" Edens said. \"There are certainly other bugs out there.\" The CDC warns about them on its website.\n\"These can include other microbial hazards, such as non-tuberculous mycobacteria, changes in water chemistry that lead to corrosion, leaching of metals (such as lead) into stagnant water, disinfection by-products, and sewer gases that enter buildings through dry sanitary sewer drain traps,\" it says.",

That has led federal officials to set up new testing sites in Florida, Louisiana and Texas. But major diagnostic companies have said they are facing testing delays. Hospitals in Texas and Florida are flooded with critical Covid-19 patients and some local and state officials have made face coverings mandatory.\nLast week, the country averaged just under 50,000 new cases daily -- the highest rate recorded, and twice as high as a month ago.\nTexas reported more than 10,000 new cases on Tuesday, marking the highest single day total in the state since the pandemic began.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said Tuesday the death rate among coronavirus patients has lowered but Americans shouldn't take comfort in it. \"It's a false narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death,\" Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during a livestream with Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama. \"There's so many other things that are very dangerous and bad about this virus, don't get yourself into false complacency.\"\nMore than 131,200 people in the US have died from coronavirus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\nAn influential coronavirus model often cited by the White House increased its projections for US deaths on Tuesday and it's now forecasting more than 208,000 deaths by November.\nLive coronavirus updates\nBut face masks could save as many as 45,000 US lives by November if 95% of the population wears a covering in public, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, which built the model.\n\"It's an incredibly simple strategy and intervention,\" Chris Murray, director of the IHME, told CNN. \"It's one that will save lives, but it will also help the economy enormously because it will avoid shutdowns which will inevitably come when things get quickly out of control in some states.\"\nCalifornia hospitalizations at all-time high\nNearly 6,000 coronavirus patients are hospitalized in California -- the highest number since the pandemic began -- and the state is seeing a record number of Covid-19 patients in ICUs, according to data from California Department of Public Health.\nCalifornia is only one of several states that are reporting record numbers of hospitalizations. Medical facilities in Florida, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina are being overrun by the surge of cases.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Tuesday that officials are sending 100 nurses and adding nearly 50 beds to Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital. The facility has 345 Covid-19 patients with 25% of them in the ICU, the governor said.\nIn Florida, at least 43 hospitals across 21 counties -- including Miami-Dade, Broward, Hillsborough and Orange counties -- have hit capacity and show zero ICU beds available, according to data released by the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA).\nIn Texas, Houston's United Memorial Medical Center is seeing a rising number of patients that need a ventilator, chief medical officer Dr. Joseph Varon said Tuesday.\nMedical staff there are \"putting in anywhere between 16 to 20 hours a day,\" Varon told CNN.\nLina Hidalgo, judge of Texas' Harris County, which includes Houston, is wants a stay-at-home order in her county as coronavirus cases rise. A patchwork method, she said, won't quell the virus in the long run.\n\"A long-term solution based on data instead of wishful thinking is what's going to put our economy in the position to succeed,\" Hidalgo told CNN's Kate Bolduan on Tuesday.\nIn Texas' Rio Grande Valley, a hospital in the city of Weslaco set up tent outside to help deal with an influx of Covid-19 patients, CNN affiliate KVEO reported.\nThe 25-foot tent is meant to help South Texas Health System emergency room doctors treat and additional 20 coronavirus patients, adding to the 14 that the facility could otherwise handle.\n\"We are trying to reserve out in-house ER for the sicker patients,\" hospital director Pablo Laredo told KVEO on Monday.\nMichigan governor calls for 'mask-up campaign'\nAt least 31 states have showed an upward trend in average new daily cases -- an increase of at least 10% -- over the last seven days, as of Tuesday morning, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Those states are: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Washington state, West Virginia and Wisconsin.\nOnly four states have seen average daily cases decline more than 10% over those seven days: Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island.\nOne of the main drivers of cases now could be \"silent spreaders,\" or people who are asymptomatic or presymptomatic, according to a new study. The report, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that asymptomatic or presymptomatic hosts could be responsible for half of cases.\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Tuesday called for a \"national mask-up campaign,\" saying it is necessary for everyone to wear masks to stem the spread of the coronavirus.\n\"I think that if everyone endorsed this, it's a simple, cost-effective thing that we could do to really mitigate spread,\" Whitmer told CNN's \"New Day.\"\nAfter weeks of health officials encouraging the public to wear face masks, at least 35 states along with Washington DC and Puerto Rico have implemented face covering requirements to help mitigate the virus' spread.

It causes headaches, dizziness, muscle aches, stomach pain and other symptoms along with classic respiratory symptoms like coughing and fever.\n\"Physicians need to think of COVID-19 as a multisystem disease,\" said Dr. Aakriti Gupta, a cardiology fellow at Columbia who worked on the review, in a statement. \"There's a lot of news about clotting but it's also important to understand that a substantial proportion of these patients suffer kidney, heart, and brain damage, and physicians need to treat those conditions along with the respiratory disease.\" Much of the damage wrought by the virus appears to come because of its affinity for a receptor \u2014 a kind of molecular doorway into cells \u2014 called ACE2. Cells lining the blood vessels, in the kidneys, the liver ducts, the pancreas, in the intestinal tract and lining the respiratory tract all are covered with ACE2 receptors, which the virus can use to grapple and infect cells, the Columbia team wrote in their review, published in the journal Nature Medicine.\n\"These findings suggest that multiple-organ injury may occur at least in part due to direct viral tissue damage,\" the team wrote. Coronavirus infection also activates the immune system. Part of that response includes the production of inflammatory proteins called cytokines. This inflammation can damage cells and organs and the so-called cytokine storm is one of the causes of severe symptoms. \"This virus is unusual and it's hard not to take a step back and not be impressed by how many manifestations it has on the human body,\" Dr. Mahesh Madhavan, another cardiology fellow who worked on the review, said in a statement,\nBlood clotting effects appear to be caused by several different mechanisms: direct damage of the cells lining the blood vessels and interference with the various clotting mechanisms in the blood itself. Low blood oxygen caused by pneumonia can make the blood more likely to clot, the researchers said.\nThese clots can cause strokes and heart attacks or can lodge in the lungs or legs. They clog the kidneys and interfere with dialysis treatments needed for the sickest patients. Damage to the pancreas can worsen diabetes, and patients with diabetes have been shown to be at the highest risk of severe illness and death from coronavirus.\nThe virus can directly damage the brain, but some of the neurological effects likely come from the treatment. \"COVID-19 patients can be intubated for two to three weeks; a quarter require ventilators for 30 or more days,\" Gupta said.\n\"These are very prolonged intubations, and patients need a lot of sedation. 'ICU delirium' was a well-known condition before COVID, and the hallucinations may be less an effect of the virus and more an effect of the prolonged sedation.\"\nThe virus affects the immune system, depleting the T-cells the body usually deploys to fight off viral infections. \"Lymphopenia, a marker of impaired cellular immunity, is a cardinal laboratory finding reported in 67-90% of patients with COVID-19,\" the researchers wrote. Doctors need to treat all of these effects when coronavirus patients show up in the hospital, the Columbia team said.\nThere is some good news.\n\"Gastrointestinal symptoms may be associated with a longer duration of illness but have not been associated with increased mortality,\" the researchers wrote. Many of the skin effects, such as rashes and purplish, swollen \"Covid toes,\" also clear up on their own.",

            "HeadLine": "Birx warns 9 cities, California's central valley about increasing coronavirus cases",
            "Text": "(CNN)The White House coronavirus task force is warning states about an uptick in coronavirus test positivity rates in a number of new cities this week.\n\nTask force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said there are encouraging signs across the South, a region hit hard by a surging pandemic in recent weeks, but she outlined new areas of concern in a private phone call with state and local officials Wednesday, according to a recording of the call obtained by the journalism non-profit Center for Public Integrity.\n\"We are concerned that both Baltimore and Atlanta remain at a very high level,\" Birx said on the call. \"Kansas City, Portland, Omaha, of course what we talked about in the Central Valley (in California).\" \"We are seeing a slow uptick in test positivity in cases in places like Chicago, Boston and Detroit and DC,\" she said, adding that the virus has entered a new phase.\n\"This outbreak is different from the March, April outbreak in that it's in both rural and urban areas,\" Birx said.\nBirx told CNN on Sunday that the deadly virus is now more \"extraordinarily widespread\" than it was in the early days of the pandemic.\nIn Wednesday's call, she said the concern last week centered on increasing numbers in Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois and Virginia.\n\"Although we're seeing improvements in some of the red states and some of the states have actually moved from being in a red category -- that was more than 10% test positivity -- to under 10%, Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia moved back into the yellow states status,\" Birx said. \"Their work needs to continue to intensify to continue to bring down case counts.\" Now, Birx said, Nebraska and California have moved into the red category, with more than 10% of tests coming back positive. She said Los Angeles may have seen improvements but that there's significant movement of the virus up California's Central Valley.\nDespite Birx's quick reference to 10% positive test rates, it's not entirely clear which states the task force has designated as \"red,\" \"yellow\" or \"green,\" how often that label may change or what the criteria may be for the designation because the panel hasn't released the information on the classification system.\nIn another private call last month, Birx warned of a concerning rise in coronavirus cases in 12 cities, including Miami, New Orleans, Las Vegas, San Jose, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, Cleveland, Nashville, Pittsburgh, Columbus and Baltimore.\nFauci: Test positivity upticks are a 'predictor of trouble ahead'\nBy alerting officials to upticks in positivity rates in the nine cities and California's Central Valley, Birx essentially was warning those areas to act now to prevent an undesirable surge in cases, another member of the White House task force told CNN on Thursday. Test positivity rates can give early indication that a surge in daily case counts will come if nothing is done, Dr. Anthony Fauci said.\n\"It's a pretty good predictor, usually before people become aware of it,\" Fauci told CNN's \"New Day.\"\n\"So what Dr. Birx is saying, is now is the time to accelerate the fundamental preventative measures that we all talk about: Masks, social distancing, avoiding crowds, outdoors greater than indoors, washing hands, et cetera.\n\"Those kinds of simple things can actually prevent that uptick from becoming a surge. So she was warning the states and the cities to be careful, because this is a predictor of trouble ahead.\"\nBirx said Wednesday that she has crisscrossed the country over the past five or six weeks, driving about 6,000 miles, and has seen a few trends for herself.\n\"We've really seen that America is on the move and people are going on vacation,\" she said. She urged officials on the call to draw attention in their state to the dangers of exposing older family members to returning vacationers because of wide asymptomatic spread. Birx again blamed \"super spreader\" events for driving the virus and said mitigation efforts should continue.\nBirx ended Wednesday's call on a hopeful note.\n\"We are watching each county, each city across the United States very carefully and are providing the best advice we have based on models ... showing that these mitigation efforts are working,\" she said.",

            "HeadLine": "US tops 1,000 coronavirus deaths 4 days in a row as experts urge the country to shut down",
            "Text": "(CNN)As more Covid-19 records get broken, debates on whether to send kids back to school or to shut down the economy again are coming to a head.\n\nMore than 1,000 people died every day for four straight days last week due to Covid-19. That brings the total US death toll from the virus to more than 146,000 as of Sunday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. And researchers project up to 175,000 deaths linked to the virus by August 15, according to an ensemble forecast published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With overwhelmed hospitals and lengthy delays in testing, some local leaders -- including Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti -- said a second stay-at-home order might be possible.\nThat kind of drastic measure is supported by more than 150 prominent medical experts, scientists, teachers, nurses and other experts who signed a letter urging leaders to shut the country down and start over to contain the rampant spread of the virus.\n\"Right now, we are on a path to lose more than 200,000 American lives by November 1st. Yet, in many states people can drink in bars, get a haircut, eat inside a restaurant, get a tattoo, get a massage, and do myriad other normal, pleasant, but non-essential activities,\" read the letter, which was sent to the Trump administration, members of Congress and state governors.\nWhat we can learn from states that got Covid-19 under control\nIn the past two days, these states broke records:\nAs the country's caseload and death toll climbs, at least four states reported record-breaking numbers since Friday. California, which is leading the nation with the most recorded coronavirus cases, reported 159 deaths linked to the virus Friday -- the highest number recorded in a single day since the start of the pandemic. More than half of all virus-related deaths in the state come from Los Angeles County, where more than 4,260 deaths have been reported. The state has had more than 446,450 reported infections, according to Johns Hopkins.\nGeorgia also broke a new single-day record Friday, reporting at least 4,813 new coronavirus cases. Health officials reported 3,787 new cases Saturday. More than 165,180 people have tested positive in the state, according to Johns Hopkins.\nOregon reported nine new coronavirus-related deaths Friday, breaking its record for most reported fatalities in a single day since the pandemic began. Health officials in the state reported 396 new cases, bringing the state's total to more than 16,100.\nFor the second day in a row, Hawaii reported a record number of new cases, identifying 60 new positive tests Friday, according to health officials. On Thursday, Hawaii reported 55 new cases. the state has had at least 1,620 reported infections, according to Johns Hopkins.\nTrack the virus in your state and across the US\nFlorida's youngest victim was a 9-year-old girl\nIn Florida, a state that's broken its record of new cases several times in recent weeks, Covid-19 hospitalizations have jumped by nearly 80% since July 4, according to data from the state's Agency for Health Care Administration. Across the state, at least 50 hospitals have no ICU beds available.\nLast week, a 9-year-old girl with no pre-existing conditions became the state's youngest coronavirus victim. Kimora \"Kimmie\" Lynum was taken to a local hospital to treat a \"very high\" fever, her family said.\nKimmie's cousin and family spokesman Dejeon Cain said the hospital told the family to return home. After doing so, the young girl complained of not feeling well and collapsed, Cain said. She didn't have a detectable heartbeat.\nHer family said they don't know how Kimmie contracted the virus, as she had appeared healthy and had spent the summer at home.\nTexas hospital could send patients home to die\nIn Texas, which broke a record for virus-related deaths last week, doctors inside one hospital may decide to send patients home to \"die by their loved ones\" due to limited resources, officials said. Officials in Starr County announced they're creating committees to review patients' cases at the Starr County Memorial Hospital -- where at least 50% of patients admitted to the hospital's emergency room have tested positive for coronavirus.\n\"Unfortunately, Starr County Memorial Hospital has limited resources and our doctors are going to have to decide who receives treatment, and who is sent home to die by their loved ones,\" Starr County Judge Eloy Vera wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday. \"This is what we did not want our community to experience.\"\nEarlier this month, the governor ordered a statewide mask mandate and urged residents to heed the precautions in order for businesses and the economy to remain open.\nAs the state grapples with coronavirus, Gov. Greg Abbott also had to issue a disaster declaration for 32 counties after Hurricane Hanna made landfall Saturday evening.\nCDC in favor of reopening schools\nMany teachers and staff members across the US have strongly opposed returning to classrooms next month as the virus runs uncontrolled across American communities. But some parents -- including some in a Georgia county where coronavirus numbers are among the highest in the state -- are demanding schools reopen.\nPresident Donald Trump has said he's putting pressure on governors to reopen schools in a push to get the US back to business as usual.\nIn new guidelines posted last week on education and childcare, the CDC came down hard in favor of reopening schools, saying children don't suffer much from coronavirus and are less likely to spread it.\nBut research from South Korea found that older children (between the ages of 10 and 19) can transmit the coronavirus within a household just as much as adults.\nThe CDC guidelines recommended local officials consider closing schools -- or keeping them closed -- if there is substantial, uncontrolled spread of the virus.\n\"It is critically important for our public health to open schools this fall,\" CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said.\n\"School closures have disrupted normal ways of life for children and parents, and they have had negative health consequences on our youth. CDC is prepared to work with K-12 schools to safely reopen while protecting the most vulnerable.\"",
