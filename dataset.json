            "Text": "As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the United States Government (USG) is innovating and taking a new approach to help keep international air passengers healthy. The new, more effective strategy focuses on the continuum of travel and the individual passenger, including pre-departure and post-arrival education, efforts to develop a potential testing framework with international partners, and illness response. This strategy is consistent with the current phase of the pandemic and more effectively protects the health of the American public.\n\nBeginning September 14, 2020, the USG will remove requirements for directing all flights carrying airline passengers arriving from, or recently had a presence in, certain countries to land at one of 15 designated airports and halt enhanced entry health screening for these passengers. Currently, enhanced entry health screening is conducted for those arriving from, or with recent presence in, China (excluding the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau), Iran, the Schengen region of Europe, the United Kingdom (excluding overseas territories outside of Europe), Ireland, and Brazil.\n\nWe now have a better understanding of COVID-19 transmission that indicates symptom-based screening has limited effectiveness because people with COVID-19 may have no symptoms or fever at the time of screening, or only mild symptoms. Transmission of the virus may occur from passengers who have no symptoms or who have not yet developed symptoms of infection. Therefore, CDC is shifting its strategy and prioritizing other public health measures to reduce the risk of travel-related disease transmission.\n\nUSG resources will instead be dedicated to more effective mitigation efforts that focus on the individual passenger, including: pre-departure, in-flight, and post-arrival health education for passengers; robust illness response at airports; voluntary collection of contact information from passengers using electronic means as proposed by some airlines to avoid long lines, crowding and delays associated with manual data collection; potential testing to reduce the risk of travel-related transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 and movement of the virus from one location to another; country-specific risk assessments to assist passengers in making informed decisions about travel-related risk; enhancing training and education of partners in the transportation sector and at United States ports of entry to ensure recognition of illness and immediate notification to CDC; and post-arrival passenger recommendations for self-monitoring and precautions to protect others, with enhanced precautions, including staying home to the extent possible for 14 days for people arriving from high-risk destinations.\n\nBy refocusing our mitigation efforts on individual passenger risk throughout the air travel journey, the USG can most effectively protect the health of the American public.",

            "HeadLine": "Timing of State and Territorial COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Orders and Changes in Population Movement \u2014 United States, March 1\u2013May 31, 2020",
            "Text": "SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is thought to spread from person to person primarily by the respiratory route and mainly through close contact (1). Community mitigation strategies can lower the risk for disease transmission by limiting or preventing person-to-person interactions (2). U.S. states and territories began implementing various community mitigation policies in March 2020. One widely implemented strategy was the issuance of orders requiring persons to stay home, resulting in decreased population movement in some jurisdictions (3). Each state or territory has authority to enact its own laws and policies to protect the public\u2019s health, and jurisdictions varied widely in the type and timing of orders issued related to stay-at-home requirements. To identify the broader impact of these stay-at-home orders, using publicly accessible, anonymized location data from mobile devices, CDC and the Georgia Tech Research Institute analyzed changes in population movement relative to stay-at-home orders issued during March 1\u2013May 31, 2020, by all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories.* During this period, 42 states and territories issued mandatory stay-at-home orders. When counties subject to mandatory state- and territory-issued stay-at-home orders were stratified along rural-urban categories, movement decreased significantly relative to the preorder baseline in all strata. Mandatory stay-at-home orders can help reduce activities associated with the spread of COVID-19, including population movement and close person-to-person contact outside the household.\n\nData on state and territorial stay-at-home orders were obtained from government websites containing executive or administrative orders or press releases for each jurisdiction. Each order was analyzed and coded into one of five mutually exclusive categories: 1) mandatory for all persons; 2) mandatory only for persons in certain areas of the jurisdiction; 3) mandatory only for persons at increased risk in the jurisdiction; 4) mandatory only for persons at increased risk in certain areas of the jurisdiction; or 5) advisory or recommendation (i.e., nonmandatory). Jurisdictions that did not issue an order were coded as having no state- or territory-issued order.\u2020 These data underwent secondary review and quality assurance checks and were published in a freely available data set (4).\n\nPublicly accessible, anonymized location data from mobile devices were obtained to estimate county-level raw data regarding movement (5). Population movement was estimated by computing the percentage of individual mobile devices (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, or watches) reporting each day that were completely at home (i.e., had not moved beyond a 150-meter radius of its common nighttime location) within a given county, using a 7-day rolling average to smooth each county\u2019s pre- and postorder time series values. This analysis used four types of order index dates, based only on mandatory orders: 1) the start date of each state or territorial stay-at-home order for each county in that jurisdiction; 2) the relaxation or expiration date of each state or territorial stay-at-home order for each county in that jurisdiction; 3) the effective date of the first state-issued stay-at-home order (i.e., California); and 4) the first date a state-issued stay-at-home order ended (i.e., Alaska).\u00a7\n\nTo assess changes in movement when mandatory state or territorial stay-at-home orders went into effect and ended, counties were first stratified along rural-urban categories to ensure that counties with similar population sizes were grouped together.\u00b6 A box plot was constructed for each rural-urban category to examine the distribution of county mean percentages of devices at home during the pre- and postorder periods associated with each index date. Because it was not assumed that movement values follow a normal distribution for all counties and periods, a clustered Wilcoxon signed rank test was then performed for each stratum, with counties as clusters, on the constituent counties\u2019 median pre- and postorder values associated with each index date. A lower-tailed test was used for index dates related to the start of state and territorial orders, and an upper-tailed test was used for index dates related to the end of state and territorial orders** (6). Strata-level statistical significance was assessed at the 99% confidence level (\u03b1 = 0.01). Analyses were performed using Python (version 3.6; Python Software Foundation) and R (version 3.5; The R Foundation). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.\u2020\u2020\n\nDuring March 1\u2013May 31, 42 states and territories issued mandatory stay-at-home orders, affecting 2,355 (73%) of 3,233 U.S. counties (Figure 1). The first territorial order was issued by Puerto Rico (March 15), and the first state order by California (March 19). Eight jurisdictions issued only an advisory order or recommendation to stay home, and six did not issue any stay-at-home orders. Most jurisdictions issued multiple orders during the observation period, and coding varied among individual orders. The duration and termination of each order varied by jurisdiction. During the observation period, 22 jurisdictions transitioned from a mandatory order to an advisory order, 11 rescinded or allowed orders to expire without extending, and the order in one jurisdiction was ruled invalid by the state\u2019s supreme court.\u00a7\u00a7 The first state to rescind or allow a stay-at-home order to expire was Alaska (April 24). Eight jurisdictions had mandatory orders applicable to at least some part of the population that extended beyond May 31.\n\nDifferences in county-level mean population movement during the pre- and postorder periods varied by index date and rural-urban strata (Figure 2). Decreased median population movement was observed in 2,295 (97.6%) of the 2,351 counties for which population movement data were available. Mandatory stay-at-home orders were associated with decreased population movement (i.e., higher median percentage of devices at home) during the 28-day period after the order start date, relative to the baseline 28-day period before the order start date. This relationship was significant in all rural-urban strata (Supplementary Table, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/92406). Among the 2,355 counties subject to mandatory stay-at-home orders, 436 (19%) had an order that expired on or before May 3, which is the latest possible expiration date that allows for a 28-day postorder observation period.\u00b6\u00b6 Movement significantly increased (i.e., lower median percentage of devices at home) in the period immediately after the expiration or lifting of orders in all rural-urban strata.\n\nThe 14-day period immediately after the first state stay-at-home order was issued in the United States was associated with a significant decrease in movement in all rural-urban strata relative to the 14-day period immediately preceding its implementation.*** The period after the first state relaxed a stay-at-home order was associated with increased population movement at the strata level among states or territories that had not relaxed a stay-at-home order in the same period.\u2020\u2020\u2020\n\nTop\n\nDiscussion\nBased on location data from mobile devices, in 97.6% of counties with mandatory stay-at-home orders issued by states or territories, these orders were associated with decreased median population movement after the order start date, relative to the period before the order was implemented. Reduced population movement helps prevent close contact among persons outside the household, potentially limiting exposure to persons infected with SARS-CoV-2. This suggests that stay-at-home orders can help protect the public\u2019s health by limiting potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and reducing community transmission of COVID-19.\n\nThe implementation of stay-at-home orders might affect population movement differently depending on when and where orders are issued and to whom they apply. The observed decrease in population movement after the implementation of the first state-issued mandatory stay-at-home order in California suggests that the implementation of certain public health policies might influence behaviors in other areas, in addition to persons directly subject to the action. However, this observation occurred in the context of other variables, which might have influenced behaviors, including the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic, declaration of national or state emergencies, media attention to fatalities and increased demands on hospitals, gathering bans, closures of schools and businesses, and cancellation of sporting events.\n\nIncreases in population movement were evident among counties in jurisdictions where stay-at-home orders were lifted, as well as in other communities as orders began to lift nationwide. Such increases might be driven in part by persons resuming preorder movement behaviors in response to the lifting of orders where they lived, or in response to perceived reduced risk associated with the lifting of orders elsewhere. Many other factors might have also played a role, and additional studies are needed to determine which factors caused population movement to increase across jurisdictions after the first state stay-at-home order ended.\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\n\nFurther research is needed to assess the impact of reduced population movement and other community mitigation strategies on the spread of COVID-19. For example, understanding the relationship between stay-at-home orders in contiguous counties and movement might explain how same-state and neighboring-state policy changes can affect public health by mitigating or exacerbating external environmental and social factors affecting population movement.\u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 As the pandemic continues and jurisdictions consider reimplementing mitigation policies, additional studies are needed to assess the impact of reissuing stay-at-home orders.\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, although relative device coverage largely correlates with U.S. population density, some regions or demographic groups might be over- or underrepresented.**** Second, persons might have multiple mobile devices and might not take certain devices with them when they leave the home (e.g., tablets) or might take multiple devices with them simultaneously (e.g., phones and smart watches). Third, although the clustered Wilcoxon signed rank test is used with counties as clusters because each county\u2019s median pre- and postorder values are paired comparisons rather than independent observations, potential spatial dependence among counties is not addressed. Fourth, this report does not assess whether population movement was affected by nationwide protests during the observation period.\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 Finally, this report analyzes the relationship between stay-at-home orders and population movement and does not assess the complex relationship between stay-at-home orders and illness incidence rates or deaths.\n\nMandatory stay-at-home orders can help reduce activities associated with community spread of COVID-19, including population movement and close person-to-person contact outside the household. Mandatory stay-at-home orders were associated with reduced population movement in most counties during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the relaxation of those orders was associated with increased movement. Although stay-at-home orders might assist in limiting potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and have had public support (7), such orders substantially disrupt daily life and have resulted in adverse economic impact (8). Further studies are needed to assess the timing and conditions under which stay-at-home orders might be best used to protect health, minimize negative impacts, and ensure equitable enforcement of community mitigation policies. These findings can inform public policies to potentially slow the spread of COVID-19 and control other communicable diseases in the future.",

            "Text": "Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 is intended to identify current infection in individuals and is performed when a person has signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19, or when a person is asymptomaticexternal icon but has recent known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Examples of diagnostic testing include testing symptomatic persons, testing persons identified through contact tracing efforts, and testing those who indicate that they were exposed to someone with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19. See CDC\u2019s Overview of Testing for SARS-CoV-2. The US. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) FAQs on Testing for SARS-CoV-2external icon also address diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nDefinition of Screening Testing\n\nScreening testing for SARS-CoV-2 is intended to identify infected persons who are asymptomatic and without known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Screening testing is performed to identify persons who may be contagious so that measures can be taken to prevent further transmission. Examples of screening include testing in congregate settings, such as a long-term care facility or a correctional facility, a workplace testing its employees, or a school testing its students, faculty, and staff. See CDC\u2019s Overview of Testing for SARS-CoV-2, Testing Guidelines for Nursing Homes, Interim Considerations for K-12 School Administrators for SARS-CoV-2 Testing, Considerations for Non-Healthcare Workplaces, and Interim Guidance on Management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional and Detention Facilities. FDA\u2019s FAQs on Testing for SARS-CoV-2external icon also address screening testing for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nDefinition of Surveillance Testing\n\nPublic health surveillance is the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data essential to planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice. See CDC\u2019s Introduction to Public Health Surveillance. Surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 is intended to monitor for a community- or population-level infection and disease, or to characterize the incidence and prevalence of disease. Surveillance testing is used to gain information at a population level, rather than an individual level, and results of surveillance testing are only returned in aggregate to the requesting institution. Surveillance testing is performed on de-identified specimens, and thus results are not linked to individuals. Surveillance testing does not involve returning a diagnostic test result to an individual, or for individual decision-making. An example of surveillance testing is a plan developed by a state public health department to randomly select and sample a percentage of all persons in a city on a rolling basis to assess local infection rates and trends. See CDC\u2019s Overview of Testing for SARS-CoV-2. FDA\u2019s FAQs on Testing for SARS-CoV-2external icon also addresses surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nRapid Antigen Testing for SARS-CoV-2\nGeneral Guidance\n\nRapid antigen tests are commonly used in the diagnosis of respiratory pathogens, including influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The FDA has granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for antigen tests that can identify SARS-CoV-2. See FDA\u2019s list of In Vitro Diagnostics EUAsexternal icon.\n\nAntigen tests are immunoassays that detect the presence of a specific viral antigen, which implies current viral infection. Antigen tests are currently authorized to be performed on nasopharyngeal or nasal swab specimens placed directly into the assay\u2019s extraction buffer or reagent. The currently authorized antigen tests are not restricted to use on persons of a certain age. See Table 2 for additional information about antigen tests.\n\nAntigen tests are relatively inexpensive and can be used at the point-of-care. The currently authorized devices return results in approximately 15 minutes. Antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 are generally less sensitive than viral tests that detect nucleic acid using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). See FDA\u2019s list of In Vitro Diagnostics EUAsexternal icon for more information about the performance of specific authorized tests. Proper interpretation of antigen test results is important for accurate clinical management of patients with suspected COVID-19, or for identification of potentially infected persons when used for screening.\n\nThe clinical performance of rapid antigen diagnostic tests largely depends on the circumstances in which they are used. Rapid antigen tests perform best when the person is tested in the early stages of infection with SARS-CoV-2 when viral load is generally highest. They also may be informative in diagnostic testing situations in which the person has a known exposure to a confirmed case of COVID-19. Rapid antigen tests can be used for screening testing in high-risk congregate settings in which repeat testing could quickly identify persons with a SARS-CoV-2 infection to inform infection prevention and control measures, thus preventing transmission. In this case, there may be value in providing immediate results with antigen tests even though they may have lower sensitivity than RT-PCR tests, especially in settings where a rapid turnaround time is required. See FDA\u2019s FAQs on screening asymptomatic individuals and use of antigen tests in high risk congregate settingsexternal icon.\n\nThere are limited data to guide the use of rapid antigen tests as screening tests on asymptomatic persons to detect or exclude COVID-19, or to determine whether a previously confirmed case is still infectious.\n\nClinicians should understand antigen test performance characteristics in order to recognize potentially false negative or false positive results and to guide patient management. Laboratory and testing professionals who perform rapid antigen tests should also understand the factors that affect the accuracy of antigen testing, as described in this guidance.\n\nRegulatory Requirements for Using Rapid Antigen Tests for SARS-CoV-2\n\nFDA regulates in vitro diagnostic devices and has provided recommendations and information regarding EUA requests for COVID-19 diagnostic tests in the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests During the Public Health Emergency (Revised) (\u201cPolicy for COVID-19 Tests\u201d)external icon and the EUA templates referenced in that policy. COVID-19 assays and test systems used for diagnostic or screening testing, including those for antigen testing, must have received an EUA from FDA or be offered under the policies in FDA\u2019s Policy for COVID-19 Testsexternal icon. Any rapid antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 authorized for use by FDA will be included on FDA\u2019s list of In Vitro Diagnostics EUAsexternal icon.\n\nLaboratory and testing professionals who conduct diagnostic or screening testing for SARS-CoV-2 with rapid antigen tests must also comply with Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations. Any laboratory or testing site that intends to report patient-specific test results must first obtain a CLIA certificate and meet all requirements to perform that testing. For more information, see the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Service\u2019s (CMS) summary of the CLIA regulationspdf iconexternal icon. CMS has provided additional information on enforcement discretion for the use of SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care antigen tests on asymptomatic individuals on its websitepdf iconexternal icon.\n\nLaboratory and testing professionals who conduct surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 with rapid antigen tests are not obligated to comply with these FDA and CLIA requirements. However, CDC recommends that facilities that conduct surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 with antigen tests should use an antigen test that has been authorized for use, which are listed on FDA\u2019s In Vitro Diagnostics EUAsexternal icon. Information on surveillance testing performed by Universitiespdf iconexternal icon may be found on the CMS website.\n\nCollection and Handling of Clinical Specimens\n\nAll testing for SARS-CoV-2, including rapid antigen testing, is directly impacted by the integrity of the specimen, which depends on specimen collection and handling. Improper specimen collection may cause some swabs to have limited amounts of viral genetic or antigenic material for detection. Inadequate quality assurance procedures could result in cross contamination of the specimen, which could cause inaccurate test results. Delays from sample collection to testing should be minimized. Biosafety measures and instructions for use should be followed precisely to ensure accurate testing and safety of those who perform the testing. See CDC\u2019s guidance on Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens for COVID-19.\n\nSome antigen assays have explored the use of viral transport media, but the introduction of this dilution may decrease the sensitivity of the assay and carries the risk of cross contamination that can cause false-positive results. Laboratories and testing sites should follow the instructions for use and the package insert that are specific for the test system that they are using.\n\nPerformance of Rapid Antigen Tests for SARS-CoV-2\n\nIt is important for clinicians and testing personnel to understand the performance characteristics, including analytic sensitivity and specificity, of the particular rapid antigen test being used, and to follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and package insert.\n\nThe \u201cgold standard\u201d for clinical diagnostic detection of SARS-CoV-2 remains RT-PCR. Thus, it may be necessary to confirm a rapid antigen test result with a nucleic acid test, especially if the result of the antigen test is inconsistent with the clinical context. When confirming an antigen test result with a RT-PCR test, it is important that the time interval between collection of samples for the two tests is less than two days, and there have not been any opportunities for new exposures between them. If more than two days separate the two collections, or if there have been opportunities for new exposures, the nucleic acid test should be considered a separate test \u2013 not a confirmatory test. Table 2 summarizes the differences between RT-PCR tests and antigen tests.\n\nThe sensitivity of rapid antigen tests is generally lower than RT-PCR. The first antigen tests to have received FDA EUAs demonstrate sensitivity ranging from 84.0%-97.6% compared to RT-PCR. Antigen levels in specimens collected beyond 5-7 days of the onset of symptoms may drop below the limit of detection of the test. This may result in a negative test result, while a more sensitive test, such as RT-PCR, may return a positive result.\n\nThe specificity of rapid antigen tests is generally as high as RT-PCR \u2013 the first antigen tests that have received FDA EUAs have reported specificity of 100% \u2013 which means that false positive results are unlikely. Positive and negative predictive values of all in vitro diagnostic tests vary depending upon the pretest probability of the patient being tested. Pretest probability is impacted by the prevalence of the target infection in the community as well as the clinical context of the recipient of the test. Table 3 provides additional information on the relationship between pretest probability and the likelihood of positive and negative predictive values.\n\nCDC recommends that laboratory and testing professionals who perform rapid antigen testing should determine infection prevalence based on a rolling average of the positivity rate of their own SARS-CoV-2 testing over the previous 7\u201310 days. Infection prevalence at the time of testing, as well as the clinical context of the recipient of the test, impacts pretest probability. If a specific testing site, such as a nursing home, has a positivity rate near zero, the prevalence of disease in the community (e.g., cases per population) should instead be used to help determine pretest probability. Rapid antigen tests should be interpreted in the context of the prevalence of infection or disease, the device\u2019s performance characteristics and instructions for use, and the patient\u2019s clinical signs, symptoms, and history.\n\nEvaluating the Results of Rapid Antigen Testing for SARS-CoV-2\n\nEvaluating the results of a rapid antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 should take into account the performance characteristics (e.g. sensitivity, specificity), instructions for use of the FDA-authorized assay, the prevalence of COVID-19 in that particular community (positivity rate over the previous 7-10 days or cases per population), and the clinical and epidemiological context of the person who has been tested.\n\nThe evaluation of a diagnostic antigen test result should consider the length of time the patient has experienced symptoms. Generally, clinicians can rely upon a positive diagnostic antigen test result because the specificity of current FDA-authorized antigen tests is high in a person who has COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nThe sensitivity of current FDA-authorized antigen tests varies, and thus negative diagnostic testing results should be handled differently depending on the testing device and its stated performance characteristics. In most cases, negative antigen diagnostic test results are considered presumptive. CDC recommends confirming negative antigen test results with an RT-PCR test when the pretest probability is relatively high, especially if the patient is symptomatic or has a known exposure to a person confirmed to have COVID-19. Ideally, confirmatory RT-PCR testing should take place within two days of the initial antigen testing. If RT-PCR testing is not available, clinical discretion can be used in whether to recommend the patient isolate. See CDC\u2019s guidance on Quarantine and Isolation, Discontinuation of Isolation for Persons with COVID-19 Not in Healthcare Settings, Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions of Patients in Healthcare Settings, and Return to Work for Healthcare Personnel. CDC does not recommend using antigen tests to make decisions about discontinuing isolation.\n\nCurrently, the rapid antigen tests that have received EUAs from FDA are authorized for diagnostic testing on symptomatic persons within the first five to seven days of symptom onset. See FDA\u2019s In Vitro Diagnostics EUAsexternal icon in addition to information from CMS on enforcement discretion for the use of SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care antigen diagnostic testing on asymptomatic individualspdf iconexternal icon. Serial antigen testing within a closed congregate setting, such as a long-term care facility or a correctional facility, could quickly identify someone with a SARS-CoV-2 infection and prevent further transmission. Modeling evidenceexternal icon shows that outbreak control depends largely on the frequency of testing and the speed of reporting and is only marginally improved by high test sensitivity. For this reason, serial antigen testing may have benefits for early identification and controlling outbreaks in some situations, such as congregate living, compared to RT-PCR tests in settings with prolonged turnaround times. See FDA\u2019s FAQ on use of antigen tests in high risk congregate settingsexternal icon.\n\nWhen used for screening testing in congregate settings, test results for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered presumptive. Confirmatory nucleic acid testing following a positive antigen test may not be necessary when the pretest probability is high, especially if the person is symptomatic or has a known exposure. When the pretest probability is low, those persons who receive a positive antigen test should isolate until they can be confirmed by RT-PCR. See CDC\u2019s Discontinuation of Isolation for Persons with COVID-19 Not in Healthcare Settings, Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions of Patients in Healthcare Settings, and Return to Work for Healthcare Personnel.\n\nConfirmatory nucleic acid testing following a negative antigen test used for screening testing may not be necessary if the pretest probability is low, the person is asymptomatic, or has no known exposures, or is part of a cohort that will receive rapid antigen tests on a recurring basis. Nucleic acid testing is also considered presumptive when screening asymptomatic persons, the potential benefits of confirmatory testing should be carefully considered in the context of person\u2019s clinical presentation.\n\nCDC will update this guidance as more data become available.\n\nReporting Rapid Antigen Test Results for SARS-CoV-2 to Health Departments and Patients\n\nA CLIA-certified laboratory or testing site must report rapid antigen diagnostic test results to the local, state, tribal, or territory health department in accordance with Public Law 116-136, \u00a7 18115(a), the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which requires \u201cevery laboratory that performs or analyzes a test that is intended to detect SARS-CoV-2 or to diagnose a possible case of COVID-19\u201d to report the results of each such test. Antigen test results that are reported to public health departments must be clearly distinguished from other COVID-19 tests, such as RT-PCR tests and antibody tests.\n\nOn June 4, 2020, the US Department of Health and Human Services published guidance on COVID-19 Pandemic Response, Laboratory Data Reporting: CARES Act Section 18115pdf iconexternal icon that specifies what additional data should be collected and electronically reported to health departments along with COVID-19 diagnostic or screening test results. Laboratory and testing professionals should collect and report complete patient demographic information and ensure that they report antigen test results using the proper LOINC code for their particular FDA-authorized assay(s). Facilities should refer to CDC\u2019s LOINC In Vitro Diagnostic (LIVD) Test Code Mapping for SARS-CoV-2 Tests.\n\nA CLIA-certified laboratory or testing site must report antigen test results to the individual or the individual\u2019s healthcare provider according to the instructions for use of the FDA-authorized SARS-CoV-2 in vitro diagnostic device that was used. Depending on the stipulations of the FDA authorization, the laboratory or testing site may be required to report negative test results to patients as \u201cpresumptive negative.\u201d\n\nLaboratories that are either CLIA-certified or non CLIA-certified may conduct surveillance testing. Results of surveillance testing that uses rapid antigen tests can be returned in aggregate to the requesting institution, such as a university or public health agency. Negative antigen surveillance test results should be reported as \u201cpresumptive negative\u201d to the requesting institution. Laboratories, regardless of their CLIA status, should not officially report the results of surveillance testing to health departments. If a local, state, tribal, or territory health department requests access to the results of surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2 that uses antigen testing, the laboratory should state in the report to the health department that the data are antigen surveillance testing results that do not represent COVID-19 diagnostic or screening test results.\n\nLaboratories that conduct surveillance testing, including surveillance testing that uses antigen tests, should not report test results to persons whose specimens have been tested, or to their health-care provider, employer, etc. Surveillance testing is performed on de-identified specimens, and thus results are not linked to an individual person. If at any time a laboratory intends to report a patient-specific test result, it must first obtain a CLIA certificate and meet all requirements to perform testing. For more information, see CMS\u2019s summary of the CLIA regulationspdf iconexternal icon. Table 1 also summarizes the reporting requirements depending on the type of testing that is performed.",

Now experts must assess whether the vaccine was responsible. Scientists on Wednesday praised the decision by AstraZeneca to suspend its late-stage coronavirus vaccine trials and begin a safety review after learning that a participant had developed a serious neurological condition. Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, testifying at a Senate hearing on Wednesday, said the step \u201cought to be reassuring.\u201d\n\nThe results of the safety review, to be conducted by an independent board of experts, will help determine if the participant\u2019s condition was a reaction to the vaccine candidate or merely coincidental, and are expected to heavily influence whether and when trials might resume.\n\nBut many details about the trial\u2019s suspension and the event that triggered it remain murky. Researchers do not yet know what caused the volunteer\u2019s symptoms, how long the evaluation process will take or what the consequences might be.\n\nPart of the review will include generating a timeline of the participant\u2019s symptoms to see if they match up roughly with when the vaccine was administered. The committee will also investigate other potential causes of the symptoms, in a process of elimination. After determining whether AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine is the probable cause, experts will advise the company on whether to resume its trials.\n\nRegulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration will also likely collect data and give additional input along the way, said Dr. Mark Goldberger, an infectious disease expert at the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership and a former F.D.A. official. No further doses of the vaccine will be administered in the interim.\n\nIn early-stage trials, AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine candidate, built from an innocuous virus, known to cause common colds in chimpanzees, that was engineered to carry coronavirus genes, yielded promising safety data in people, although several participants experienced mild or moderate side effects including fevers and aches. But the product was not necessarily responsible for the spate of symptoms experienced by the ailing late-stage trial participant, said Mark Slifka, a vaccine expert at Oregon Health and Sciences University.\n\nMore than 10,000 adult volunteers were dosed with AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine in the company\u2019s Phase 2/3 trial in the United Kingdom, where the participant fell ill. \u201cThe larger your study group, the more likely you\u2019ll find an adverse event,\u201d Dr. Slifka said. \u201cThis could occur spontaneously.\u201d A source familiar with the event, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said in an interview on Tuesday that the afflicted volunteer had experienced symptoms consistent with a condition called transverse myelitis, or inflammation of the spinal cord.\n\nIn a statement to reporters on Wednesday, an AstraZeneca spokesperson, Michele Meixell, said that the individual did not have a confirmed case of transverse myelitis. She said that the company\u2019s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, had stated in a phone call reported by STAT \u201cthat there is no final diagnosis and that there will not be one until more tests are carried out. Those tests will be delivered to an independent safety committee that will review the event and establish a final diagnosis.\u201d\n\nThe company did not respond to a request for clarification about whether transverse myelitis was suspected.\n\nTransverse myelitis is relatively rare, sparking symptoms in roughly 1,400 people each year in the United States, according to the National Institutes of Health. The condition can result in pain, muscle weakness, paralysis or bladder problems. Its root cause is often mysterious, although doctors believe the syndrome generally results when inflammatory responses in the body go awry, sometimes as a reaction to an ongoing or past infection, said Dr. Felicia Chow, a neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon that we never figure out the cause,\u201d she said.\n\nCORONAVIRUS SCHOOLS BRIEFING: It\u2019s back to school \u2014 or is it?\nSign Up\nThere has been some past speculation that vaccines might be able to trigger transverse myelitis, she added. A handful of vaccines have previously been tied to a smattering of other autoimmune disorders, including Guillain-Barre syndrome, wherein the immune system attacks the nerves. Such complications, however, are rare.\n\nBoth transverse myelitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome have been pinpointed as possible complications of Covid-19.\n\nAlthough vaccines are designed to be harmless to humans, they must still rouse the body\u2019s defenses to marshal a protective immune response. But if the wrong subsets of cells or molecules are spurred into action, or if the body cannot rein in its own responses, this could set off a cascade that starts to damage healthy tissues, said Dr. Serena Spudich, a neurologist at Yale University. The suspension appears to mark the second time that AstraZeneca has halted coronavirus vaccine trials because of severe neurological symptoms, according to information sheets uploaded to a clinical trial registry, as reported by Nature News. Another participant developed symptoms of transverse myelitis, researchers reported in July, and was later diagnosed with an \u201cunrelated neurological illness.\u201d After a safety review, trials resumed.\n\nMs. Meixell, the company spokesperson, confirmed the July pause, saying that the volunteer had \u201can undiagnosed case of multiple sclerosis, which the independent panel concluded was unrelated to the vaccine.\u201d\n\nAdverse events do occur during vaccine trials, which are explicitly designed to assess such situations to ensure that the products are both safe and effective in a wide range of people. Even if the newly reported symptoms were eventually tied to AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine, trials could still continue, especially if the case appears to be an outlier.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the vaccine is harmful,\u201d said Saad Omer, a vaccine expert at Yale University. As things stand, however, \u201cwe don\u2019t yet know the implications,\u201d he said.\n\nComplicating matters is the vaccine\u2019s dosing regimen, which involves two injections for each participant, four weeks apart. It is unclear whether the volunteer who experienced symptoms of transverse myelitis began to feel ill after receiving the first or second dose \u2014 a factor that could affect how other participants are treated, should the trial resume, Dr. Slifka said.\n\nAstraZeneca representatives did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the specifics of the pause or the measures they might take before attempting to resume trials.\n\nWhile the expert safety panel and the F.D.A. may independently weigh in as the situation develops, it is typically up to the trial\u2019s sponsor \u2014 in this case, AstraZeneca \u2014 to continue or end a trial, according to F.D.A. guidance. If the most recent adverse event is eventually confirmed as another neurological syndrome, \u201cabsolutely, they would want to go back and understand the first case better,\u201d Dr. Spudich said. Although the first participant\u2019s multiple sclerosis diagnosis was deemed unrelated to the vaccine, the data could be worth re-evaluating, she said.\n\nThere is a possibility, for instance, that a mild, undiagnosed case of multiple sclerosis may have been unmasked or exacerbated by the vaccine. However, it remains unclear whether that first volunteer received a vaccine or placebo, and how AstraZeneca would proceed with participants who have so far received the first dose but not the second.\n\nIn an online event on Thursday, Mr. Soriot, AstraZeneca\u2019s C.E.O., said that the company still expected to know by the end of the year whether its vaccine works in people, provided trials are able to resume soon. Such pauses are \u201cvery common, actually, and many experts will tell you this,\u201d Mr. Soriot added. \u201cThe difference with other vaccine trials is, the whole world is not watching them.\u201d\n\nAlthough the forecast for AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine candidate remains hazy, Dr. Goldberger emphasized that \u201cthis is a normal part of doing business in therapeutics and vaccines.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important to get safe and effective vaccines out there,\u201d he added. Should safety issues arise if a vaccine is prematurely rushed to approval, \u201cthat\u2019s going to affect general trust and willingness to be vaccinated,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got to sort through all of this to the end.\u201d",

            "HeadLine": "Considerations for Owners and Operators of Multifamily Housing Including Populations at Increased Risk for Complications from COVID-19",
            "Text": "Multifamily housing (e.g., apartments, condominiums, townhouses, duplexes, and quadruplexes) pose a challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic due to potential for increased risk of exposure for residents and staff. The following guidance is provided to help owners, administrators, and operators of multifamily housing work together with residents, staff, and public health officials to create a safe living environment and prevent the spread of COVID-19. Public health actions needed to reduce the spread of COVID-19, such as social distancing, can lead some people to feel isolated and lonely or can increase stress and anxiety. This page provides guidance in assessing and reducing exposure risks and resources for coping with stress in healthy ways.\n\nThese considerations are especially important for multifamily housing for older adults, residents living in settings that incorporate congregate or supportive services (e.g., multifamily housing that caters to older adults, low-income families, people with disabilities, etc.), and other populations who are at increased risk for acquiring COVID-19 and having complications. Other examples include individuals and families served through programs such as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Public Housing Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly, Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilitiesexternal icon, and Project-Based Rental Assistanceexternal icon, the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Multifamily Housing Rental Assistance Programexternal icon, or properties funded through the Low-Income Housing Tax Creditexternal icon program.\n\nGuiding principles\nOlder adults and groups experiencing disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19\nSevere illness means that the person with COVID-19 may require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe, or they may even die.\nOther factors may increase an individual\u2019s risk for severe illness, such as underlying medical conditions.\nAlthough older adults and people with underlying conditions face particular risks, everyone should take steps to protect themselves from exposure to the virus causing COVID-19.\nCommunal spaces, community activities, and close living quarters in multifamily housing increase the risk of getting and spreading the virus\nCOVID-19 is mostly spread person-to-person through respiratory droplets released when people cough, sneeze, or talk. Less commonly, COVID-19 may also be acquired when someone touches a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touches their nose, mouth, or eyes. COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms. Therefore, personal prevention practices such as social distancing, using masks, frequent handwashing with soap and water or hand sanitizing when handwashing with soap and water is not possible, cough etiquette, and staying home when sick, are important to reduce COVID-19. Other environmental prevention practices, such as environmental cleaning and disinfection, are also important. Administrators can take clear-cut actions to help lower the risk of COVID-19 exposure and spread in their communities and at their facilities.\n\nDevelop a plan\nDuring an infectious disease outbreak, such as the current outbreak of COVID-19, property owners, administrators, and operators should prepare to identify residents at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness, collaborate with their local health departments, and protect their employees\u2019 health and safety.\n\nSee CDC\u2019s guidance for preparing businesses and employees for the effects of COVID-19.\n\nConsider the unique needs of your residents, such as disabilities, cognitive decline, or lack of access to technology. This guidance does not address infection prevention and control in healthcare settings. If your facility offers healthcare services, consult CDC\u2019s Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Healthcare Settings.\n\nState, territorial, local, and tribal public health departments can provide specific information on COVID-19 transmission and policies in your community, which can help you decide when and if you need to scale up or relax specific prevention measures.\n\nPromote behaviors that reduce spread\nEncourage residents and staff to practice behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19. An individualized approach for COVID-19 may be needed for people with physical or intellectual disabilities or who have difficulty accessing information. Some residents require close contact with direct service providers, (e.g., home care nurses, therapists, social workers, etc.), have trouble understanding information, have difficulties with changes in routines, or have other concerns related to their disability.\n\nSelf-isolate or quarantine when appropriate\nEducate residents on when they should stay home or self-isolate in their living quarters (e.g. during mandatory shelter-in-place orders, after possible exposure to COVID-19, or if showing symptoms of COVID-19).\nActively encourage those who have symptoms of COVID-19 or who are otherwise sick to stay home or in their living quarters unless seeking medical care.\nEncourage adherence to recommendations for animals, including pets or service animals present in the household or facility.\nConsider circumstances in which social distancing and self-isolating may be difficult for many people with disabilities.\nAnyone who has had close contact with a person with COVID-19 should stay home and monitor for symptoms for 14 days.\nEncourage mask wearing\nEncourage use of CDC-recommended masks among residents, workers, and visitors in common areas and in public.\nAdvise residents to avoid others who are not wearing masks or to ask others around them to wear masks.\nSome residents may not be able to wear masks or are recommended not to wear masks:\nWearing masks may be difficult for people with sensory, cognitive, or behavioral issues.\nMasks should not be worn by children under age 2 or anyone who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, or is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.\nAdaptations and alternatives should be considered whenever possible to increase the feasibility of wearing a mask or to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading if it is not possible to wear one.\nEncourage social distancing\nIn general, interacting with more people, especially closely and for longer times, increases risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.\nAvoid gatherings of 10 or more people.\nEncourage social distancing by asking workers and residents who are not from the same household and visitors to stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) apart whenever possible.\nSocial distancing may be difficult for many people with disabilities.\n Avoid close contact with visitors. For example, don\u2019t shake hands, elbow bump or hug. Instead consider waving and verbal greetings.\nEnsure adequate supplies in common areas\nSupport healthy hygiene behaviors by providing supplies, including soap, hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, a way to dry hands, tissues, disinfectant wipes, masks (as feasible), and no-touch/foot pedal trash cans.\nDisplay relevant signs and messages\nPost signs in highly visible locations (e.g., building entrances, stairways, elevators) that promote everyday protective measures and describe how to stop the spread of germs (such as social distancing, by properly washing hands, proper cough etiquette, and properly wearing a mask).\nInclude messages (for example, videos, posters) about behaviors that prevent the spread of COVID-19 when communicating with residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors (such as on websites, in emails, in facility newsletters, and on social media accounts).\nFind free CDC print and digital resources on CDC\u2019s communications resources main page.\nIdentify and address potential language, cultural, and environmental barriers associated with communicating COVID-19 information. Consider developing communication materials in alternative formats (e.g., large print, braille, ASL) for people who have low vision or are blind or people who are deaf or hard of hearing.\nConsider developing communication materials for people with low literacy and using plain or easy to understand language or visuals.\nCommunications may need to be framed or adapted so they are culturally appropriate for your audience and easy to understand. CDC has communication resources available in many languages.\nMaintain healthy environments in common areas\nMultifamily housing complexes may consider several strategies to maintain healthy environments.\n\nEnsure adequate ventilation\nConsider conducting ventilation system upgrades or other steps to increase the delivery of clean air and dilute potential contaminants in the building. Obtain consultation from experienced Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) professionals when making changes to HVAC systems and equipment. Some of the recommendations below are based on the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Guidance for Building Operations During the COVID-19 Pandemicexternal icon. Review additional ASHRAE guidelines for multifamily buildingsexternal icon for further information on ventilation recommendations for different types of building and building readiness for occupancy. Not all steps are applicable for all scenarios.\n\nImprovement steps may include some or all of the following activities:\n\nIncrease outdoor air ventilation, using caution in highly polluted areas.\nIncrease outdoor air by opening windows and doors, when weather conditions allow. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk (e.g., risk of falling, triggering asthma symptoms) to persons using the facility.\nUse fans to increase the effectiveness of open windows. Position fans securely and carefully in or near windows to avoid potentially contaminated air flowing from one person to another. Strategic window fan placement in exhaust mode can help draw fresh air into room via other open windows and doors without generating strong room air currents.\nDecrease occupancy in common areas where outdoor ventilation cannot be increased.\nEnsure ventilation systems operate properly and provide acceptable indoor air quality for the current occupancy level for each space.\nIncrease total airflow supply to occupied spaces, when possible.\nDisable demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) controls that reduce air supply based on occupancy or temperature during occupied hours.\nFurther open minimum outdoor air dampers to reduce or eliminate HVAC air recirculation. In mild weather, this will not affect thermal comfort or humidity; however, this may be difficult to do in cold, hot, or humid weather.\nImprove central air filtration:\nIncrease air filtrationexternal icon to as high as possible without significantly diminishing design airflow.\nInspect filter housing and racks to ensure appropriate filter fit and check for ways to minimize filter bypass.\nCheck filters to ensure they are within service life and appropriately installed.\nConsider running the HVAC system at maximum outside airflow for 2 hours before and after the space is occupied.\nEnsure restroom exhaust fans are functional and operating at full capacity when the space is occupied.\nInspect and maintain local exhaust ventilation in areas such as restrooms, kitchens, cooking areas, or other areas of high occupancy.\nUse portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) fan/filtration systems to help enhance air cleaning, especially in higher risk areas such as common spaces.\nGenerate clean-to-less-clean air movement by re-evaluating the positioning of supply and exhaust air diffusers or dampers, especially in higher-risk areas such as common spaces.\nConsider using ultraviolet germicidal irradiationpdf iconexternal icon (UVGI) as a supplement to help inactivate SARS-CoV-2, especially if options for increasing room ventilation are limited.\n*Note: The ventilation intervention considerations listed above come with a range of initial costs and operating costs. There are also risk assessment parameters to consider, such as community incidence rates, face mask compliance expectations, and common room density. These factors may affect which interventions are implemented.\n\nEnsure safe water systems\nTo minimize the risk of lead or copper exposure, Legionnaires\u2019 disease, and other diseases associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (e.g., sink faucets, common area drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown.\nThese include plumbing flushing and following EPA\u2019s 3Ts, (Training, Testing, and Taking Action) for reducing lead in drinking waterexternal icon.\nIt may be necessary to conduct ongoing regular flushing after reopening. For additional resources, refer to EPA\u2019s Information on Maintaining or Restoring Water Quality in Buildings with Low or No Useexternal icon.\nDrinking fountains should be cleaned and sanitized, but encourage residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors to bring their own water to common areas to minimize use and touching of water fountains.\nPromote cleaning and disinfection\nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (e.g., door handles, handicap door access switches, sink handles, grab bars, hand railings,) within common areas of facilities at least daily or between use as much as possible.\nAdvise residents with sensory or respiratory issues to avoid these areas during and immediately after cleaning.\nLimit use of shared objects in common areas (e.g., computer equipment, remote controls, print materials) when possible, and clean and disinfect shared objects between use.\nDevelop a schedule for increased, routine cleaning and disinfection.\nProvide staff with training about the safe and correct use and storage of cleaners and disinfectants.\nUse products that meet EPA List N disinfection criteriaexternal icon. Use products according to the manufacturer\u2019s labeled directions.\nEncourage residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors to keep personal items (e.g., cell phones, other electronics), and personal work and living spaces clean.\nOffer assistance with cleaning and disinfecting for residents with disabilities who may require supervision\nEncourage residents, workers, volunteers, and visitors to use disinfectant wipes to wipe down objects and surfaces before and after use.\nEnsure safe congregate spaces\nModified layouts\n\nSocial distancing may be difficult for many people with disabilities.\nAlter schedules to reduce mixing and close contact, such as staggering activity times and forming small groups that regularly participate at the same times and do not mix with individuals in other groups.\nArrange seating of chairs and tables to be at least 6 feet apart during events.\nMinimize traffic in enclosed spaces, such as mailrooms, elevators, and stairwells.\nConsider limiting the number of individuals in an elevator at one time and designating one-directional stairwells and hallways, if possible.\nEnsure that social distancing can be maintained in communal spaces.\nPhysical barriers and guides\n\nInstall physical barriers, such as sneeze guards and partitions, particularly in areas where it is difficult for individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart (e.g., reception areas).\nProvide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls to ensure that individuals remain at least 6 feet apart. Use formats that are accessible to residents, including for those with visual impairments.\nSafe communal spaces\nSocial distancing may be difficult for many people with disabilities.\nClose indoor shared spaces such as game rooms, computer rooms, exercise rooms, and lounges if needed to ensure safety of the residents.\nOtherwise, stagger use and restrict the number of people allowed in at one time to ensure everyone can stay at least 6 feet apart, and clean and disinfect between use.\nPrioritize outdoor activities where possible.\nLimit the presence of non-essential volunteers and visitors in shared areas, when possible.\nClean and disinfect common-area bathrooms regularly (e.g., in the morning and evening, after times of heavy use) using EPA List N-registered disinfectantsexternal icon following the manufacturer\u2019s labeled directions.\nMaintain access and adequate supplies to laundry facilities. Restrict the number of people allowed in laundry rooms at one time to ensure everyone can stay at least 6 feet apart.\nConsider closing exercise rooms. Alternatively, stagger use, increase air flow by opening windows where possible, and clean and disinfect between use.\nConsider closing pools and hot tubs or limiting access to pools for essential activities only, such as water therapy. Consider additional prevention activities for public pools, hot tubs, and water playgrounds during COVID-19 for those that remain open.\nConduct maintenance and inspection visits\nTo the extent allowed by law or regulation consider:\n\nDeferring maintenance inside units for non-critical or non-life-threatening problems.\nDeferring routine in-unit inspections, especially for assisted units which may have regular mandatory inspections. Owners and operators of assisted units should be aware that authorities may have issued temporary waivers or guidance regarding inspections during the pandemic.\nMaintain healthy operations\nMultifamily housing complexes may consider several strategies to maintain healthy operations.\n\nProtections for residents and workers at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19\nOffer options for those at higher risk for severe illness (including older adults and people of all ages with certain underlying medical conditions) that limit their exposure risk (e.g., telework, modified job responsibilities, virtual participation in community events).\nConsistent with applicable law, put in place policies to protect the privacy of people at higher risk for severe illness regarding underlying medical conditions.\nRegulatory awareness\nBe aware of local or state regulatory agency policies related to multifamily housing to determine if events or activities can be held.\nIdentify strategies to maintain operations and a healthy working and living environment\nReview CDC\u2019s guidance for businesses and employers.\nIdentify an onsite coordinator who will be responsible for COVID-19 issues and their impact at the workplace.\nDevelop flexible sick leave policies for staff. Require staff to stay home when sick, even without documentation from doctors. Use flexibility, when possible, to allow staff to stay home to care for sick family or household members or to care for children in the event of school or childcare dismissals. Make sure that employees are aware of and understand these policies.\nCreate plans to protect the staff and residents from the spread of COVID-19 and help them put in place personal preventive measures.\nClean and disinfect shared areas (such as exercise room, laundry facilities, shared bathrooms, and elevators) and frequently touched surfaces using EPA List N-registered disinfectantsexternal icon more than once a day, if possible.\nIdentify services and activities (such as meal programs, in-person religious services, and exercise rooms and programs) that might need to be limited or temporarily discontinued. Consider alternative solutions (e.g., virtual services) that will help programs continue while being safe for residents.\nEstablish policies and practices for social distancing.\nIdentify a list of healthcare and mental health facilities and alternative care sites where residents with COVID-19 can receive appropriate care, if needed.\nCommunication systems\nIdentify platforms such as email, websites, hotlines, automated text messaging, newsletters, and flyers to help communicate information on:\n\nGuidance and directives from state and local officials and state and localexternal icon health departments.\nHow your facility is helping to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\nHow additional information will be shared, and where to direct questions.\nHow to stay healthy, including videos, fact sheets, and posters with information on COVID-19 symptoms and how to stop the spread of germs, how to wash your hands, and what to do if you are sick.\nHow residents can receive services such as food delivery if they are at higher risk for severe illness.\nHow staff and residents can cope and manage stress and protect others from stigma and discrimination.\nIdentify and address potential language, cultural, and disability barriers associated with communicating COVID-19 information. Communications may need to be framed or adapted so they are culturally appropriate for your audience and easy to understand. CDC has communication resources available in many languages.\nVisitors, service providers, and prospective tenants\nLoneliness and social isolation in older adults are serious health risk factors. However, because in-person social interactions are associated with increased risk of infection, owners and operators of multifamily communities are encouraged to promote safe social activities among community residents and their support networks.\n\nResidents should be encouraged to limit visitors to persons essential to maintaining their health, well-being, and safety.\nVisitors should avoid entering the building or community, including common areas and residences, unless their presence is essential to preserving the health, including mental health, well-being, and safety of residents. This can include a wide array of service providers or even community or family support networks of older adult residents.\nVisitors, service providers, and prospective tenants should follow personal protective measures and the recommendations set forth by the facility they are visiting, as well as local and state health directives.\nVisitors should also maintain social distance of at least six feet (2 meters) from residents to help reduce transmission.\nVisitors, service providers, and prospective tenants should not visit if they recently had contact with someone who had symptoms of COVID-19.\nVisitors should wear a mask while in the building and restrict their visit to the resident\u2019s room or other location designated by the facility. Everyone should be reminded to wash their hands frequently with soap and water or use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol when handwashing with soap and water is not possible.\nUnit turnover and move-ins\nFollow CDC\u2019s guidance on cleaning and disinfecting your home.\nSafely clean units and assist with unit turnovers and move-out/ins by learning how to protect yourself and others.\nNew units (especially high-touch surfaces) should be cleaned and disinfected using a disinfectant from the list of EPA List N-registered disinfectantsexternal icon. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s labeled directions.\nWait at least 24 hours since previous tenants left before cleaning and disinfecting in preparation for a new individual/family moving in. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible.\nAdditional suggestions include\nFrequent cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces, such as doorknobs, light switches, and faucets, during the moving process;\nLimiting the number of family members present during the move-in/out process;\nMaintaining social distancing between household members and movers and other residents;\nRequesting the proper use of masks;\nProviding handwashing materials \u2013 ideally soap, water and a way to dry hands if water is on in the unit, or hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol \u2013 and encouraging frequent hand hygiene;\nKeeping windows and doors open, if possible, to increase ventilation\nPrepare for when someone gets sick\nIf a resident in your multifamily housing unit has COVID-19 (suspected or confirmed)\nHave the resident contact a healthcare provider to determine whether medical evaluation is needed.\nResidents are not required to notify administrators if they think they may have or have a confirmed case of COVID-19.\nIf you do receive information that someone in your housing unit has COVID-19, work with the local health department to notify anyone in the unit who may have been exposed (had close contact with the sick person) while maintaining the confidentiality of the sick person as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and, if applicable, the Fair Housing Act, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\nProvide the sick person with information on how to care for themselves and when to seek medical attention.\nHelp address misunderstandings about why people are being asked for personal information, and why this information is important for stopping spread of COVID-19 among family, friends, and communities.\nEncourage residents with COVID-19 symptoms to self-isolate and their roommates and close contacts to quarantine. This includes limiting contact of residents with COVID-19 symptoms with any pets or service animals in the household or facility to protect them from possible infection.\nThose with COVID-19 symptoms and their close contacts should limit their use of shared spaces as much as possible.\nFollow guidance on when to stop isolation and when to end quarantine.\nMinimize the number of staff members who have face-to-face interactions with residents who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19.\nEncourage staff, other residents, caregivers such as outreach workers, and others who visit people with COVID-19 symptoms to follow recommended precautions to prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.\nStaff at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 should not have close contact with residents who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19, if possible.\nThose who have been in close contact (less than 6 feet or 2 meters) with a resident for a total of 15 minutes or more who has confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should monitor their health and call their healthcare provider if they develop symptoms suggestive of COVID-19.\nBe prepared to provide accessible transportation to people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 for testing or non-urgent medical care.\nAvoid transporting people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 using public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis unless it is the only accessible option. Follow guidelines for cleaning and disinfecting any transport vehicles.\nIf multiple cases are suspected, contact the local public health department to report the cases and to offer to an accessible community testing site, provide a platform for information-sharing, or share community insights.\nClean and disinfect\nClose off areas used by someone that has or may have COVID-19 and do not use these areas until after cleaning and disinfecting.\nWait at least 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting.\nIf 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible.\nProvide staff with training about the safe and correct use and storage of cleaning and disinfection products, including storing products securely away from children and pets.\nWatch for symptoms in residents and their family members\nPeople with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms, from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:\n\nFever or chills\nCough\nShortness of breath or difficulty breathing\nFatigue\nMuscle or body aches\nHeadache\nNew loss of taste or smell\nSore throat\nCongestion or runny nose\nNausea or vomiting\nDiarrhea\nThis list does not include all possible symptoms. CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19.\nIn some cases, older adults and people of any age with underlying health conditions may have symptoms that are not typically seen in others, or they may take longer than others to develop fever and other symptoms.",

            "Text": "As schools begin their fall semester, universities and colleges are struggling to contain coronavirus outbreaks, with cases reported at campuses in all 50 states.\n\nMore than 40,000 Covid-19 infections have been reported among students, faculty and staff at colleges and universities nationwide. The number represents cases that CNN has reported so far -- with the actual tally likely higher due to a lag from schools that update their data every few days. With social life trickling back to life on campuses, outbreaks have hit places students congregate, such as fraternities and sororities, where some have continued to gather despite remote learning.\nA cluster of Covid-19 cases was linked to a fraternity party at the University of New Hampshire. More than 100 people attended the August 29 event and few wore masks. Eleven people connected to the party have tested positive for the virus, university officials said. The University of Wisconsin-Madison is directing all undergraduate students to restrict their movements for the next two weeks in an attempt to reverse the rise in Covid-19 cases.\nIn a memo to students, faculty and staff this week, Chancellor Rebecca Blank called on students to severely limit in-person interactions and stay in their residences except for essential activities. The university directed nine campus fraternities and sororities with off-campus live-in houses to quarantine for at least 14 days.\nIllinois' Bradley University on Tuesday told all of its more than 4,500 students to quarantine in their on-campus or off-campus residences for two weeks, and to attend only online classes during that time, with allowances for meal pickups and other errands.\nThough the school had less than 50 positive cases on campus, those cases led to 500 people being put in quarantine, so the school said it decided to have everybody reset.\nAnd at Indiana University Bloomington, county health officials ordered 30 sorority and fraternity houses to quarantine last week following what campus officials have described as an \"alarming increase\" of positive Covid-19 tests within the houses.\nThe school directed Greek houses to suspend all in-person activities until at least Monday.\n\"IU's team of public health experts is extremely concerned that Greek houses are seeing uncontrolled spread of Covid-19,\" the university said. \"This poses a significant risk to the nearly 2,600 students currently living in Greek or other communal housing organizations, as well as to the other 42,000 IU Bloomington students, the campus's 12,000 faculty and staff, and the surrounding community.\"\nSome of the highest number of cases are at Miami University, University of South Carolina, Ohio State University and East Carolina University, all of which have over 1,000 confirmed cases. The University of Missouri has 862 confirmed cases while Missouri State University has 791, a CNN tally shows.\nWhile most students will likely recover, health experts have expressed concern that young people would spread the virus to the more vulnerable in their communities. Experts stress importance of flu vaccine during coronavirus pandemic\nAs cases accumulate on campuses, experts have warned that the country as a whole could see a resurgence of coronavirus cases this fall on top of flu season. A large concern is that the US could see the \"perfect storm of accelerated Covid-19 activity, as people gather more inside, in particular -- as they become continually fatigued with the mask wearing, the social distancing, and the hand hygiene, and as they are exposed to seasonal influenza,\" Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo said Thursday.\nMarrazzo, director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, made the comment during a briefing by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\n\"If there was ever a naysayer, someone who's never been vaccinated (for flu), now's the time to rise,\" Dr. Leonard Mermel, medical director for the Department of Epidemiology and Infection Control at Rhode Island Hospital, said at the same briefing. \"Get the vaccine and reduce the risk of having these two life-threatening viruses infect you at the same time, or infect one of your loved ones,\" he said.\nFor now, rates of new daily coronavirus infections reported nationwide have been dropping after a summer surge.\nThe seven-day average of new daily reported infections in the US was about 35,300 as of Wednesday, down from a peak average of 67,317 on July 22, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\nThe country's Covid-19 death rate also has dipped. The seven-day average of new daily deaths was 734 Wednesday, after it was above 1,000 from late July to August 20, JUH data show.\nCases aren't falling in every state. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said Wednesday that his state's statistics were \"getting worse by the day,\" and urged residents to do more to combat the spread.\nWest Virginia's seven-day average of new daily cases was 165 on Wednesday, up from around 100 at the end of August and around 50 at the start of July.\n\"This situation right now is really critical,\" Justice said. Giroir says he's 'never been told to slow down testing'\nThe coronavirus testing lead for the White House coronavirus task force said Thursday that he has never been told to slow testing, and the country is continuing to increase its testing capacity. \"I have never been told to slow down testing, or to reduce our efforts -- and in fact, we built on testing every single month,\" Adm. Brett Giroir, a physician and the assistant secretary for health at the US Department of Health and Human Services, told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta during a Research! America forum.\nHis comments come a day after experts said the US should be performing as many as 200 million Covid-19 tests every month to have any chance of controlling the pandemic. That report, from the Rockefeller Foundation and the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy, said fewer than 30 million tests are currently reported monthly in the country.\nGiroir said that \"this month, we should have the availability of over 100 million tests, and between 55% and 60% of those -- that's 55 to 60 million -- will be rapid point of care.\"\n\"This really puts us at an inflection point that we can really protect the elderly, we could protect the vulnerable, and we can do those kinds of screening testing for schools and work that we've been talking about for months now we have the tools to do that,\" Giroir told Gupta.\nDoctor expresses fury about 'misinformation'\nA frontline doctor is among those expressing fury over revelations that President Donald Trump downplayed the deadly threat from coronavirus early in the pandemic. In a series of interviews, Trump told investigative reporter Bob Woodward that he downplayed the danger because he didn't want people to panic.\nDr. Craig Spencer, the director of Global Health in ER Medicine at NY-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, expressed his anger at the disclosure.\n\"I'm furious because you want to talk about panic and wanting to reduce panic -- I think of the panic of every single family I called on FaceTime to let them know their family member was dying or had died,\" Spencer told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday. \"And I think about that multiplied by 190,000 times around this country.\"\nIt's \"almost impossible\" for health professionals to keep up with and correct the President's misinformatnion, he said.",

            "HeadLine": "Trump\u2019s Deliberate Coronavirus Deception",
            "Text": "Recordings, real or rumored, have been a leitmotif of the Trump era.\n\nThere was the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, in which Donald Trump confessed to his proclivity for serial sexual assault. The fabled \u201cpee tape,\u201d the existence of which would have been pornographic proof of Russiagate, haunted the first few years of the Trump presidency.\n\nJames Comey hoped there were recordings of what he described as Trump\u2019s mafia-like efforts to suborn him. (\u201cLordy, I hope there are tapes.\u201d) Michael Cohen released a tape in which the president assented to a scheme to buy the silence of a former Playboy model he allegedly slept with. Omarosa Manigault Newman had a tape in which she and two other Black Trump staffers worried about the existence of another tape, which she claimed had caught Trump using the vilest of racial slurs. The actor Tom Arnold had a whole cable series about his search, ultimately fruitless, for incriminating Trump tapes.\n\nTrump recordings loom so large because they offer the prospect of breaking through his alternative reality, of nailing down this most slippery and mendacious of presidents, of showing everyone who he really is. But even those that materialize are often quickly forgotten, as Trump\u2019s approval rating stays low but stubbornly stable and one scandal is eclipsed by another. Our politics suffers no shortage of incontrovertible proof of Trump\u2019s venality. What it lacks is accountability.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, maybe even likely, that the famed journalist Bob Woodward\u2019s utterly damning tapes of Trump discussing the coronavirus will fall into this same nothing-matters cycle. But decent people with public platforms should try to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that these tapes reveal the president lying about the pandemic that has ravaged America on his watch. What\u2019s shocking \u2014 even after more than three and a half numbing years \u2014 is the deliberate, willful nature of the lies. Unlike most Trump tapes, Woodward\u2019s actually tell us something new about the president, rather than just confirming what we think we already know.\n\nTHE ARGUMENTListen to our podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and Frank Bruni\nBecause Trump is a prodigious consumer of propaganda, as well as a creator of it, it\u2019s not always clear how aware he is of spreading disinformation. People who\u2019ve spent time with him often conclude that truth has no meaning for him. Woodward quoted Dan Coats, Trump\u2019s former director of national intelligence, saying: \u201cTo him, a lie is not a lie. It\u2019s just what he thinks. He doesn\u2019t know the difference between the truth and a lie.\u201d Trump creates for his supporters a carapace of malignant fantasy, but he often seems to live inside it with them.\n\nYet in recordings Woodward has released of Trump talking about the coronavirus \u2014 excerpts from interviews conducted for Woodward\u2019s new book, \u201cRage\u201d \u2014 the president doesn\u2019t sound ignorant or deluded. Rather, he sounds uncommonly lucid. On Feb. 7, Trump described the virus as airborne and \u201cmore deadly than even your strenuous flus,\u201d adding, \u201cthis is 5 percent versus 1 percent, or less than 1 percent.\u201d It\u2019s not clear whether Trump thought that Covid-19 had a 5 percent case fatality rate \u2014 a number that seemed plausible in February \u2014 but he clearly knew that compared with the flu, it was several times more likely to kill.\n\nAnd yet he told the country just the opposite. \u201cThe percentage for the flu is under 1 percent,\u201d Trump said on March 7. \u201cBut this could also be under 1 percent because many of the people that aren\u2019t that sick don\u2019t report.\u201d Despite knowing that the virus was airborne, he mocked mask-wearing and held several large indoor rallies. He told Woodward in March that \u201cplenty of young people\u201d were getting sick, but over the summer would insist that 99 percent of cases were \u201ctotally harmless\u201d and that children are \u201calmost immune.\u201d\n\nEditors\u2019 Picks\n\nA Man, a Pint and a Timer Become Symbols of Ireland\u2019s Pandemic Rules\n\nChess (Yes, Chess) Is Now a Streaming Obsession\n\n\u2018Dwarf Pride\u2019 Was Hard Won. Will a Growth Drug Undermine It?\nContinue reading the main story\nWe know now that this wasn\u2019t just Trump being buffoonish and engaging in magical thinking. It was conscious deception. Publicly, Trump kept insisting that the virus would disappear. Privately, he told Woodward: \u201cI wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down, because I don\u2019t want to create a panic.\u201d\n\nOf course, Trump usually loves creating panic \u2014 about immigrants, about antifa, about low-income people invading the suburbs. But there is one place he wants to maintain tranquility \u2014 in the financial markets. \u201cJust stay calm, it will go away,\u201d he said on March 10. \u201cWe want to protect our shipping industry, our cruise industry, cruise ships, we want to protect our airline industry.\u201d He added, \u201cA lot of good things are going to happen. The consumer is ready.\u201d\n\nAnd so Trump lied to the country about the calamity that would soon overtake it. His administration didn\u2019t ramp up a national testing or contact-tracing program. He and his supporters pressured states to open up prematurely. A July Pew poll found that only 46 percent of Republicans and those who lean toward the Republican Party considered the coronavirus a major threat to public health, compared with 85 percent of Democrats and Democratic leaners. Trump could have made Republicans take the virus seriously. He chose not to.\n\nNot long after attending the president\u2019s June rally in Tulsa, Okla., the former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain died of Covid-19. In August, whoever is maintaining Cain\u2019s Twitter account tweeted, \u201cIt looks like the virus is not as deadly as the mainstream media first made it out to be.\u201d It was Trump who made such a cultish commitment to denying the lethality of Covid-19 into a sign of loyalty. And all the time, he knew better.\n\nTrump supporters may not care that their president has knowingly endangered them, withholding potentially lifesaving information that he readily confided to an elite Washington journalist. But that doesn\u2019t change the importance of what Woodward has captured on tape. It\u2019s now clear that just because Trump is lying to us, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s lying to himself.\n\nTrump\u2019s lies sabotaged efforts to contain the coronavirus, almost certainly leading to many more deaths than it would have caused under a minimally competent and non-sociopathic leader. On Sept. 9, there were 1,176 coronavirus deaths in the United States. In Canada, there were two.\n\nWhen someone\u2019s actions lead to the death of another, we evaluate that person\u2019s intent and state of mind in order to assign the right measure of blame. When a president\u2019s actions lead to the deaths of thousands, we should do the same.",

            "Text": "In Michigan, Joe Biden pushed his plan to keep jobs in the United States. At the White House, President Trump laid out a list of people he\u2019d consider for the Supreme Court in a second term. President Trump acknowledged to the journalist Bob Woodward that he had knowingly played down the coronavirus earlier this year even though he was aware it was \u201cdeadly\u201d and vastly more serious than the seasonal flu.\n\n\u201cThis is deadly stuff,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Feb. 7 in one of a series of interviews Mr. Woodward conducted with the president for his upcoming book, \u201cRage.\u201d The Washington Post and CNN were given advance copies of the book and published details on Wednesday. CNN also provided audio of some of Mr. Trump\u2019s exchanges with Mr. Woodward.\n\n\u201cYou just breathe the air and that\u2019s how it\u2019s passed,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s a very tricky one. That\u2019s a very delicate one. It\u2019s also more deadly than even your strenuous flu.\u201d\n\nThat was a vastly different story than Mr. Trump was telling the public. In early March the president was suggesting on Twitter that the virus was less deadly than the flu. \u201cI wanted to always play it down,\u201d Mr. Trump told Mr. Woodward on March 19. \u201cI still like playing it down, because I don\u2019t want to create a panic.\u201d\n\nJoseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent, excoriated the president over the report. \u201cHe knew and purposely played it down,\u201d Mr. Biden said during a speech in Warren, Mich., Wednesday afternoon. \u201cWorse, he lied to the American people.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump did not deny the report in remarks at the White House later Wednesday. \u201cThe fact is I\u2019m a cheerleader for this country,\u201d he said, taking credit for imposing restrictions on travel from China. He said that he was trying to \u201cshow confidence\u201d with his public statements and rejected the suggestion that publicly minimizing the threat of the virus had cost lives.\n\nHe acknowledged speaking with Mr. Woodward, whose regular books on presidential administrations have a propensity for making news. \u201cI gave him some quotes, and frankly, we\u2019ll see how the book turned out,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d\n\nAccording to the book, the national security adviser, Robert C. O\u2019Brien, warned the president on Jan. 28 that the coronavirus represented the \u201cbiggest national security threat\u201d of his presidency, CNN reported, but Mr. Trump later said he did not remember the warning.\n\nAt the White House press briefing on Wednesday, shortly after the book\u2019s contents were made public in news reports, the press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, claimed that the president, who intentionally misled the public about the virus, had not lied. \u201cThis president does what leaders do, good leaders,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThe president has never lied to the American public on Covid.\u201d\n\nBut in public, Mr. Trump repeatedly claimed early on that the virus would disappear. On Jan. 22, asked by a CNBC reporter whether there were \u201cworries about a pandemic,\u201d the president replied: \u201cNo, not at all. We have it totally under control. It\u2019s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It\u2019s going to be just fine.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 10 he was predicting that by April, \u201cwhen it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away.\u201d And on Feb. 26, at a White House news conference, commenting on the country\u2019s first reported cases, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time. So we\u2019ve had very good luck.\u201d\n\nBut by mid-March he was claiming publicly that \u201cI felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.\u201d By then, experts said, the nation had already fallen behind on the steps it needed to take to combat the virus, from ramping up testing capability to distributing protective gear to health care workers.\n\nElsewhere in the book, according to CNN, the former defense secretary, Gen. James Mattis, is quoted calling Mr. Trump \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cunfit.\u201d He said he discussed with the former director of the office of national intelligence, Dan Coats, whether there should be \u201ccollective action\u201d to speak out publicly against Mr. Trump. And Mr. Woodward includes an anecdote about Mr. Trump being heard in a meeting saying, \u201cMy fucking generals are a bunch of pussies\u201d who care more about alliances than trade deals. WARREN, Mich. \u2014 Joseph R. Biden Jr., taking on President Trump over protecting American jobs, announced plans on Wednesday to change the tax code to discourage moving jobs overseas and to reward companies for investing in domestic production.\n\nBut before sketching out his plan, during a speech in the critical battleground state of Michigan, he took aim at Mr. Trump over new revelations from a forthcoming book by the journalist Bob Woodward that the president knowingly minimized the risks of the coronavirus to the American public.\n\n\u201cHe had the information,\u201d Mr. Biden said, accusing Mr. Trump of lying to the public. \u201cHe knew how dangerous it was. And while this deadly disease ripped through our nation, he failed to do his job on purpose. It was a life-and-death betrayal of the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s beyond despicable,\u201d Mr. Biden added, detailing the crises the nation faces as a result of the pandemic that go far beyond the staggering public health costs. \u201cIt\u2019s a dereliction of duty. It\u2019s a disgrace.\u201d\n\nDuring an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Mr. Biden used even sharper language to criticize Mr. Trump\u2019s contradictory message about the gravity of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cIt was all about making sure the stock market didn\u2019t come down, that his wealthy friends didn\u2019t lose any money,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cHe waved a white flag. He walked away. He didn\u2019t do a damn thing. Think about it. Think about what he did not do. It\u2019s almost criminal.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Mr. Biden ripped into the president\u2019s record on the economy, suggesting that Mr. Trump has not kept his promises to American workers about a range of issues, lashing his record on matters from job creation to keeping work in the United States rather than overseas.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s failed our economy and our country,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Biden also promised to take a series of executive actions to ensure the purchase of American goods in the federal procurement process.\n\nAs part of the new plans, Mr. Biden would create a tax penalty aimed at American companies that move jobs to other countries, known as offshoring. Mr. Biden has already proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent, from 21 percent. The penalty would apply to \u201cprofits of any production by a United States company overseas for sales back to the United States,\u201d bumping up the tax rate to nearly 31 percent on those profits.\n\nMr. Biden would also create a tax credit for companies that make domestic investments, such as revitalizing closed manufacturing plants, upgrading facilities or bringing back production from overseas.\n\n\u201cMake it in Michigan, make it in America, invest in our communities and the workers in places like Warren,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this is about.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden gave his speech in Warren, a city in Macomb County \u2014 a place associated with white working-class voters who traditionally voted Democratic but embraced Ronald Reagan and, later, Mr. Trump. He has intensified his efforts in recent months to unveil more populist policies aimed at boosting American workers. President Trump revealed a list of 20 people he will consider nominating to the Supreme Court if he wins a second term, reviving an election-year gimmick that he used during the 2016 campaign to win support among conservatives.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s new list includes three conservative Republican senators: Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri. (Mr. Hawley immediately took himself out of consideration, writing on Twitter that \u201cas I told the President, Missourians elected me to fight for them in the Senate, and I have no interest in the high court.\u201d) It also includes lawyers who work at the White House and the Justice Department, former solicitors general, and state and federal judges around the country.\n\n\u201cShould there be another vacancy on the Supreme Court during my presidency, my nominee will come from the names I have shared with the American public,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding that he will consider the remaining names from a similar list he released during the previous election.\n\nMr. Trump challenged Joseph R. Biden Jr. to release a similar list of names and accused him of failing to do so because of the \u201cextreme\u201d ideology that would be represented by his choices.\n\nMinutes after he was named to the list, Senator Cotton wrote on Twitter that \u201cIt\u2019s time for Roe v. Wade to go,\u201d weighing in directly on abortion rights, an issue that past nominees to the court have often tried to finesse. Speaking to reporters from the Diplomatic Reception Room in the White House, Mr. Trump predicted that the next president might have the opportunity to nominate \u201cone, two, three and even four\u201d justices.\n\nHe said that a Democratic president would stack the court with a \u201cradical left movement\u201d that would be bad for the country.\n\nDuring his four years in office, Mr. Trump has successfully secured the confirmation of two Supreme Court justices \u2014 Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 and more than 200 other federal judges, significantly shifting the judiciary to the right.\n\nIn addition to the senators, Mr. Trump\u2019s new list includes: Daniel Cameron, the attorney general of Kentucky; Paul Clement and Noel Francisco, who both served as United States solicitor general; Kate Comerford Todd, a deputy counsel in the White House; Christopher Landau, the ambassador to Mexico; and several federal and state judges. Democratic congressional leaders sent a letter to colleagues on Wednesday pleading with them to urge their constituents to vote as early as possible, citing their concerns that President Trump, with the help of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, is working to kneecap the Postal Service to ensure his own re-election.\n\n\u201cDemocrats need to convey a loud, clear message to voters about how to overcome these concerns: To prevent Donald Trump from stealing this election, VOTE,\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, wrote in an unusual letter sent from a campaign account rather than an official one. \u201cAmericans must vote as early as they can \u2014 especially if you plan to vote by mail.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has railed against mail-in voting, claiming that it will rig the election against him and asserting with no evidence that it is fraudulent. At the same time, Mr. DeJoy, installed in June by a board packed with Republican loyalists, has made operational changes at the Postal Service that have coincided with a mail-delivery slowdown.\n\nThe agency recently warned states that it might not have the ability to process all last-minute ballots, opening the possibility that hundreds of thousands mailed in the days leading up to the election could arrive too late to be counted. It has started a public education campaign to reassure Americans that the Postal Service can handle voting by mail and to urge those who plan to do so to send their ballots early. But its ads stop short of encouraging mail-in voting.\n\nIn their letter, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer encouraged Democratic lawmakers to direct their constituents to iwillvote.com, a website funded by the Democratic National Committee where people can register to vote and find out how to do so in person or by mail.\n\n\u201cThe best way to avoid lines, obstacles and delays is by not waiting until Election Day to vote,\u201d they wrote. \u201cStay vigilant: With President Trump actively working to undermine the legitimacy of voting by mail, we must remain vigilant against efforts to discourage or deceive voters.\u201d Should Bob Woodward have withheld a February quote from President Trump, who privately told him the coronavirus was \u201cdeadly stuff\u201d even as he publicly minimized its severity? Could Mr. Woodward have helped save lives by releasing the information sooner?\n\nThe revelation of Mr. Trump\u2019s characterization of the virus came Wednesday with the first reports about Mr. Woodward\u2019s new book, \u201cRage,\u201d which is due out next week. Mr. Trump shared the information in an interview with Mr. Woodward for the book about his presidency. It prompted a larger debate around journalistic ethics, with some arguing that Mr. Woodward, a lion of American journalism, had an obligation to report or share Mr. Trump\u2019s assessment sooner.\n\nIn the hours after CNN and The Washington Post, which were given advance access to the book, reported the quotations, many observers argued that the public had a right not only to the information about the deadly potential of the virus early on but also to the fact that Mr. Trump had been told the truth by experts and yet continued to mislead Americans. An often cited example is his comments in March comparing the coronavirus favorably to the seasonal flu.\n\nIt is estimated that the toll of Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, will soon reach 200,000 lives in the United States.\n\n\u201cTrump was the key vector of harmful misinformation,\u201d said Marc Ambinder, a former White House correspondent for National Journal, on Twitter. \u201cWe KNOW that his supporters BELIEVE HIM and altered their behavior because they thought COVID would be less harmful then the flu \u2026 cause that\u2019s what Trump said.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI\u2019m inclined to say that holding onto this is and was flat out wrong.\u201d Others defended Mr. Woodward. \u201cIf you believe that Woodward publishing Trump\u2019s quote in March would\u2019ve changed anything on Coronavirus the last four years have taught you absolutely nothing,\u201d said James Ball, the global editor of The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, on Twitter. Mr. Woodward did not reply to requests for comment Wednesday evening.\n\nWhile it is common for journalists and book authors to agree to hold back information or comments from sources until an agreed-upon date, Mr. Woodward told Margaret Sullivan, The Post\u2019s media columnist, on Wednesday that there was no such deal in place.\n\nRather, Mr. Woodward said, he declined to share the comment in February or March because he did not learn until May that it had come from an intelligence briefing. By then, he told The Associated Press on Wednesday, the quote\u2019s significance pertained to politics rather than public health, and the relevant deadline was the November election.\n\nHis ultimate goal, he told Ms. Sullivan, was to produce \u201cthe best obtainable version of the truth.\u201d\n\nMr. Woodward has chronicled several presidents since the 1970s, when, with his Post colleague Carl Bernstein, he helped expose the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s resignation. Though he has the title of associate editor at The Post, he is no longer a Post employee, a spokeswoman confirmed. A new poll shows most voters think Trump did a bad job on the virus and doubt he can help the country recover. With just eight weeks to go until Election Day, and early voting starting well before then, voters continue to disapprove of President Trump\u2019s coronavirus response and believe that Joseph R. Biden Jr. would do a better job handling the pandemic, according to a new poll from Monmouth University.\n\nOnly 37 percent of registered voters say Mr. Trump has done a good job handling the virus, and 56 percent say he has done a bad job. More broadly, only 27 percent say the country is heading in the right direction.\n\nForty-four percent say they are confident or somewhat confident that Mr. Trump can put the country \u201con the road to recovery\u201d from the pandemic, and 56 percent say they are not confident. The numbers are reversed for Mr. Biden, the Democratic nominee: 53 percent of voters say they are confident in his ability to put the country on the road to recovery, and 45 percent say they are not confident.\n\nA wide partisan gap persists on the question of whether officials are lifting restrictions too quickly or not quickly enough, but over all, 58 percent of registered voters said states were moving too fast.\n\n\u201cLabor Day generally serves as a marker for returning to a more normal flow of life,\u201d Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a news release. \u201cThat\u2019s not happening this year and could be leading to an increase in anxiety levels.\u201d\n\nThe poll, conducted from Sept. 3 to Sept. 8, surveyed 867 voters and has a margin of error of roughly plus or minus 3 percentage points. Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, took issue on Wednesday with President Trump\u2019s suggestion that a coronavirus vaccine would be available by Election Day, as he repeatedly sought to reassure senators and the public that a vaccine would not be made available to the public unless it was safe and effective.\n\n\u201cCertainly to try to predict whether it happens on a particular week before or after a particular date in early November is well beyond anything that any scientist right now could tell you and be confident they know what they are saying,\u201d Dr. Collins told the Senate Committee on Health, Education Labor and Pensions at a hearing on the effort to find a vaccine.\n\nDr. Collins is the latest leading medical expert to throw cold water on Mr. Trump\u2019s prediction. Last Thursday, the chief adviser for the White House vaccine program, Moncef Slaoui, said it was \u201cextremely unlikely but not impossible\u201d that a vaccine could be available by the end of October. And on Tuesday, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci said the same thing, saying that it was more likely that a vaccine could be ready by the end of the year.\n\nWednesday\u2019s hearing came amid growing concern over whether Americans would be reluctant to take a coronavirus vaccine, and whether the president would apply political pressure on his administration to quickly approve one to give him a boost in his re-election bid against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nOn Tuesday, a group of drug companies competing with one another to develop vaccines pledged that they would not release any vaccines that did not follow rigorous efficacy and safety standards, and a leading vaccine developer, AstraZeneca, suspended its large-scale clinical trial of a vaccine candidate after a patient experienced a severe adverse reaction.\n\nDemocrats on the panel grilled both Dr. Collins and Jerome Adams, the surgeon general, on the effect of Mr. Trump\u2019s overly rosy statements about the prospect of the vaccine, and whether they would erode trust in the development process. Dr. Collins demurred, however, as Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachussetts, asked him point blank whether Mr. Trump\u2019s misinformation would discourage people from taking the vaccine and hurt the effort to distribute it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I know the answer to that question,\u201d Dr. Collins said, adding, \u201cI just hope Americans will choose to take the information they need from scientists and not from politicians.\u201d An aviation company in Nevada on Wednesday withdrew its invitation to President Trump to hold a 5,000-person rally at its airport hangar, the first of two campaign events planned for this weekend that officials said would have violated Nevada\u2019s coronavirus restrictions.\n\nThe company, Hangar 9 L.L.C., had planned to host Mr. Trump on Saturday at its hangar at the Reno-Tahoe International Airport, but was told on Tuesday by airport officials that the event would have violated the terms of its lease, according to a letter sent by the airport authority.\n\nThe lease stipulates that the company must comply with all applicable state laws and directives, which means it has to follow a statewide order signed in May by Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, limiting gatherings to no more than 50 people, airport officials said.\n\n\u201cGiven the above, you are hereby advised that you may not proceed with the proposed gathering,\u201d Tina Iftiger, a senior vice president and chief commercial officer of the airport, wrote.\n\nClaude R. Cognian, a representative of Hangar 9, told airport officials on Wednesday that the company could not risk losing the lease for its hangar and would stand down, according to correspondence obtained by The New York Times.\n\n\u201cThen this leaves us with no other option than to communicate to President Trump and his campaign that we cannot help him/them and we are withdrawing the offer to use the hangar,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe Trump campaign had been scheduled to hold a similar rally on Sunday at a private jet charter company based at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, but an airport spokesman said that the authorities must approve any events on the property and that they had never received a request from the organizers.\n\nThe charter company that had been listed as the host of the event, Cirrus Aviation, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr. Trump, who lost Nevada by less than three percentage points in 2016, still plans to travel to the state this weekend, according to representatives of his campaign. They accused Democrats of short-circuiting the rallies.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are trying to keep President Trump from speaking to voters because they know the enthusiasm behind his re-election campaign cannot be matched by Joe Biden,\u201d Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, said.\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Sisolak said that the governor\u2019s office had no involvement or communication with the event organizers or potential hosts of the two events, which the Trump campaign had been promoting. She noted that the White House\u2019s coronavirus task force had recommended limits on gatherings in Nevada.\n\nMr. Trump has been broadly criticized by public health authorities for defying guidelines meant to stop the transmission of the virus. He held a large indoor rally in June in Tulsa, Okla., and has recently been holding outdoor rallies at airport hangars: At one in North Carolina this week, he spoke before a large crowd and did not wear a mask, despite pleas from some local Republican officials that he follow the state\u2019s guidelines. Two national political conventions and days of protests and unrest following a police shooting in Kenosha, Wis., have done little to change the contours of the presidential campaign in that state, according to a Marquette Law School poll released Wednesday.\n\nThe new poll, of 688 likely Wisconsin voters, found that 47 percent planned to vote for Joseph R. Biden Jr. and 43 percent for President Trump, which is within the poll\u2019s margin of error. That represented a slight tightening from earlier Marquette polls: One in early August showed Mr. Biden leading Mr. Trump, 49 percent to 44 percent. The new survey had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.\n\n\u201cDespite all those real-world events, there is very little change in this poll,\u201d Charles Franklin, Marquette\u2019s poll director, said in a video accompanying the release.\n\nThe poll was made public as Wisconsin, a swing state that helped elect Mr. Trump in 2016, became the center of the campaign in recent days. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden traveled to Kenosha after the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, led to days of protests, and a 17-year-old white man was arrested on charges of killing two protesters. The new poll was conducted from Aug. 30 to Sept. 3, so it did not fully reflect the impact of their visits.\n\nA majority \u2014 54 percent \u2014 of respondents said that they disapproved of Mr. Trump\u2019s handling of protests, while only 36 percent said they approved, the poll found. And 56 percent said that they disapproved of Mr. Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus. But Mr. Trump is still viewed favorably on the economy: Fifty-two percent said that they approved of his handling of it.\n\nA new poll of another key battleground state, Pennsylvania, showed Mr. Biden in the lead there. The NBC News/Marist poll found Mr. Biden leading Mr. Trump among likely voters by 53 percent to 44 percent.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s lead there was due in part to strong support from suburban voters \u2014 which were key to Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in 2016 \u2014 and voters with college degrees, according to the poll of 771 likely Pennsylvania voters, which was conducted from Aug. 31 to Sept. 7. Mr. Biden leads Mr. Trump among suburban voters by nearly 20 percentage points.\n\nAmong independents, Mr. Biden leads Mr. Trump 57 percent to 35 percent. The two are tied with white voters, but Mr. Biden has a commanding lead among nonwhite voters, 75 percent to 19 percent. Mr. Biden also leads among women, 59 percent to 38 percent.\n\nThe poll has a margin of error of about four percentage points.\n\n\u2014 Michael Cooper and Sydney Ember\nTrump\u2019s campaign was badly outraised by Biden and the Democrats last month. President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee and their shared committees reported raising over $210 million in the month of August, a large amount that was nonetheless dwarfed by what Joseph R. Biden Jr. raised in the same time frame.\n\nAnd officials declined to say how much cash they have in the bank, which is a key marker of what they can spend on going forward.\n\nMr. Biden and affiliated Democratic committees reported raising $364.5 million in August. They also have not yet said how much they have in cash on hand.\n\nThe momentum for Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign in fund-raising and the polls came as a once-seemingly insurmountable cash advantage for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign has evaporated. Biden ad looks to keep focus on Trump\u2019s reported remarks disparaging American soldiers.\nUsually, presidential campaign TV advertising aims to influence voters in battleground states. But in the Trump era, more ads are targeting a far narrower audience: Washington\u2019s chattering class and President Trump, America\u2019s cable news watcher-in-chief.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the Democratic National Committee and the presidential campaign of Joseph R. Biden Jr. bought TV airtime in Washington to debut an ad touting report last week in The Atlantic that Mr. Trump privately referred to American soldiers killed in combat as \u201closers\u201d and \u201csuckers.\u201d The Message\nSince The Atlantic\u2019s story broke last Thursday, the Biden campaign has done whatever it can to give it oxygen. Mr. Biden addressed it in a speech on Friday and brought it up again during a Labor Day event. His campaign has sent fund-raising emails soliciting donations off the president\u2019s comments and circulated other news outlets\u2019 reporting confirming the gist of the original report.\n\nNow, six days after it first popped, the Biden campaign is trying to keep the story in Washington\u2019s bloodstream.\n\nThe 60-second ad opens with black-and-white footage of soldiers and a reminder that 1,800 Marines died at the battle of Belleau Wood in World War I.\n\n\u201cBut when Donald Trump was asked to pay his respects, he said, \u2018Why should I go to that cemetery? It\u2019s filled with losers,\u2019\u201d the ad intones, with an on-screen graphic citing The Atlantic\u2019s reporting.\n\nThe ad goes on to cite Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks calling Senator John McCain \u201ca loser\u201d and his wondering aloud \u201cwhat was in it for\u201d those buried at Arlington National Cemetery, before stating, \u201cDonald Trump inherited everything, sacrificed nothing, scoffs at the valor of those who gave it all for America.\u201d\n\nFact Check\nMr. Trump did in fact call Mr. McCain a \u201closer\u201d and said of Mr. McCain during a July 2015 campaign stop in Iowa: \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero. He\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump and his top White House aides have denied The Atlantic report, but the thrust of it has been confirmed by several competing news organizations, including Fox News, and no current senior military officer has refuted it.\n\nWhere It\u2019s Running\nSo far, just once: in Washington during the 6 a.m. hour of \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on MSNBC, an hour at which Mr. Trump is known to be channel surfing. A Democratic National Committee official said the ad would also air in Arizona, Florida, Maine, North Carolina and Virginia.\n\nThe Takeaway\nEvery day that the presidential campaign is about Mr. Trump and not Mr. Biden is a good one for the Biden campaign. Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks about America\u2019s veterans have been Topic A in Washington for nearly a week now, and the Biden campaign is happy to keep the conversation going.\n\n\u2014 Reid J. Epstein\nThe go-to Republican election lawyer called Trump\u2019s claims of voting fraud \u2018unsustainable.\u2019\nBenjamin L. Ginsberg is one of the top election lawyers in the nation, the go-to attorney for Republicans in nearly every major election law battle over the past 38 years \u2014 most famously, the Florida recount in 2000 in the disputed presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Mr. Ginsberg won that one. His reputation as an expert in this (often deliberately) complicated field of law crosses party lines.\n\nWhich makes an op-ed that Mr. Ginsberg wrote in The Washington Post striking. Mr. Ginsberg \u2014 who perhaps not coincidentally has the freedom that comes from having just retired from his law firm \u2014 flatly disputed President Trump\u2019s assertions that mail-in voting is \u201cvery dangerous\u201d and that \u201cthere is tremendous fraud involved and tremendous illegality.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lack of evidence renders these claims unsustainable,\u201d Mr. Ginsberg wrote. \u201cThe truth is that after decades of looking for illegal voting, there\u2019s no proof of widespread fraud. At most, there are isolated incidents \u2014 by both Democrats and Republicans. Elections are not rigged.\u201d\n\nThese are \u201cpainful conclusions for me to reach,\u201d Mr. Ginsberg said, noting his own work in a catalog of redistricting and voter recount cases on behalf of his party, and that he served as the counsel to the Republican National Committee and to four of the past six Republican presidential nominees.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s rhetoric has put my party in the position of a firefighter who deliberately sets fires to look like a hero putting them out,\u201d he wrote. \u201cRepublicans need to take a hard look before advocating laws that actually do limit the franchise of otherwise qualified voters. Calling elections \u2018fraudulent\u2019 and results \u2018rigged\u2019 with almost nonexistent evidence is antithetical to being the \u2018rule of law\u2019 party.\u201d\n\nHow significant is this? Well, imagine if Jerry Brown, the former Democratic governor of California and longtime environmental warrior, wrote an op-ed for The Sacramento Bee arguing that global warming doesn\u2019t exist.",

            "HeadLine": "How the Coronavirus Attacks the Brain",
            "Text": "It\u2019s not just the lungs \u2014 the pathogen may enter brain cells, causing symptoms like delirium and confusion, scientists reported. The coronavirus targets the lungs foremost, but also the kidneys, liver and blood vessels. Still, about half of patients report neurological symptoms, including headaches, confusion and delirium, suggesting the virus may also attack the brain.\n\nA new study offers the first clear evidence that, in some people, the coronavirus invades brain cells, hijacking them to make copies of itself. The virus also seems to suck up all of the oxygen nearby, starving neighboring cells to death.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the virus gets to the brain or how often it sets off this trail of destruction. Infection of the brain is likely to be rare, but some people may be susceptible because of their genetic backgrounds, a high viral load or other reasons.\n\n\u201cIf the brain does become infected, it could have a lethal consequence,\u201d said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University who led the work.\n\nThe study was posted online on Wednesday and has not yet been vetted by experts for publication. But several researchers said it was careful and elegant, showing in multiple ways that the virus can infect brain cells.\n\nScientists have had to rely on brain imaging and patient symptoms to infer effects on the brain, but \u201cwe hadn\u2019t really seen much evidence that the virus can infect the brain, even though we knew it was a potential possibility,\u201d said Dr. Michael Zandi, consultant neurologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Britain. \u201cThis data just provides a little bit more evidence that it certainly can.\u201d Dr. Zandi and his colleagues published research in July showing that some patients with Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, develop serious neurological complications, including nerve damage. In the new study, Dr. Iwasaki and her colleagues documented brain infection in three ways: in brain tissue from a person who died of Covid-19, in a mouse model and in organoids \u2014 clusters of brain cells in a lab dish meant to mimic the brain\u2019s three-dimensional structure.\n\nOther pathogens \u2014 including the Zika virus \u2014 are known to infect brain cells. Immune cells then flood the damaged sites, trying to cleanse the brain by destroying infected cells.\n\nThe coronavirus is much stealthier: It exploits the brain cells\u2019 machinery to multiply, but doesn\u2019t destroy them. Instead, it chokes off oxygen to adjacent cells, causing them to wither and die.\n\nThe researchers didn\u2019t find any evidence of an immune response to remedy this problem. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a silent infection,\u201d Dr. Iwasaki said. \u201cThis virus has a lot of evasion mechanisms.\u201d These findings are consistent with other observations in organoids infected with the coronavirus, said Alysson Muotri, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, who has also studied the Zika virus.\n\nThe coronavirus seems to rapidly decrease the number of synapses, the connections between neurons. \u201cDays after infection, and we already see a dramatic reduction in the amount of synapses,\u201d Dr. Muotri said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet if that is reversible or not.\u201d\n\nThe virus infects a cell via a protein on its surface called ACE2. That protein appears throughout the body and especially in the lungs, explaining why they are favored targets of the virus.\n\nPrevious studies have suggested, based on a proxy for protein levels, that the brain has very little ACE2 and is likely to be spared. But Dr. Iwasaki and her colleagues looked more closely and found that the virus could indeed enter brain cells using this doorway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that it is expressed in the neurons and it\u2019s required for entry,\u201d Dr. Iwasaki said.\n\nHer team then looked at two sets of mice \u2014 one with the ACE2 receptor expressed only in the brain, and the other with the receptor only in the lungs. When researchers introduced the virus into these mice, the brain-infected mice rapidly lost weight and died within six days. The lung-infected mice did neither.\n\nDespite the caveats attached to mouse studies, the results still suggest that virus infection in the brain may be more lethal than respiratory infection, Dr. Iwasaki said.\n\nThe virus may get to the brain through the olfactory bulb \u2014 which regulates smell \u2014 through the eyes or even from the bloodstream. It\u2019s unclear which route the pathogen is taking, and whether it does so often enough to explain the symptoms seen in people.\n\n\u201cI think this is a case where the scientific data is ahead of the clinical evidence,\u201d Dr. Muotri said.\n\nResearchers will need to analyze many autopsy samples to estimate how common brain infection is and whether it is present in people with milder disease or in so-called long-haulers, many of whom have a host of neurological symptoms.\n\nForty percent to 60 percent of hospitalized Covid-19 patients experience neurological and psychiatric symptoms, said Dr. Robert Stevens, a neurologist at Johns Hopkins University. But the symptoms may not all stem from the virus\u2019s invasion of brain cells. They may be the result of pervasive inflammation throughout the body.\n\nFor example, inflammation in the lungs can release molecules that make the blood sticky and clog up blood vessels, leading to strokes. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for the brain cells themselves to be infected for that to occur,\u201d Dr. Zandi said.\n\nBut in some people, he added, it may be low blood oxygen from infected brain cells that leads to strokes: \u201cDifferent groups of patients may be affected in different ways,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite possible that you\u2019ll see a combination of both.\u201d\n\nSome cognitive symptoms, like brain fog and delirium, might be harder to pick up in patients who are sedated and on ventilators. Doctors should plan to dial down sedatives once a day, if possible, in order to assess Covid-19 patients, Dr. Stevens said.",

            "Text": "On Feb. 7, during a taped interview with Bob Woodward, President Trump acknowledged that the coronavirus could be transmitted through the air, that it was very dangerous and that it would be difficult to contain. \u201cThis is deadly stuff,\u201d he told the investigative journalist.\n\n\u201cYou just breathe the air, and that\u2019s how it\u2019s passed,\u201d the president warned.\n\nDespite his apparent understanding of the severity of the disease and its method of transmission, over the next month, in five cities around the country, Mr. Trump held large indoor rallies, which were attended by thousands of his supporters.\n\nMr. Trump spent weeks insisting in public that the coronavirus was no worse than a seasonal flu. It would \u201cdisappear\u201d when the seasons changed, he promised in late February. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a great job,\u201d he said in early March.\n\nWhy lie to the American people? Why \u2014 as the administration accuses the Chinese government of doing \u2014 lie to the world about the severity of what was declared a pandemic only days later?\n\n\u201cI wanted to always play it down,\u201d Mr. Trump told Mr. Woodward on March 19. \u201cI still like playing it down, because I don\u2019t want to create a panic.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump and a great many of his supporters and political allies did play down the severity of the coronavirus and did criticize the public health measures deployed to prevent its spread. As a result, the coronavirus spread faster and sickened or killed more people in the United States than in any of its peer nations. If the United States had the same coronavirus fatality rate as Canada, more than 100,000 Americans could still be alive today.\n\nMake sense of the moment.\nOne day only: Subscribe for $1 a week.\nMuch of the responsibility for the fatal mishandling of the pandemic lies with the president. But with every public lie out of Mr. Trump\u2019s mouth, or on his Twitter feed, how many members of his administration who knew better stayed silent?\n\nThe president has repeatedly tried to muzzle and sideline scientists and health officials who disagree with his sunny assessments, often replacing them with less qualified people willing to sing his praises.\n\nSo it was that the president\u2019s coronavirus task force revised guidelines on testing for asymptomatic people, while the task force\u2019s leading infectious disease doctor, Anthony Fauci, was having surgery. So it is that, in the pandemic\u2019s seventh month, Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist with no background in infectious disease outbreaks, is arguing that it\u2019s not the government\u2019s job to stamp out the coronavirus, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention remain silent.\n\nEditors\u2019 Picks\n\nA Man, a Pint and a Timer Become Symbols of Ireland\u2019s Pandemic Rules\n\nThe Photographer Capturing Unvarnished Truths\n\nJane Fonda, Intergalactic Eco-Warrior in a Red Coat\nContinue reading the main story\nMr. Trump\u2019s lack of leadership almost certainly made the nation\u2019s suffering greater, its death toll higher and its economic costs more severe in the long term. When the president dithered on testing and contact tracing, when he failed to make or execute a clear and effective plan for securing personal protective equipment, when he repeatedly belittled and dismissed mask mandates and other social distancing edicts, Mr. Trump knew the virus was deadly and airborne. He knew that millions of people could get sick, and many would die.\n\nFurthermore, Mr. Woodward\u2019s tapes make clear that members of the Trump administration failed to act \u2014 even behind the scenes \u2014 based on what they knew at the time.\n\nNearly 200,000 people in the United States have already died, and hundreds of thousands more have suffered grave illness \u2014 often followed by a slow, hard recovery and, in some cases, permanent disability. Tens of millions of people have lost their jobs, and millions are on the cusp of losing their homes. School systems and elder care networks are struggling to function. The economy is in tatters.\n\nImagine what this picture could look like today had the president been honest with the American public on Feb. 7, calmly taken charge of the nation\u2019s response to the pandemic and done his best to protect them.",

            "HeadLine": "Summer Jet-Setters Turned Sardinia Into a Virus Hot Spot",
            "Text": "ROME \u2014 The allure of the turquoise waters, extravagant villas and exclusive dance clubs of the Emerald Coast of Sardinia proved stronger than ever in August, as Italian tourists hungry for virus-free air mingled with regulars of the international party circuit hopping across from places like the Spanish island of Ibiza and Mykonos in the Aegean Sea.\n\nThey joined Silvio Berlusconi, the mogul who dominated Italian politics for a quarter-century and whose Sardinian refuge is worthy of a Roman emperor; and his businessman friend Flavio Briatore, an acquaintance of President Trump, biological father of Heidi Klum\u2019s first child and owner of the island\u2019s unapologetically hedonistic club Billionaire.\n\nNow Mr. Berlusconi, 83, lies in a Milan hospital with pneumonia after contracting the coronavirus. Mr. Briatore, who dropped in to pay him a visit at his Sardinian estate and who had publicly complained about what he said was an overreaction by the government to the pandemic, is quarantined in Milan with Covid-19, too.\n\nIt is not clear when or how Mr. Berlusconi or Mr. Briatore were infected. But local officials say that Billionaire and a few other clubs ignored health regulations and became the petri dish of an island epidemic that infected soccer coaches, socialites and showgirls as it spread to the mainland.\n\nMr. Briatore\u2019s club says that it did more than was asked of it and blamed a sensationalist news media for jumping to conclusions.\n\nWhat is for sure is that the number of daily cases in Sardinia shot up from a few new infections a day before August to about 100 a day. The health authorities in Lazio, the region that includes Rome, said on Wednesday that people returning from Sardinia this summer constituted about half \u2014 some 1,250 people \u2014 of the total number of cases that had originated outside the region since the beginning of the outbreak. Since March, there have been more than 12,500 cases in Lazio and more than 2,600 in Sardinia, according to official figures. Roberto Ragnedda, the mayor of the Sardinian town of Arzachena, where many of the clubs are, said \u201c10 days of madness\u201d in August had caused \u201cenormous damage to our image and to economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the owners of the clubs were more careful these outbreaks could have been avoided,\u201d he said, adding that, despite having gotten the outbreak under control, \u201cwe are seen as the source of everything wrong.\u201d For the authorities in Sardinia, the summer realized their worst nightmare.\n\nIn March, as infections and deaths exploded in the country\u2019s north, the southern island\u2019s governor, Christian Solinas, pleaded with the authorities in Rome to ban travel to Sardinia because Italians, especially those with a second home there, kept arriving. The government obliged.\n\nAs a result, Sardinia essentially dodged the Covid-19 disaster. In mid-April, when Italy reached more than 170,000 total cases for the virus, Sardinia had about 1,000.\n\nOver the ensuing months, the virus all but vanished from the island, with zero new infections on May 14. Mr. Solinas vowed to keep it that way and at the time proposed requiring a \u201csanitary passport,\u201d essentially a sticker certifying a negative coronavirus test result attached to a boat or plane ticket. The government called it unconstitutional, and ultimately, tourists only had to register via an online form on the region\u2019s website.\n\nStill, it seemed sufficient. Mr. Solinas, using powers given by the national government, decided to reopen outdoor nightclubs, as long as people danced at a distance.\n\nBut August has been Sardinia\u2019s hot season since the 1960s, when the Aga Khan, the spiritual leader of some 20 million Ismaili Muslims worldwide and an enthusiastic jet-setter, banded together with friends to buy miles of northeastern coastal land from herders and developed luxurious hotels, yacht and golf clubs and a village in medieval Moorish style along what became known as the Emerald Coast. This year, it became Italy\u2019s viral hot spot; \u201cthe Emerald Covid,\u201d according to one headline in the newspaper Corriere della Sera.\n\nThe authorities are investigating partygoers for leaving false names and numbers at clubs to avoid contact tracing. The Italian civil protection agency complained about a 5 a.m. incident at the Just Cavalli nightclub of the zebra-print fashion house Roberto Cavalli, in which a man broke the nose of a volunteer for blocking his yellow Mercedes and \u201cruining his holiday.\u201d Johnny Micalusi, a Rome-based celebrity chef known as the King of Fish and for schmoozing with his famous guests at their tables, was hospitalized with Covid-19 after working out of a Sardinian club.\n\nCORONAVIRUS SCHOOLS BRIEFING: It\u2019s back to school \u2014 or is it?\nSign Up\nBut according to Mr. Ragnedda, the \u201cmost egregious\u201d offender was Mr. Briatore, at whose club he once delivered drinks while working his way through law school.\n\nMr. Briatore declined a request for an interview through Patrizia Spinelli, a spokeswoman for his Billionaire Life brand. (\u201cWe didn\u2019t just create a company, we built a lifestyle\u201d is its motto.) She said the club was not responsible: \u201cWe are victims of the situation, too, and took all the precautions.\u201d\n\nShe noted that the club had gone above and beyond health regulations, limiting its season to a single month, specially training its staff and halving the number of tables for the dinner show it developed to replace the usual disco.\n\nShe said Mr. Ragnedda forced the club to close early by banning the loud music necessary in a song and dance performance that people expected with their dinner.\n\n\u201cWe are all about music and energy,\u201d she said. But according to Mr. Ragnedda, the \u201cmost egregious\u201d offender was Mr. Briatore, at whose club he once delivered drinks while working his way through law school.\n\nMr. Briatore declined a request for an interview through Patrizia Spinelli, a spokeswoman for his Billionaire Life brand.

She said that 27 infected members of the club\u2019s staff were isolated in single rooms at the company\u2019s expense in the Billionaire residences, and confirmed that about 30 contractors had also been infected.\n\nMr. Briatore is in quarantine after discovering his infection during an Aug. 22 checkup for an unrelated ailment. This week, he assured his Instagram followers, \u201cI have not disappeared,\u201d and said that he was in \u201csuper form.\u201d\n\nMr. Briatore, a convicted card cheat and fixer of Formula 1 motor races, is also the star of the Italian version of \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was only one person that I wanted. And that was Flavio,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a promo for the Italian show. In another spot, the two men appear together at Trump Tower, firing each other. Mr. Briatore once claimed of Mr. Trump that he had been \u201cthe first to bring him to Europe\u201d but has since downgraded their relationship status to a publicity stunt.\n\nMr. Briatore, who usually wears a white beard and black T-shirts, has bristled at the attacks on Billionaire, telling Italian reporters that his club \u201calways respected the rules.\u201d\n\nBut videos on social media depicting less-than-quiet sit-down dinners have caused an uproar.\n\nIn one, a train of women transport champagne bottles loaded with sparklers through thumping music and a sweaty crowd. Almost nobody is wearing a mask.\n\nIn a social media post a few days before his coronavirus diagnosis, Mr. Briatore, 70, attacked a virologist for speaking badly about his club, saying that such scientists had \u201cterrorized Italy.\u201d \u201cLet us work,\u201d Briatore said in another post on May 31. \u201cThe coronavirus provides insurance for this government, they are scaring everyone, and since everything has been going down since June, they start scaring people for September,\u201d he added. He also cited a comment made by his doctor, Alberto Zangrillo, who has said, \u201cCovid clinically no longer exists; someone is terrorizing the country.\u201d (Dr. Zangrillo later said that he had been speaking loosely and that he believes the virus is real.)\n\nDr. Zangrillo is also the personal doctor of Mr. Berlusconi, who is in a Milan hospital where his condition is said to be improving.\n\nMr. Briatore visited Mr. Berlusconi at his Villa Certosa on Aug. 11.\n\n\u201cVisit to a special friend,\u201d Mr. Briatore titled an Instagram post documenting the sumptuous seaside estate. In the post, Mr. Briatore pays tribute, saying he found Mr. Berlusconi in \u201cgreat form.\u201d\n\n\u201cA heartfelt thanks,\u201d Mr. Berlusconi replied.\n\nAfter making a political career out of victimization, Mr. Berlusconi this week seemed to have found a once-in-a-lifetime enemy: his coronavirus infection.\n\nIn a call on Tuesday to members of his party, Forza Italia, he said that hoped to return to political battle and that, out of all the thousands of tests conducted at the Milan hospital since the start of the epidemic, \u201cI have come out in the top five in terms of the strength of the virus.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fighting to beat this infernal disease,\u201d Mr. Berlusconi added, \u201cIt\u2019s very ugly.\u201d",

            "Text": "Corona dorms and student spreaders\nCases of coronavirus are spiking on university campuses, leaving administrators with two unappealing options: Quarantine students in dorms, or send them home.\n\nThe University of Alabama said it had recently posted university police officers at its quarantine dorms while Notre Dame said it had hired guards to monitor students in quarantine in hotels and off-campus apartments. And perhaps unsurprisingly, many schools are having trouble running what are essentially disease containment units.\n\nAt the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Brianna Hayes was assigned to a quarantine dorm after developing a fever. Two days later, the university informed her that she had tested positive and would need to move again, to a Covid-19 isolation dorm.\n\nThere was no university staff in the dorm to help sick students, Ms. Hayes said, and no elevator. Feverish and exhausted from the virus, she made four trips up and down staircases to move her bedding and other belongings to her isolation room. During her week in isolation, she said, no one from the university came to check on her.\n\n\u201cI felt like everyone was only interested in how I was affecting others, like who I came in contact with, and then I was just left to be sick,\u201d she told our colleague Natasha Singer.\n\nAs our sister newsletter The Morning noted, the alternative to quarantine dorms may be even worse: Sending potentially sick students back home, where they may spread the virus. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst thing you could do,\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci, the federal government\u2019s leading infectious disease expert, said on the \u201cToday\u201d show.\n\nSusan Dynarski, a University of Michigan economist, wrote on Twitter that \u201cunloading students onto home communities\u201d was \u201cdeeply unethical.\u201d\n\nAs outbreaks bloom from illegal student parties and the virus spreads through the dorms, colleges are the new meatpacking plants.\n\n\nImage The State University of New York at Oneonta ended in-person classes last week and sent students home after more than 650 people tested positive.\n\nNew York University has suspended some students (and might suspend more) after a gathering in Washington Square Park.\n\nWest Virginia University suspended some students after several large fraternity parties. It shifted most undergraduate classes online until late September.\n\nLast week, Northeastern University dismissed 11 freshmen from campus for the semester after an unmasked gathering. The school will not be refunding the $36,500 in tuition and fees they paid.\n\nIndiana University has identified 1,370 positive cases since Aug. 22, a vast majority on the flagship Bloomington campus.\n\nMore than 700 students at Florida State University tested positive in the past week. Right now, the Tallahassee metro area has the tenth-biggest spike in per-capita cases nationwide.\n\nRate my dashboard: Two professors at the Yale School of Medicine have started a Twitter account to evaluate coronavirus dashboards at universities. Think Room Rater, but for public health.\n\nEditors\u2019 Picks\n\nA Man, a Pint and a Timer Become Symbols of Ireland\u2019s Pandemic Rules\n\nJane Fonda, Intergalactic Eco-Warrior in a Red Coat\n\nChess (Yes, Chess) Is Now a Streaming Obsession\nContinue reading the main story\nHacking virtual learning\nThis school year already looked different \u2014 instead of buses and homeroom, it\u2019s Zoom rooms and social distanced desks. Now, even virtual spaces are feeling precarious.\n\nAdministrators in Hartford, Conn., had prepared for a hybrid reopening on Tuesday. But a ransomware attack \u2014 in which hackers locked people out of their networks and demanded big payments to get back in \u2014 forced the district to postpone classes for nearly 18,000 students. Schools reopened Wednesday.\n\nThat\u2019s not an isolated incident. Technology problems hindered 200,000 students in Houston and thousands more in Virginia Beach. Kids can\u2019t log on to supposedly secure portals. Video chats kick them out. Computers stall. Error messages multiply. Systems overload.\n\nThere were glitches and attacks well before Labor Day. There was a server issue in Philadelphia. A statewide outage in North Carolina. A teenage hacker choked the nation\u2019s fourth-largest school district, Miami-Dade County, for days.\n\nEven without hacks, students struggle to concentrate. Those with learning challenges have an even harder time. Younger children and children with special needs miss crucial social and emotional development socializing on Zoom. Kids starting new schools don\u2019t know how to make friends. And lower-income children may not have reliable internet or device access in the first place. \u201cI am at the point where I will have to let them fail Spanish, P.E. and music, because I can\u2019t manage their two schedules full-time on top of my full-time job,\u201d said Ally Fonte, a parent whose two sons attend school in Miami-Dade County, Fla.\n\nRead More: The 74 profiled the man running tech support for the San Antonio school district. His dedication to the \u201cbabies,\u201d his 48,000 students, has kept the district afloat.\n\nTests for kids? Good luck\nAs many parents have discovered, getting a kid tested for Covid-19 is no easy task. Even in large cities with many test sites, parents are spending hours on the phone and driving long distances to get their kids swabbed.\n\nSarah Kliff, an investigative reporter at The Times, started looking into the issue after an outbreak at her son\u2019s day care center. \u201cI just assumed, because I live in a large city with a lot of testing sites, that it would be easy,\u201d she said.\n\nWorking with our colleague Margot Sanger-Katz, and with help from the readers of this newsletter, Sarah found shortfalls across the country.\n\nIn Florida, the division of emergency management announced last month that it would \u201cprioritize\u201d pediatric testing as students there began to return to in-person school. Still, only a quarter of the 60 testing sites the agency supports will see children of all ages. The state\u2019s 18 drive-through sites are limited to patients 5 and older.\n\nSome cities, like Los Angeles, offer public testing to anyone. But others, like San Francisco and Dallas, have age cutoffs. In part, that\u2019s because of differences in health insurance and concerns about medical privacy. The challenge of administering an invasive test to squirming children also plays a role. \u201cKids weren\u2019t really out in the wider world when this whole testing infrastructure was set up,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cBut now they are. Day cares are reopening. Some students are going to school in person. We don\u2019t really have a testing infrastructure meant to handle that.\u201d\n\nLimited pediatric testing might stall a return to normalcy. Without reliable testing, schools and day care centers cannot quickly isolate and trace the virus following an outbreak.\n\nMargot and Sarah also wanted to thank everyone who wrote in to our call-out last week. Their story would not have been possible without your thoughtful, candid reflections.\n\nK-12 Updates\nIn the U.S.\nIn Iowa, leaders of the Des Moines Public Schools district are trying to figure out what to do now that a judge has denied their request to hold all classes remotely.\n\nBars in Ada County, Idaho, are allowed to reopen only after officials determined that school districts are at a lower risk than before.\n\nAt least 10 New York City public school buildings need repairs to their ventilation systems, and may have to delay the start of school past Sept. 21.\n\nA shortage of substitute teachers in New Jersey could delay the start of schools for some districts.\n\nAcross the country, parents and educators have raised privacy concerns about coronavirus dashboards. In Florida, where the State Department of Health has pushed for confidentiality, some districts are releasing information anyway in the name of transparency.\n\nOutside Detroit, one school has moved entirely outside, relying on nature to shape coursework and keep students safe. Other Michigan schools are doing the same.\n\nIn Colorado, a 12-year-old Black boy was suspended for having a toy gun in a virtual class, and the principal called the police.\n\nAround the world\nIn Spain, one of the hardest-hit countries in Europe, parents are revolting against the return to in-person classes.\n\nA week after children began returning to classrooms, a number of schools across England and Wales temporarily closed because of outbreaks.\n\nIn Iran, schools have reopened amid concerns from parents. \u201cHis health is a priority over education,\u201d one parent told Al Jazeera. \u201cThey\u2019re kids. They touch everything. And then they touch their faces.\u201d\n\nTeachers: How are you encouraging curiosity?\nIn a Times Op-Ed, Adam Grant and Allison Sweet Grant, a contributing writer and a psychiatric nurse practitioner, suggest that curiosity is one of most important things for learners right now.\n\nTeachers: Tell us your strategies for keeping kids curious, especially in virtual or hybrid learning. We may feature some in an upcoming newsletter, or in a future special section of the paper. Thanks!",

            "HeadLine": "Vaping Links to Covid Risk Are Becoming Clear",
            "Text": "Twenty-year-old Janan Moein vaped his first pen a year ago. By late fall, he was blowing through several THC-laced cartridges a week \u2014 more, he said, than most people can handle.\n\nThen in early December, he found himself in the emergency room of Sharp Grossmont Hospital in San Diego with a collapsed lung and a diagnosis of vaping-related lung illness. His hospital stay plunged him into a medically induced coma, forced him onto a breathing machine and stripped nearly 50 pounds off his 6-foot-1-inch frame in just two weeks.\n\nAt one point, Mr. Moein said, his doctors gave him a 5 percent chance of survival. He resolved that the wax pen he had vaped before his hospitalization would be his last.\n\nWhen he contracted a mild case of Covid-19 during a family barbecue three months ago, he knew he had quit not a moment too soon. \u201cIf I had caught Covid-19 within the week before I got really ill, I probably would have died,\u201d he said.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, experts have warned that the coronavirus \u2014 a respiratory pathogen \u2014 most likely capitalizes on the scarred lungs of smokers and vapers. Doctors and researchers are now starting to pinpoint the ways in which smoking and vaping seem to enhance the virus\u2019s ability to spread from person to person, infiltrate the lungs and spark some of Covid-19\u2019s worst symptoms.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt in saying that smoking and vaping could put people at increased risk of poor outcomes from Covid-19,\u201d said Dr. Stephanie Lovinsky-Desir, a pediatric pulmonologist at Columbia University. \u201cIt is quite clear that smoking and vaping are bad for the lungs, and the predominant symptoms of Covid are respiratory. Those two things are going to be bad in combination.\u201d Last year\u2019s vaping crisis, during which thousands of people like Mr. Moein were sickened and hospitalized with severe lung and respiratory illnesses, underscored the hazards of many e-cigarette and vaping products, especially illicitly sold marijuana-based vapes. But while several studies have found that smoking can more than double a person\u2019s risk of severe Covid-19 symptoms, the data on the relationship between vaping and Covid-19 are only beginning to emerge. A team of researchers recently reported that young adults who vape are five times more likely to receive a coronavirus diagnosis.\n\nMuch of what underlies the relationship between smoking, vaping and the coronavirus remains unclear. Doctors aren\u2019t sure why vaping makes some people seriously sick, but seems to spare others. And Mr. Moein\u2019s unexpectedly mild encounter with the coronavirus remains mysterious as well.\n\nThese and other lingering questions have made the risks of smoking and vaping during the pandemic tough to communicate. James Ippolito, a 26-year-old Army veteran who lives in Hingham, Mass., has been hooked on vaping nicotine for about six years. \u201cI vape every day, all day long,\u201d Mr. Ippolito said.\n\nThe looming threat of the virus doesn\u2019t intimidate him. \u201cI hate to say it, but if I got the virus, I would still be vaping \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t even think it was related,\u201d he said.\n\nSuch stubbornness troubles experts, who pointed out that Covid is hardly the first disease to hit smokers and vapers harder.\n\n\u201cLungs aren\u2019t designed to regularly breathe in smoke and vape,\u201d said Dr. Drew Harris, a pulmonologist at UVA Health in Virginia. These products, he added, \u201cdo just about everything bad you can think of.\u201d\n\nAbout 34 million adults smoke cigarettes in the United States, many of them from communities of color and low socioeconomic status \u2014 groups already known to be more vulnerable to the virus. And more than 5 million middle and high school students recently reported using vapes.\n\nThe active contents of cigarettes and vapes vary immensely, ranging from nicotine to THC, the high-inducing ingredient in marijuana. But many experts are more concerned about the other ingredients that tend to accompany them: additives like heavy metals and vitamin E acetate, which bathe the lung in toxins and ultrafine particles that can poison or pulverize delicate tissues.\n\nDecades of research have unmasked smoking\u2019s ability to put the immune system on the fritz. The punch of harmful chemicals packed into each puff is thought to discombobulate the system of checks and balances needed to direct disease-fighting cells and molecules toward harmful invaders like germs, while waylaying any misguided attacks on healthy tissues.\n\nA body hamstrung by a smoking habit can struggle to rouse a sufficient defense against viruses \u2014 but has little trouble turning its arsenal of weapons inward. Eventually, deteriorating lungs can become chronically inflamed and awash with mucus, narrowing the airways and stymieing the flow of oxygen into the blood. Certain patients may end up with lungs pockmarked by scar tissue, further impeding the movement of air.\n\nDr. Lovinsky-Desir describes the internal architecture of these tissues as bunches of gas-filled grapes, enmeshed in a network of blood vessels. \u201cChronic smoking destroys those grapes,\u201d she said. \u201cThey become saggy and floppy.\u201d\n\nSmoke can also compromise little hairlike structures known as cilia that boot toxins and microbes out of the airways, making it easier for pathogens to set up shop in the lungs.\n\n\nShould a virus then enter the mix, Dr. Lovinsky-Desir said, \u201cit will cause more destruction,\u201d clogging the already damaged grapes with a glut of cellular debris. Years of data have borne out these relationships. Smokers who catch the flu, for instance, are more likely than nonsmokers to wind up in the hospital.\n\nLess is known about vaping, a relative newcomer. But similar trends have been noted for e-cigarettes and vape pens. Several studies have shown that vaping makes mice more vulnerable to bacteria and viruses, and sends surges of inflammation throughout the body, beyond the boundaries of the lungs.\n\nMr. Moein was one of thousands who last year fell prey to a disease called e-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury, or Evali. Many Evali patients had vaped products containing a sticky substance called vitamin E acetate, which has been found in the branded Dr. Zodiak cartridges Mr. Moein preferred. Mr. Moein still recalls his hospital stay in vivid detail.\n\n\u201cMy lips were blue,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had to tape my eyes shut. I was hallucinating the entire time that the nurses were trying to kill me, that the walls were made of human skin. It was a really bad situation.\u201d\n\nNearly a year later, Mr. Moein, a towering athlete who played competitive sports in high school, said he was now once again \u201cvery healthy.\u201d\n\nBut Dr. Laura Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist and vaping expert at University of California San Diego and one of Mr. Moein\u2019s doctors, said experts were still teasing apart the potential long-term effects of vaping, even brushes briefer than his.\n\n\u201cJust because he feels 100 percent recovered doesn\u2019t mean his lung function returned to 100 percent,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter peaking last September, emergency department visits linked to Evali plummeted. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not updated their counts since February, leaving experts worried that concerns over vaping have fallen to the wayside. \u201cThis has not gone away from patients,\u201d said Michelle Eakin, a pulmonary disease expert at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nDr. Crotty Alexander noted that she and other researchers have struggled to follow up on many of last year\u2019s Evali cases, paradoxically thanks to a pandemic that might hit some of these patients especially hard.\n\nEarly evidence hints that the virus may have an easier time breaking into the bodies of smokers and vapers. Smoking appears to alter the surfaces of certain cells, prompting them to coat themselves with more of a molecule called ACE-2 \u2014 the protein the coronavirus uses to break into its targets.\n\n\u201cIf you have higher expression, you\u2019re going to have more virus entering cells,\u201d Dr. Crotty Alexander said. \u201cI\u2019m now seeing the same sort of data come out on the vaping side.\u201d\n\nThat pattern, layered on top of the ways in which vaping weakens the lungs, may help explain why a recent survey of more than 4,000 people ages 13 to 24 found that vaping was strongly linked to catching the coronavirus. But Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, a pediatrics researcher at Stanford University and an author on the study, said that there was probably more than biology at play.\n\nPeople who vape often do it socially, sharing spaces and equipment. And vaping, like smoking, involves a lot of hand-to-mouth movement, providing germs an easy path into the airway, Dr. Eakin said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re smoking or vaping,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019re not wearing a mask.\u201d Still unclear are the long-term consequences of Covid\u2019s effects on those who smoked or vaped. Accumulating evidence suggests that the coronavirus can wreak havoc on blood vessels, seeding clots that suffocate and warp tissues, including the lungs \u2014 most likely making any smoking or vaping after Covid even more dangerous than before.\n\n\u201cSome of these patients will have permanent issues,\u201d said Dr. Anne Melzer, a pulmonologist at the University of Minnesota.\n\nArlie Frahmann, a longtime smoker who picked up her first cigarette at the age of 9, hesitated to give up cigarettes when the coronavirus first infiltrated her community in Damariscotta, Maine, this spring. \u201cThe last thing I wanted was to be stressed out during quarantine,\u201d she said.\n\nAs of this week, though, Ms. Frahmann is eager to quit. She started a new job at a bakery, where she will have to interact with strangers.\n\n\u201cIt was one thing to explain it away to myself when I wasn\u2019t going into public at all,\u201d she said of her smoking. \u201cBut now I can\u2019t justify it.\u201d\n\nA few early reports suggest that some people may be shelving their cigarettes or vapes. As schools reopen for in-person learning, though, it might become easy to relapse.\n\nAnd Dr. Lovinsky-Desir worries that the stressors brought on by the pandemic may be pushing some people to smoke or vape even more.\n\nMr. Moein recalls brushing off warnings from his father, who used to send him articles about the dangers of vaping. \u201cI used to tell him, \u2018You\u2019re out of touch, vaping is safer,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAt one point, I was getting so many articles that I blocked his number.\u201d\n\nBut last year\u2019s events flipped Mr. Moein\u2019s worldview. The pandemic, he said, is another reminder that the risks of vaping simply aren\u2019t worth it: \u201cThere\u2019s no way in hell that vaping helps Covid-19.\u201d",

            "HeadLine": "Even Big Pharma Is Turning on Trump",
            "Text": "President Trump has become so shameless about subverting the public interest to his political self-interest that Big Pharma \u2014 not generally regarded as the most civic-minded of entities \u2014 is now scrambling to control the damage.\n\nOn Tuesday, nine drug companies issued a joint pledge that when it came to releasing a vaccine for the coronavirus, they would \u201cstand with science\u201d and \u201cmake the safety and well-being of vaccinated individuals our top priority.\u201d They vowed to follow the guidance of the appropriate regulators and to make decisions based on \u201clarge, high quality clinical studies,\u201d as is standard protocol.\n\n\u201cWe believe this pledge will help ensure public confidence in the rigorous scientific and regulatory process by which Covid-19 vaccines are evaluated and may ultimately be approved,\u201d the companies said.\n\nAs P.R. strategies go, it may seem odd for drugmakers to offer unsolicited assurances that they will not cut corners on safety. This feels a little bit like a server at Olive Garden greeting customers with a promise not to spit in their iced tea. Why even raise the possibility?\n\nSuch is the extent to which Mr. Trump has politicized and undermined public faith in everything \u2014 especially his own administration.\n\nHaving badly mishandled the pandemic and seen his job approval numbers suffer, Mr. Trump has been pressuring the Food and Drug Administration to crunch the vaccine timeline. He has even accused \u201cthe deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA\u201d of slow-walking the process expressly to undermine his re-election bid. The agency\u2019s commissioner, Stephen Hahn, has not exactly inspired confidence in his ability to withstand the presidential heat. During a White House appearance with Mr. Trump last month, Dr. Hahn grossly exaggerated the effectiveness of a Covid-19 treatment using convalescent plasma. The scientific community dogpiled on the commissioner, prompting him to issue an extended mea culpa on Twitter.\n\nWith increasing frequency and vigor, the president has been tantalizing voters with the promise of a vaccine becoming available before Election Day. In his speech at the Republican convention, he boasted that \u201cwe will have a safe and effective vaccine this year.\u201d That same day, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified state and local health officials to prepare to distribute a vaccine to high-risk groups by late October or early November.\n\nSince then, the president has repeatedly spoken of a vaccine as if it were some marvelous October Surprise. At a news briefing on Monday, he teased reporters: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a vaccine very soon. Maybe even before a very special date. You know what date I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\n\nEditors\u2019 Picks\n\nA Man, a Pint and a Timer Become Symbols of Ireland\u2019s Pandemic Rules\n\nJane Fonda, Intergalactic Eco-Warrior in a Red Coat\n\n\u2018Dwarf Pride\u2019 Was Hard Won. Will a Growth Drug Undermine It?\nContinue reading the main story\nHealth experts with actual scientific knowledge \u2014 including key administration officials involved in the development process \u2014 have suggested that this timeline is overly optimistic.\n\nThe politicization of the issue has unsettled voters. In a recent survey by the Harris Poll and STAT News, 78 percent of respondents \u2014 72 percent of Republicans and 82 percent of Democrats \u2014 expressed concern that the vaccine approval process was \u201cbeing driven more by politics than science.\u201d Eighty-three percent said that if a vaccine were approved quickly, they would worry about its safety.\n\nTo be fair, Mr. Trump did not single-handedly destroy the public\u2019s confidence in government regulators. Government-bashing has been a Republican staple for decades, with special enmity reserved for regulatory agencies, which, in the view of many conservatives, serve only to pervert the beauty and rationality of the market. As with so many of his party\u2019s longstanding lines of attack, Mr. Trump has distilled the disdain for government expertise and oversight to its toxic essence.\n\nOn one level, it\u2019s befuddling to see drug companies pitching themselves as guardians of the public good. Big Pharma has a well-earned reputation as being synonymous with Big Greed. Practically speaking, the new joint statement doesn\u2019t do all that much. It is, for instance, somewhat vague about precisely what requirements the companies would meet before seeking emergency authorization.\n\nBut from a messaging standpoint, the pledge is illuminating. Even the most avaricious drug executives recognize that absent a baseline of public confidence in their products, the companies\u2019 bottom lines will suffer. Mr. Trump is destroying that baseline.\n\nVaccine safety was already a sensitive subject. Anti-vaxxers stand ready to spread fear and conspiracy theories without any political provocation. (The \u201cPlandemic\u201d conspiracy that exploded on social media, which claims the coronavirus is the handiwork of a sinister band of elites, features a big dose of anti-vax nuttiness.) The last thing drug companies want is for the president to fuel fears about the integrity of a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nLast weekend, Kamala Harris, Joe Biden\u2019s newly minted running mate, voiced hesitation about receiving any vaccine that might emerge before Election Day. \u201cI would not trust Donald Trump, and it would have to be a credible source of information that talks about the efficacy and the reliability of whatever he\u2019s talking about,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cI will not take his word for it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to fault Ms. Harris when just this week, excerpts from Bob Woodward\u2019s new book, \u201cRage,\u201d reveal that the president knew back in February that the coronavirus was \u201cdeadly stuff\u201d but intentionally misled the public. \u201cI wanted to always play it down,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nWhen the president cannot serve as a credible source on matters of life and death, whom can the nation turn to? Drug executives clearly aren\u2019t the only ones fretting over that question.",

            "Text": "The joint statement by competitors was seen as an effort to restore public trust as President Trump has pushed for a vaccine before the presidential election. Nine pharmaceutical companies issued a joint pledge on Tuesday that they would \u201cstand with science\u201d and not put forward a vaccine until it had been thoroughly vetted for safety and efficacy.\n\nThe companies did not rule out seeking an emergency authorization of their vaccines, but promised that any potential coronavirus vaccine would be decided based on \u201clarge, high quality clinical trials\u201d and that the companies would follow guidance from regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\u201cWe believe this pledge will help ensure public confidence in the rigorous scientific and regulatory process by which Covid-19 vaccines are evaluated and may ultimately be approved,\u201d the companies said.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly claimed in recent weeks that a vaccine could be available before Election Day \u2014 Nov. 3 \u2014 heightening fears that his administration is politicizing the race to develop a vaccine and potentially undermining public trust in any vaccine approved.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have the vaccine soon, maybe before a special date,\u201d the president said on Monday. \u201cYou know what date I\u2019m talking about.\u201d The move was welcomed by some researchers who said that the statement could increase public confidence in a coronavirus vaccine at a time when skepticism was running high. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely a desperate need for this vaccine,\u201d said Dr. Judith Feinberg, the vice chairwoman for research in medicine at West Virginia University in Morgantown. \u201cI love the fact that the nine big vaccine manufacturers today said they would not do anything premature \u2014 I think there\u2019s enormous pressure to do something premature.\u201d Three of the companies that signed the pledge are testing their candidate vaccines in late-stage clinical trials in the United States: Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca.\n\nPfizer has said repeatedly over the past week that it could apply to the F.D.A. for emergency approval as early as October. On Tuesday, its chief executive, Dr. Albert Bourla, predicted in an interview on the \u201cToday\u201d show on NBC that the company would have an answer about whether its vaccine worked by the end of October, but acknowledged that did not mean its vaccine would be available to the public by then.\n\nModerna and AstraZeneca have been less specific, saying only they hope to have a vaccine by the end of the year. Last week, Moderna\u2019s chief executive said the company was slightly slowing its enrollment in order to include more people from groups that had been most affected by Covid-19.\n\nEditors\u2019 Picks\n\nA Man, a Pint and a Timer Become Symbols of Ireland\u2019s Pandemic Rules\n\nJane Fonda, Intergalactic Eco-Warrior in a Red Coat\n\n\u2018Dwarf Pride\u2019 Was Hard Won. Will a Growth Drug Undermine It?\nContinue reading the main story\nPfizer and Moderna are each close to fully enrolling the 30,000 participants in each of their trials, with some analysts predicting they will be finished within the next two weeks. AstraZeneca is further behind in its U.S. trials, having begun enrollment on Aug. 31. Federal officials have been pushing back against Mr. Trump\u2019s enthusiastic predictions. Late last week, Moncef Slaoui, the top scientist on Operation Warp Speed, the federal effort to quickly bring a vaccine to market, warned in an interview with National Public Radio that the chance of successful vaccine results by October was \u201cvery, very low.\u201d\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said he believed that researchers would know whether the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were effective by \u201cNovember or December.\u201d\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Dr. Slaoui said the goal of Operation Warp Speed was \u201cto ensure that no technical, logistic or financial hurdles hinder vaccine development or deployment without curtailing the critical steps required by sound science and regulatory standards.\u201d He added that the pledge \u201creiterates the position of Operation Warp Speed, that this project is driven by science and that any vaccine must meet the gold standard of the Food and Drug Administration.\u201d\n\nDrug companies have had to carefully navigate the political landscape. A successful vaccine could help restore the industry\u2019s battered image and offer an end to the pandemic. But rushing a vaccine to market that winds up causing serious side effects \u2014 or simply does not work \u2014 could do catastrophic damage to their reputations.\n\nIn the nine companies\u2019 statement on Tuesday, they did not mention Mr. Trump, saying only that they have \u201ca united commitment to uphold the integrity of the scientific process.\u201d\n\nThe other six companies that signed the pledge were BioNTech, which is developing the vaccine in partnership with Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Novavax and Sanofi.",

            "Text": "Key findings are summarized here.\nConcentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA measured in upper respiratory specimens decline after onset of symptoms (CDC, unpublished data, 2020; Midgley et al., 2020; Young et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2020; W\u00f6lfel et al., 2020; van Kampen et al., 2020).\nThe likelihood of recovering replication-competent virus also declines after onset of symptoms. For patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, replication-competent virus has not been recovered after 10 days following symptom onset (CDC, unpublished data, 2020; W\u00f6lfel et al., 2020; Arons et al., 2020; Bullard et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; personal communication with Young et al., 2020; Korea CDC, 2020). Recovery of replication-competent virus between 10 and 20 days after symptom onset has been documented in some persons with severe COVID-19 that, in some cases, was complicated by immunocompromised state (van Kampen et al., 2020). However, in this series of patients, it was estimated that 88% and 95% of their specimens no longer yielded replication-competent virus after 10 and 15 days, respectively, following symptom onset.\nA large contact tracing study demonstrated that high-risk household and hospital contacts did not develop infection if their exposure to a case patient started 6 days or more after the case patient\u2019s illness onset (Cheng et al., 2020).\nAlthough replication-competent virus was not isolated 3 weeks after symptom onset, recovered patients can continue to have SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in their upper respiratory specimens for up to 12 weeks (Korea CDC, 2020; Li et al., 2020; Xiao et al, 2020). Investigation of 285 \u201cpersistently positive\u201d persons, which included 126 persons who had developed recurrent symptoms, found no secondary infections among 790 contacts attributable to contact with these case patients. Efforts to isolate replication-competent virus from 108 of these case patients were unsuccessful (Korea CDC, 2020).\nSpecimens from patients who recovered from an initial COVID-19 illness and subsequently developed new symptoms and retested positive by RT-PCR did not have replication-competent virus detected (Korea CDC, 2020; Lu et al., 2020). The risk of reinfection may be lower in the first 3 months after initial infection, based on limited evidence from another betacoronavirus (HCoV-OC43), the genus to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs (Kiyuka et al, 2018).\nCurrently, 6 months after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, there have been no confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. However, the number of areas where sustained infection pressure has been maintained, and therefore reinfections would be most likely observed, remains limited.\nSerologic or other correlates of immunity have not yet been established.\nThe current evidence includes the following caveats:\n\nIn a recent study of skilled nursing facility workers followed prospectively for asymptomatic infection, one of 48 infected staff had a nasopharyngeal swab which was weakly positive on a single-passage plaque assay more than 20 days after initial diagnosis; however, the specimen was not subjected to serial passage to demonstrate the presence of replication-competent virus (Quicke et al., 2020).\nIn one case report, a person with mild illness provided specimens that yielded replication-competent virus for up to 18 days after symptom onset (Liu et al., 2020).\nData currently available are derived from adults; equivalent data from children and infants are not presently available.\nMore data are needed concerning viral shedding in some situations, including in immunocompromised persons.\nAssessment\nAvailable data indicate that persons with mild to moderate COVID-19 remain infectious no longer than 10 days after symptom onset. Persons with more severe to critical illness or severe immunocompromise likely remain infectious no longer than 20 days after symptom onset.  Recovered persons can continue to shed detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory specimens for up to 3 months after illness onset, albeit at concentrations considerably lower than during illness, in ranges where replication-competent virus has not been reliably recovered and infectiousness is unlikely. The etiology of this persistently detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA has yet to be determined. Studies have not found evidence that clinically recovered persons with persistence of viral RNA have transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to others. These findings strengthen the justification for relying on a symptom based, rather than test-based strategy for ending isolation of these patients, so that persons who are by current evidence no longer infectious are not kept unnecessarily isolated and excluded from work or other responsibilities.\n\nReinfection with SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been definitively confirmed in any recovered persons to date. If, and if so when, persons can be reinfected with SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown and is a subject of investigation. Persons infected with related endemic human betacoronavirus appear to become susceptible again at around 90 days after onset of  infection. Thus, for persons recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, a positive PCR during the 90 days after illness onset more likely represents persistent shedding of viral RNA than reinfection.\n\nIf such a person remains asymptomatic during this 90-day period, then any re-testing is unlikely to yield useful information, even if the person had close contact with an infected person.\nIf such a person becomes symptomatic during this 90-day period and an evaluation fails to identify a diagnosis other than SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g., influenza), then the person may warrant evaluation for SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in consultation with an infectious disease or infection control expert. Isolation may be warranted during this evaluation, particularly if symptoms developed after close contact with an infected person.\nCorrelates of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been established. Specifically, the utility of serologic testing to establish the absence or presence of infection or reinfection remains undefined.\n\nThe recommendations below are based on the best information available in mid-July 2020 and reflect the realities of an evolving pandemic. Even for pathogens for which many years of data are available, it may not be possible to establish recommendations that ensure 100% of persons who are shedding replication-competent virus remain isolated. CDC will continue to closely monitor the evolving science for information that would warrant reconsideration of these recommendations.\n\nRecommendations\nDuration of isolation and precautions\nFor most persons with COVID-19 illness, isolation and precautions can generally be discontinued 10 days after symptom onset1 and resolution of fever for at least 24 hours, without the use of fever-reducing medications, and with improvement of other symptoms.\nA limited number of persons with severe illness may produce replication-competent virus beyond 10 days that may warrant extending duration of isolation and precautions for up to 20 days after symptom onset; consider consultation with infection control experts.\nFor persons who never develop symptoms, isolation and other precautions can be discontinued 10 days after the date of their first positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.\nRole of PCR testing2 to discontinue isolation or precautions\nFor persons who are severely immunocompromised, a test-based strategy could be considered in consultation with infectious diseases experts.\nFor all others, a test-based strategy is no longer recommended except to discontinue isolation or precautions earlier than would occur under the strategy outlined in Part 1, above.\nRole of PCR testing2 after discontinuation of isolation or precautions\nFor persons previously diagnosed with symptomatic COVID-19 who remain asymptomatic after recovery, retesting is not recommended within 3 months after the date of symptom onset for the initial COVID-19 infection.\nFor persons who develop new symptoms consistent with COVID-19 during the 3 months after the date of initial symptom onset, if an alternative etiology cannot be identified by a provider, then the person may warrant retesting; consultation with infectious disease or infection control experts is recommended. Isolation may be considered during this evaluation based on consultation with an infection control expert, especially in the event symptoms develop within 14 days after close contact with an infected person.\nFor persons who never developed symptoms, the date of first positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA should be used in place of the date of symptom onset.\nRole of serologic testing\nSerologic testing should not be used to establish the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or reinfection.",

            "Text": "Background\nThere is much to learn about the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Based on what is currently known about the virus and about similar coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS, spread from person-to-person happens most frequently among close contacts (within about 6 feet). This type of transmission occurs via respiratory droplets, but disease transmission via infectious aerosols is currently uncertain. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to persons from surfaces contaminated with the virus has not been documented. Transmission of coronavirus occurs much more commonly through respiratory droplets than through objects and surfaces, like doorknobs, countertops, keyboards, toys, etc. Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in community settings.\n\nIt is unknown how long the air inside a room occupied by someone with confirmed COVID-19 remains potentially infectious. Facilities will need to consider factors such as the size of the room and the ventilation system design (including flowrate [air changes per hour] and location of supply and exhaust vents) when deciding how long to close off rooms or areas used by ill persons before beginning disinfection. Taking measures to improve ventilation in an area or room where someone was ill or suspected to be ill with COVID-19 will help shorten the time it takes respiratory droplets to be removed from the air. Purpose\nThis guidance provides recommendations on the cleaning and disinfection of rooms or areas occupied by those with suspected or with confirmed COVID-19. It is aimed at limiting the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in key environments. These recommendations will be updated if additional information becomes available.\n\nThese guidelines are focused on community, non-healthcare facilities such as schools, institutions of higher education, offices, daycare centers, businesses, and community centers that do, and do not, house persons overnight. These guidelines are not meant  for cleaning staff in healthcare facilities or repatriation sites, households, or for others for whom specific guidance already exists.\n\nDefinitions\nCommunity facilities such as schools, daycare centers, and businesses comprise most non-healthcare settings that are visited by the general public outside of a household.\nCleaning refers to the removal of dirt and impurities, including germs, from surfaces. Cleaning alone does not kill germs. But by removing the germs, it decreases their number and therefore any risk of spreading infection.\nDisinfecting works by using chemicals, for example EPA-registered disinfectants, to kill germs on surfaces. This process does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs. But killing germs remaining on a surface after cleaning further reduces any risk of spreading infection.\nCleaning and Disinfection After Persons Suspected/Confirmed to Have COVID-19 Have Been in the Facility\nTiming and location of cleaning and disinfection of surfaces\n\nAt a school, daycare center, office, or other facility that does not house people overnight:\n Close off areas visited by the ill persons. Open outside doors and windows and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. Wait 24 hours or as long as practical before beginning cleaning and disinfection.\nCleaning staff should clean and disinfect all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment (like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines) used by the ill persons, focusing especially on frequently touched surfaces.\nAt a facility that does house people overnight:\nFollow Interim Guidance for US Institutions of Higher Education on working with state and local health officials to isolate ill persons and provide temporary housing as needed.\nClose off areas visited by the ill persons. Open outside doors and windows and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. Wait 24 hours or as long as practical before beginning cleaning and disinfection.\nIn areas where ill persons are being housed in isolation, follow Interim Guidance for Environmental Cleaning and Disinfection for U.S. Households with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019. This includes focusing on cleaning and disinfecting common areas where staff/others providing services may come into contact with ill persons but reducing cleaning and disinfection of bedrooms/bathrooms used by ill persons to as-needed.\nIn areas where ill persons have visited or used, continue routine cleaning and disinfection as in this guidance.\nIf it has been more than 7 days since the person with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 visited or used the facility, additional cleaning and disinfection is not necessary.\nHow to Clean and Disinfect\nHard (non-porous) surfaces\n\nWear disposable gloves when cleaning and disinfecting surfaces. Gloves should be discarded after each cleaning. If reusable gloves are used, those gloves should be dedicated for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces for COVID-19 and should not be used for other purposes. Consult the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for cleaning and disinfection products used. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed.\nIf surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.\nAlways read and follow the directions on the label to ensure safe and effective use.\n\nWear skin protection and consider eye protection for potential splash hazards\nEnsure adequate ventilation\nUse no more than the amount recommended on the label\nUse water at room temperature for dilution (unless stated otherwise on the label)\nAvoid mixing chemical products\nLabel diluted cleaning solutions\nStore and use chemicals out of the reach of children and pets\nYou should never eat, drink, breathe or inject these products into your body or apply directly to your skin as they can cause serious harm. Do not wipe or bathe pets with these products or any other products that are not approved for animal use.\n\nSee EPA\u2019s 6 steps for Safe and Effective Disinfectant Useexternal icon.\n\nSpecial considerations should be made for people with asthma and they should not be present when cleaning and disinfecting is happening as this can trigger asthma exacerbations. Learn more about reducing asthma triggers.\n\nDisinfect with a household disinfectant on List N: Disinfectants for use against SARs-CoV-2external icon, the virus that causes COVID 19. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. Read the product label for the correct concentration to use, application method, and contact time.\nDiluted household bleach solutions can be used if appropriate for the surface. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted:\nUse bleach containing 5.25%\u20138.25% sodium hypochlorite. Do not use a bleach product if the percentage is not in this range or is not specified.\nFollow the manufacturer\u2019s application instructions for the surface, ensuring a contact time of at least 1 minute.\nEnsure proper ventilation during and after application.\nCheck to ensure the product is not past its expiration date.\nNever mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. This can cause fumes that may be very dangerous to breathe in.\nPrepare a bleach solution by mixing:\n5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) of 5.25%\u20138.25% bleach per gallon of room temperature water or\n4 teaspoons of 5.25%\u20138.25% bleach per quart of room temperature water\nBleach solutions will be effective for disinfection up to 24 hours.\nAlcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol may also be used.\nCleaning staff and others should clean hands often, including immediately after removing gloves and after contact with an ill person, by washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water.\nAlways read and follow the directions on the label to ensure safe and effective use.\n\nKeep hand sanitizers away from fire or flame\nFor children under six years of age, hand sanitizer should be used with adult supervision\nAlways store hand sanitizer out of reach of children and pets\nSee FDA\u2019s Tips for Safe Sanitizer Useexternal iconexternal icon and CDC's Hand Sanitizer Use Considerations\n\nFollow normal preventive actions while at work and home, including cleaning hands and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.\nAdditional key times to clean hands include:\nAfter blowing one\u2019s nose, coughing, or sneezing.\nAfter using the restroom.\nBefore eating or preparing food.\nAfter contact with animals or pets.\nBefore and after providing routine care for another person who needs assistance such as a child.\nSoft (porous) surfaces\n\nFor soft (porous) surfaces such as carpeted floor, rugs, and drapes, remove visible contamination if present and clean with appropriate cleaners indicated for use on these surfaces. After cleaning:\nIf the items can be laundered, launder items in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and then dry items completely.\nOtherwise, use products that are EPA-approved for use against the virus that causes COVID-19external icon and that are suitable for porous surfaces\nElectronics\n\nFor electronics such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines, remove visible contamination if present.\nFollow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products.\nConsider use of wipeable covers for electronics.\nIf no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or sprays containing at least 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids.\nL\u200binens, clothing, and other items that go in the laundry\u200b\n\nIn order to minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air, do not shake dirty laundry.\nWash items as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. Dirty laundry that has been in contact with an ill person can be washed with other people\u2019s items.\nClean and disinfect hampers or other carts for transporting laundry according to guidance above for hard or soft surfaces.\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE) and Hand Hygiene\nThe risk of exposure to cleaning staff is inherently low. Cleaning staff should wear disposable gloves and gowns for all tasks in the cleaning process, including handling trash.\nGloves and gowns should be compatible with the disinfectant products being used.\nAdditional PPE might be required based on the cleaning/disinfectant products being used and whether there is a risk of splash.\nGloves and gowns should be removed carefully to avoid contamination of the wearer and the surrounding area. Be sure to clean hands after removing gloves.\nIf gowns are not available, coveralls, aprons or work uniforms can be worn during cleaning and disinfecting. Reusable (washable) clothing should be laundered afterwards. Clean hands after handling dirty laundry.\nGloves should be removed after cleaning a room or area occupied by ill persons. Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed.\nCleaning staff should immediately report breaches in PPE such as a tear in gloves or any other potential exposures to their supervisor.\nCleaning staff and others should clean hands often, including immediately after removing gloves and after contact with an ill person, by washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available and hands are not visibly dirty, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol may be used. However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water.\nFollow normal preventive actions while at work and home, including cleaning hands and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.\nAdditional key times to clean hands include:\nAfter blowing one\u2019s nose, coughing, or sneezing.\nAfter using the restroom.\nBefore eating or preparing food.\nAfter contact with animals or pets.\nBefore and after providing routine care for another person who needs assistance such as a child.",

            "Text": "Clinical Presentation\nIncubation period\nThe incubation period for COVID-19 is thought to extend to 14 days, with a median time of 4-5 days from exposure to symptoms onset.1-3 One study reported that 97.5% of persons with COVID-19 who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection.3\n\nPresentation\nThe signs and symptoms of COVID-19 present at illness onset vary, but over the course of the disease, most persons with COVID-19 will experience the following1,4-9:\n\nFever or chills\nCough\nShortness of breath or difficulty breathing\nFatigue\nMuscle or body aches\nHeadache\nNew loss of taste or smell\nSore throat\nCongestion or runny nose\nNausea or vomiting\nDiarrhea\nSymptoms differ with severity of disease.  For example, fever, cough, and shortness of breath are more commonly reported among people who are hospitalized with COVID-19 than among those with milder disease (non-hospitalized patients). Atypical presentations occur often, and older adults and persons with medical comorbidities may have delayed presentation of fever and respiratory symptoms.10,14 In one study of 1,099 hospitalized patients, fever was present in only 44% at hospital admission but eventually developed in 89% during hospitalization.1 Fatigue, headache, and muscle aches (myalgia) are among the most commonly reported symptoms in people who are not hospitalized, and sore throat and nasal congestion or runny nose (rhinorrhea) also may be prominent symptoms.  Many people with COVID-19  experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, sometimes prior to developing fever and lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms.9 Loss of smell (anosmia) or taste (ageusia) preceding the onset of respiratory symptoms has been commonly reported in COVID-19 especially among women and young or middle-aged patients who do not require hospitalization.11,12 While many of the symptoms of COVID-19 are common to other respiratory or viral illnesses, anosmia appears to be more specific to COVID-19.12\n\nSeveral studies have reported that the signs Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in children are similar to adults vary by age of the child,  and are usually milder compared to adults.15-19 For more information on the clinical presentation and course among children, see Information for Pediatric Healthcare Providers.\n\nAsymptomatic and Pre-Symptomatic Infection\nSeveral studies have documented SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) and in patients not yet symptomatic (pre-symptomatic).16,18,20-30 Since asymptomatic persons are not routinely tested, the prevalence of asymptomatic infection and detection of pre-symptomatic infection is not yet well understood. One study found that as many as 13% of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children were asymptomatic.16 Another study of skilled nursing facility residents who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 after contact with a healthcare worker with COVID-19 demonstrated that half of the residents were asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic at the time of contact tracing, evaluation, and testing.27 Patients may have abnormalities on chest imaging before the onset of symptoms.21,22.\n\nAsymptomatic and Pre-Symptomatic Transmission\nIncreasing numbers of epidemiologic studies have documented SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the pre-symptomatic incubation period,21,31-33. Virologic studies using RT-PCR detection have reported tests with  low cycle thresholds, indicating larger quantities of viral RNA and viable virus has been cultured from persons with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.25,27,30,34 The relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA shedding and  transmission risk is not yet clear. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission due to asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infection compared to symptomatic infection is unclear.35\n\nClinical Course\nIllness Severity\nThe largest cohort reported of >44,000 persons with COVID-19 from China showed that illness severity can range from mild to critical:36\n\nMild to moderate (mild symptoms up to mild pneumonia): 81%\nSevere (dyspnea, hypoxia, or >50% lung involvement on imaging): 14%\nCritical (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan system dysfunction): 5%\nIn this study, all deaths occurred among patients with critical illness, and the overall case fatality rate was 2.3%.36 The case fatality rate among patients with critical disease was 49%.36 Among children in China, illness severity was lower with 94% having asymptomatic, mild, or moderate disease; 5% having severe disease; and <1% having critical disease.16 Among U.S. COVID-19 cases with known disposition, the proportion of persons who were hospitalized was 19%.37 The proportion of persons with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) was 6%.37\n\nClinical Progression\nAmong patients who developed severe disease, the median time to dyspnea from the onset of illness or symptoms ranged from 5 to 8 days, the median time to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from the onset of illness or symptoms ranged from 8 to 12 days, and the median time to ICU admission from the onset of illness or symptoms ranged from 10 to 12 days.5,6,10,11 Clinicians should be aware of the potential for some patients to rapidly deteriorate one week after illness onset. Among all hospitalized patients, a range of 26% to 32% of patients were admitted to the ICU.6,8,11 Among all patients, a range of 3% to 17% developed ARDS compared to a range of 20% to 42% for hospitalized patients and 67% to 85% for patients admitted to the ICU.1,4-6,8,11 Mortality among patients admitted to the ICU ranges from 39% to 72% depending on the study and characteristics of patient population.5,8,10,11 The median length of hospitalization among survivors was 10 to 13 days.1,6,8\n\nRisk Factors for Severe Illness\nAge is a strong risk factor for severe illness, complications, and death.1,6,8,14,36-40 Among >44,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, the case fatality rate was highest among older persons: \u226580 years, 14.8%; 70\u201379 years, 8.0%; 60\u201369 years, 3.6%; 50\u201359 years, 1.3%; 40\u201349 years, 0.4%; <40 years, 0.2%.36,41 In early U.S. epidemiologic data, case fatality was highest in persons aged \u226585 years (range 10%\u201327%), followed by those aged 65-84 years (3%\u201311%), aged 55-64 years (1%\u20133%), and aged <55 years (<1%).37\n\nPatients in China with no reported underlying medical conditions had an overall case fatality of 0.9%. Case fatality was higher for patients with comorbidities: 10.5% for those with cardiovascular disease, 7.3% for those with diabetes, and approximately 6% for those with chronic respiratory disease, or cancer.1,6,14,36,38,41,42    Prior stroke, diabetes, chronic lung disease, and chronic kidney disease have all been associated with increased illness severity and adverse outcomes. Serious heart conditions, including heart failure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and pulmonary hypertension, may put people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. People with hypertension may be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 and should continue to take their medications as prescribed. At this time, people whose only underlying medical condition is hypertension are not considered to be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.43,44\n\nAccounting for differences in age and prevalence of underlying condition, mortality associated with COVID-19 reported in the United States has been similar to reports from China.26,37,39\n\nReinfection\nThere are limited data about reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 after recovery from COVID-19.\u200b84, 85 While viral RNA shedding declines with resolution of symptoms, it may continue for days to weeks.34,38,45 However, the detection of RNA during convalescence does not necessarily indicate the presence of viable infectious virus. Clinical infection has been correlated with the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies.46-49 However, definitive data are lacking, and it remains uncertain whether individuals with antibodies are protected against reinfection with SARS-CoV-2, and if so, what concentration of antibodies is needed to confer protection.\n\nViral Testing\nDiagnosis of COVID-19 requires detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA is better in nasopharynx samples compared to throat samples.34,50 Lower respiratory samples may have better yield than upper respiratory samples.34,50 SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected in stool and blood.15,45,47,51 Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood may be a marker of severe illness.52 Viral RNA shedding may persist over longer periods among older persons and those who had severe illness requiring hospitalization (median range of viral shedding among hospitalized patients 12\u201320 days).34,38,45,46,53\n\nInfection with both SARS-CoV-2 and with other respiratory viruses has been reported, and detection of another respiratory pathogen does not rule out COVID-19.54\n\nFor more information about testing and specimen collection, handling and storage, visit Evaluating and Testing Persons for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Frequently Asked Questions on COVID-19 Testing at Laboratories.\n\nLaboratory and Radiographic Findings\nLaboratory Findings\nLymphopenia is the most common laboratory finding in COVID-19, and is found in as many as 83% of hospitalized patients.1,5 Lymphopenia, neutrophilia, elevated serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, high CRP, and high ferritin levels may be associated with greater illness severity.1,5,6,8,38,55 Elevated D-dimer and lymphopenia have been associated with mortality.8,38 Procalcitonin is typically normal on admission, but may increase among those admitted to an ICU.4-6 Patients with critical illness had high plasma levels of inflammatory makers, suggesting potential immune dysregulation.5,56\n\nRadiographic Findings\nChest radiographs of patients with COVID-19 typically demonstrate bilateral air-space consolidation, though patients may have unremarkable chest radiographs early in the disease.1,5,57 Chest CT images from patients with COVID-19 typically demonstrate bilateral, peripheral ground glass opacities.4,8,36,58-67 Because this chest CT imaging pattern is non-specific and overlaps with other infections, the diagnostic value of chest CT imaging for COVID-19 may be low and dependent upon radiographic interpretation.59,68 One study found that 56% of patients who presented within two days of diagnosis had a normal CT.60 Conversely, other studies have identified chest CT abnormalities in patients prior to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.58,69 Given the variability in chest imaging findings, chest radiograph or CT alone is not recommended for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The American College of Radiology also does not recommend CT for screening, or as a first-line test for diagnosis of COVID-19. (See American College of Radiology Recommendationsexternal icon).\n\nClinical Management and Treatment\nThe National Institutes of Health published guidelines on prophylaxis use, testing, and management of patients with COVID-19. For more information, please visit National Institutes of Health: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Treatment Guidelinesexternal icon. The recommendations were based on scientific evidence and expert opinion and will be updated as more data become available.\n\nMild to Moderate Disease\nPatients with a mild clinical presentation (absence of viral pneumonia and hypoxia) may not initially require hospitalization, and many patients will be able to manage their illness at home. The decision to monitor a patient in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision will depend on the clinical presentation, requirement for supportive care, potential risk factors for severe disease, and the ability of the patient to self-isolate at home. Patients with risk factors for severe illness (see People Who Are at Higher Risk for Severe Illness) should be monitored closely given the possible risk of progression to severe illness, especially in the second week after symptom onset.5,6,14,38\n\nFor information regarding infection prevention and control recommendations, please see Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings.\n\nSevere Disease\nSome patients with COVID-19 will have severe disease requiring hospitalization for management. Inpatient management revolves around the supportive management of the most common complications of severe COVID-19: pneumonia, hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS, sepsis and septic shock, cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia, acute kidney injury, and complications from prolonged hospitalization, including secondary bacterial infections, thromboembolism, gastrointestinal bleeding, and critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy.1,4-6,14,36,38,70-73\n\nMore information can be found at National Institutes of Health: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Treatment Guidelinesexternal icon and Healthcare Professionals: Frequently Asked Questions and Answers. Additional resources and guidance documents on the treatment and management of COVID-19, including inpatient management of critically ill patients, are provided below.\n\nHypercoagulability and COVID-19\nSome patients with COVID-19 may develop signs of a hypercoagulable state and be at increased risk for venous and arterial thrombosis of large and small vessels.74,75  Laboratory abnormalities commonly observed among hospitalized patients with COVID-19-associated coagulopathy include:\n\nMild thrombocytopenia\nIncreased D-dimer levels\nIncreased fibrin degradation products\nProlonged prothrombin time\nElevated D-dimer levels have been strongly associated with greater risk of death.74,76-79\n\nThere are several reports of hospitalized patients with thrombotic complications, most frequently deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.80-82 Other reported manifestations include:\n\nMicrovascular thrombosis of the toes\nClotting of catheters\nMyocardial injury with ST-segment elevation\nLarge vessel strokes83-86\nThe pathogenesis for COVID-19-associated hypercoagulability remains unknown. However, hypoxia and systemic inflammation secondary to COVID-19 may lead to high levels of inflammatory cytokines and activation of the coagulation pathway.\n\nThere are limited data available to inform clinical management around prophylaxis or treatment of venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients.\n\nSeveral national professional associations provide resources for up-to-date information concerning COVID-19-associated hypercoagulability, including management of anticoagulation. This is a rapidly evolving topic, with new information released often.\n\nMore information on hypercoagulability and COVID-19 is available from the American Society of Hematology external iconand National Institutes of Health: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Treatment Guidelines \u2013 Antithrombotic Therapy in Patients with COVID-19external icon.\n\nPediatric Management\nIllness among pediatric patients with COVID-19 is typically milder than among adults. Most children present with symptoms of upper respiratory infection. However, severe outcomes have been reported in children, including deaths. Data suggest that infants (<12 months of age) may be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 compared with older children.16 CDC and partners are also investigating reports of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19.\n\nFor expanded guidance on the management of children with COVID-19 and associated complications, see Evaluation and Management Considerations for Neonates At Risk for COVID-19, Information for Pediatric Healthcare Providers, and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign International Guidelines for the Management of Septic Shock and Sepsis-Associated Organ Dysfunction in Childrenexternal icon.\n\nInvestigational Therapeutics\nThe National Institutes of Health have published interim guidelines for the medical management of COVID-19external icon which include information on therapeutic options for COVID-19 currently under investigation. No U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs have demonstrated safety and efficacy in randomized controlled trials when used to treat patients with COVID-19, although FDA has granted an Emergency Use Authorization for the use of remdesivirexternal icon to treat severe cases. Use of investigational therapies for treatment of COVID-19 should ideally be done in the context of enrollment in randomized controlled trials, so that beneficial drugs can be identified. For the latest information, see Information for Clinicians on Therapeutic Options for COVID-19 Patients. For information on registered trials in the United States, see ClinicalTrials.govexternal icon.\n\nDiscontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions or Home Isolation\nPatients who have clinically recovered and are able to discharge from the hospital, but who have not been cleared from their Transmission-Based Precautions, may continue isolation at their place of residence until cleared. For recommendations on discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions or home isolation for patients who have recovered from COVID-19, please see:\n\nInterim Guidance for Discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions and Disposition of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19\nInterim Guidance for Discontinuation of In-Home Isolation for Patients with COVID-19",

            "Text": "We are still learning about how the virus that causes COVID-19 can affect animals.  A small number of pets (cats and dogs) have been confirmed to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with a person with COVID-19. Some pets did not show any signs of illness, but those pets that did get sick all had mild disease that could be taken care of at home. None of the pets have died. Tests for COVID-19 in animals are available for most types of pets, but testing is only recommended for animals with COVID-19 symptoms and that have been exposed to a person with COVID-19.\n\nBased on the limited information available now, the risk of pets spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. There is no reason to abandon or surrender pets that have been confirmed positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nIf you are sick with COVID-19, do not take your pet to the veterinary clinic yourself.  Call your veterinarian first and tell them you are sick with COVID-19. Some veterinarians may offer telemedicine consultations or other plans for seeing sick pets.  Your veterinarian can evaluate your pet and decide the appropriate steps for your pet\u2019s care.\n\nIf your pet is tested for COVID-19 and is confirmed to be infected\nDepending on how sick your pet is, your veterinarian may recommend that your pet be isolated at home, instead of staying in the hospital.  Some pets did not show any signs of illness, but those pets that did get sick all had mild disease that could be taken care of at home.\n\nIf your veterinarian recommends home isolation and you are able to care for your pet at home, follow this advice to protect yourself and others.\n\nWhat to do if your pet gets sick\nKeep your pet at home, except to get medical care\nTalk with your veterinarian regularly. Call before you take your pet to the veterinary clinic. Be sure to alert your veterinarian if your pet has trouble breathing, or if you think it is an emergency.\nWhile most pets appear to show only mild symptoms or no symptoms, we are still learning about how they are affected by the virus. Even if your pet appears to be feeling better, avoid the following activities until your veterinarian determines that it is safe for your pet to do so or your pet has met the guidance to end their isolation:\nVisits to veterinary hospitals, without calling the veterinarian first\nVisits to human healthcare facilities or schools\nVisits to parks (including dog parks), markets, or other gatherings such as festivals\nVisits to the groomer, including mobile grooming salons\nVisits to pet daycares or boarding facilities\nOther outings such as playdates, hikes, or visiting other homes, with or without pets\nUsing dog walkers or pet-sitters that live outside your home\nSeparate your pet from other people and pets in your home\nHave the pet stay in a designated \u201csick room\u201d (such as a laundry room or extra bathroom) if possible, or otherwise be separated from people and other animals. This is the same way a person with COVID-19 would separate from others in their household.\nAvoid contact with the pet as much as possible, including, petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food or bedding.\nIf possible, provide a separate litterbox or bathroom area from other pets.\nDOGS: If you have a private backyard where your dog can go to the bathroom, do not take them for walks. If you must walk your dog, limit it to bathroom breaks only, stay close to your home, and keep your pet at least 6 feet away from other pets and people. Do not let other people touch or interact with your dog.\n\nCATS: Cats should be kept inside. Do not allow cats that have tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 to roam outside.\n\nCLEANING UP: There is no evidence to suggest that waste from infected pets needs any additional disinfection. Wear gloves when cleaning up after your pet, and place fecal material or litterbox waste in a sealed bag before disposing. Always wash your hands with soap and water immediately after cleaning up after your pet.\n\nProvide bedding, bowls or containers, treats, and toys that are separate from those used by other people or animals in the household.\nDisinfect bowls, toys, and other animal care items with an EPA-registered disinfectantexternal icon and rinse thoroughly with clean water afterwards.\nSoft items like towels, blankets, and other bedding, can be safely laundered and reused. Dirty laundry that has been in contact with an ill animal can be washed with other items.\nMonitor your pet\u2019s symptoms\nIt is important to keep track of your pet\u2019s symptoms during home isolation. If you think your pet has new symptoms or is getting worse, call your veterinarian.\n\nPets sick with COVID-19 may have:\n\nFever\nCoughing\nDifficulty breathing or shortness of breath\nLethargy (unusual laziness or sluggish)\nSneezing\nRunny nose\nEye discharge\nVomiting\nDiarrhea\nFollow all care instructions from your veterinarian.  Your veterinarian may have you keep a written log of your pet\u2019s symptoms.\n\nIf your pet develops new symptoms or seems to be getting worse, including trouble breathing, you should call your veterinarian right away.  Your veterinarian may be able to advise you over the phone or may tell you to bring your pet to their clinic or go to another clinic that can better care for your pet.\n\nProtect yourself when caring for a sick pet\nFollow similar recommended precautions as for people caring for an infected person at home.\nIf you are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, another household member should care for the pet, if possible.\nPeople should wear a mask and gloves  in the same room or area as the sick pet.\nAnimals should not wear a mask. Do not try to put a mask on your pet.\nUse gloves when handling the pet\u2019s dishes, toys, or bedding and when picking up feces (poop). Throw out gloves and place waste material or litterbox waste in a sealed bag before throwing away in a trashcan lined with a trash bag. Always wash your hands with soap and water immediately after cleaning up after your pet.\nClean your hands regularly throughout the day.\nWash hands: Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds each  Make sure everyone in the home does the same, especially after touching the sick pet or handling their dishes, toys, or bedding.\nHand sanitizer: If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.  Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.\nDo not touch your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.\nClean and then disinfect:\nFollow cleaning and disinfecting recommendations found on CDC\u2019s Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Home\nDo not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other products, such as hand sanitizer, counter-cleaning wipes, or other industrial or surface cleaners. There is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people or other animals from the skin, fur, or hair of pets. Using chemical disinfectants on your pet could make them very sick or kill them. Talk to your veterinarian\u200b if you have questions about appropriate products for bathing or cleaning your pet.\nWhen it is safe for your pet to be around others: ending home isolation\nFollow your veterinarian\u2019s advice for when it is safe for your pet to be around other people and animals. Some pets may need follow-up testing to see if they are still positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Monitoring, isolation, and movement restrictions can end for positive pets if:\n\nThe animal has not shown clinical signs consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection for at least 72 hours without medical management;\nAND one of the following conditions:\n\nIt has been at least 14 days since their last positive test from a lab that uses a validated SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR diagnostic assay;\nOR\n\nAll sample types collected at follow-up are negative by a validated SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR diagnostic assay.",

Persons who are severely immunocompromised may require testing to determine when they can be around others. Talk to your healthcare provider for more information. If testing is available in your community, it may be recommended by your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider will let you know if you can resume being around other people based on the results of your testing.\n\nYour doctor may work with an infectious disease expert or your local health department to determine whether testing will be necessary before you can be around others.\n\nFor Anyone Who Has Been Around a Person with COVID-19\nAnyone who has had close contact with someone with COVID-19 should stay home for 14 days after their last exposure to that person.\n\nHowever, anyone who has had close contact with someone with COVID-19 and who:\n\ndeveloped COVID-19 illness within the previous 3 months and\nhas recovered and\nremains without COVID-19 symptoms (for example, cough, shortness of breath)\ndoes not need to stay home.\n\nFor Healthcare Professionals\nIf you are a healthcare professional who thinks or knows you had COVID-19, you should follow the same recommendations listed above for when you can resume being around others outside the workplace.

            "HeadLine": "Contact Tracing for COVID-19",
            "Text": "For COVID-19, a close contact is defined as any individual who was within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes starting from 2 days before illness onset (or, for asymptomatic patients, 2 days prior to positive specimen collection) until the time the patient is isolated.\n\nThe public health evaluation of close contacts to patients with laboratory-confirmed or probable COVID-19 may vary depending on the exposure setting. Contacts in special populations and/or congregate settings require additional considerations and may need handoff to a senior health department investigator or special team. Additional guidance on managing these contacts can be found in Outbreak Investigations.\n\nClose Contact Evaluation and Monitoring Priorities\nIn jurisdictions with testing capacity, symptomatic and asymptomatic close contacts to patients with confirmed and probable COVID-19 should be evaluated and monitored. For areas with insufficient testing support and/or limited public health resources, the following evaluation and monitoring hierarchy (Box 4) can be used to help guide prioritization. The hierarchy is based on the assumption that if close contacts listed in Priority 1 become infected, they could potentially expose many people, those at higher risk for severe disease, or critical infrastructure workers. If close contacts in Priority 2 become infected, they may be at higher risk for severe disease, so prompt notification, monitoring, and linkage to needed medical and support services is important.\n\nWhen prioritizing close contacts to evaluate and monitor, jurisdictions should be guided by the local characteristics of disease transmission, demographics, and public health and healthcare system capacity. Some states require mandatory testing for specific circumstances. Local decisions depend on local guidance and circumstances.\n\nBox 4. Close Contact Evaluation and Monitoring Hierarchy\nEVALUATE/MONITOR CLOSE CONTACTS WHO ARE:\n\nPRIORITY 1\n\nHospitalized patients\nHealthcare personnel (HCP)\nFirst responders (e.g., EMS, law enforcement, firefighters)\nIndividuals living, working or visiting acute care, skilled nursing, mental health, and long-term care facilities\nIndividuals living, working or visiting community congregate settings (e.g., correctional facilities, homeless shelters, educational institutions, mass gatherings, and workplaces including production plants)\nMember of a large household living in close quarters\nIndividuals who live in households with a higher risk individual or who provide care in a household with a higher risk individual (Note: Household members who likely had extensive contact with a patient with COVID-19 should constitute the highest risk close contacts.)\nPRIORITY 2\n\nCritical infrastructure workers*\nIndividuals 65 years of age and older\nIndividuals at higher risk for severe disease\nPregnant women\nPRIORITY 3\n\nIndividuals with symptoms who do not meet any of the above categories\nPRIORITY 4\n\nIndividuals without symptoms who do not meet any of the above categories\n*Consider moving to Priority 1 any critical infrastructure worker who works closely with other critical infrastructure workers and/or is in close contact with large numbers of people (e.g., transportation, food service).\n\nNote: Boxes 1-3 can be found under the \u201cInvestigating a COVID-19 Case\u201d section of the guidance.\n\nContact tracers use clear protocols to notify, interview, and advise close contacts to patients with confirmed or probable COVID-19. Jurisdictions can use the following steps and considerations as a framework when developing a protocol for the tracing of close contacts. Step 1: Rapid Notification of Exposure\nFor contacts in your health department\u2019s jurisdiction:\n\nA close contact to a patient with confirmed or probable COVID-19 should be notified of their exposure as soon as possible (within 24 hours of contact elicitation). The patient may elect to notify some or all of their close contacts before the contact tracer.\nThe identity of the patient or other identifying information will not be revealed, alluded to, or confirmed by the contact tracer, even if explicitly asked by a contact.\nContacts can be notified through different channels such as phone, text, email, or in-person (if appropriate) in the primary language of the individual. Special consideration should be given to ensure culturally and linguistically appropriate communications, if possible. The protocol should clearly outline the primary and secondary means of notifying a contact.\nProtocols should be in place to provide services to people who are deaf or who have hearing loss.\nDepending on the information elicited during the case investigation, locating information for the contact may be insufficient. Tips on additional resources that may be used to obtain missing locating information can be found in Appendix B. Every effort should be made to reach the contact remotely before attempting in-person communication.\nOperational Questions to Consider\n\nWho will conduct contact notification in your jurisdiction? (e.g., case investigators, other public health staff, volunteers, contracted staff)\nHow will you collaborate to transfer contact information from one jurisdiction to another to ensure notification of exposure for contacts outside of your jurisdiction?\nHow can your jurisdiction incorporate existing or new technology (e.g., mobile app) into a contact tracer\u2019s workflow to speed up contact notification?\nWhen is in-person notification needed? Contact tracers expected to perform in-person notification need appropriate training on infection prevention and control practices and must obtain any necessary PPE prior to conducting in-person activities.\nWill contact tracers be asked to notify a client\u2019s household contacts/known contacts, or will the client be asked to make these notifications?\nHow will notification of exposure be handled for minors?\nIf an entire household is exposed, will there be one point of contact for the household or separate contacts for every household member?\nHow will a contact tracer follow up with a contact if the client makes the notification?\nHow will you work with employers when many contacts are within a work setting?\nStep 2: Contact Interview\nEvery effort should be made to interview the close contact by telephone, text, or video conference instead of in-person. The interview should be conducted in the individual\u2019s primary language (through interpretation services, if necessary). For in-person interviews, guidance on recommended infection prevention and control practices at a home or non-home residential setting can be found on CDC\u2019s Evaluating PUIs Residential page.\nAppendix C includes critical data elements that can be incorporated into a jurisdiction\u2019s form used to interview contacts to assess symptoms, better characterize their underlying risk for infection, and assess home and social factors that could impact compliance with self-quarantine.\nNotification of Exposure \u2013 A Contact Tracer\u2019s Guide for COVID-19 focuses on communication strategies for contact interviews and provides suggested language for each topic area covered in an interview.\nOperational Questions to Consider\n\nIf a contact needs to be interviewed via an interpreter, how will those services be accessed?\nHow will your jurisdiction navigate confidentiality challenges when the calendar date of an exposure easily reveals who may have exposed a contact to COVID-19?\nWhat steps will be taken if a contact is unwilling or unable to be interviewed or cannot be located?\nTop of Page\nStep 2a: Quarantine/Isolation Instructions and Testing\nQuarantine/Isolation instructions\nClose contacts who were not diagnosed with COVID-19 within the last 90 days:\nThose with no symptoms will be asked to self-quarantine for 14 days from their last potential exposure and should be considered for testing. The last potential exposure would initially be determined by the case investigator. See Sample Quarantine Instructions for Close Contacts with No Symptoms\nThose with symptoms should immediately self-isolate for 10 days after symptom onset and be referred for testing and medical care. Negative test results for contacts do not change the length of quarantine. It is still 14 days.\nClose contacts who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by either (1) a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA within the last 90 days or (2) a healthcare provider based on their symptoms, and 90 days or less have passed since their symptoms began.\nThose with no current symptoms of COVID-19 do not have to quarantine, and retesting is not recommended.\nThose with symptoms, should begin self-isolation immediately for 10 days after symptom onset and consult with a medical provider to determine if they may have been re-infected with SARS-CoV-2 or if symptoms are caused by another etiology. Contacts with no primary healthcare provider will need to be connected to telemedicine (e.g., videoconference or phone consultation). Negative test results for contacts do not change the length of quarantine. It is still 14 days.\nAdvise contacts to cancel or postpone plans that involve social gatherings, vacations or other planned travel until cleared for these activities by public health authorities (based on the guidance above).\nLocal and state health departments may request federal public health travel restrictions, which prevent listed travelers from boarding commercial airplanes and trigger public health notification if they enter the United States by land or sea, to support state- or local-mandated quarantine or isolation for contacts.\nSupport with federal public health travel restrictions may be requested by public health partners by contacting the CDC quarantine station with jurisdiction for the area.\nIf needed, jurisdictions should refer clients for social support services (for example, food, childcare, housing, and other services) to help encourage clients to stay at home and comply with quarantine or isolation.\nIf contacts refuse to comply voluntarily with self-quarantine or self-isolation instructions, jurisdictions should consider what options (e.g., legal order for isolation) are available to them under relevant state or local legal authority.\nTesting Instructions\nIf resources permit, jurisdictions should arrange for all close contacts to be tested, as appropriate.\nRegarding test results by RT-PCR for SARS CoV-2 RNA for contacts with no previous COVID-19 infection in the past 90 days:\nIf test results are positive, close contacts will be referred to a case investigator.\nIf test results are negative:\nAsymptomatic close contacts should continue to self-quarantine for a full 14 days after last exposure and follow all recommendations of public health authorities.\nSymptomatic close contacts should continue to self-quarantine until symptom resolution as recommended by public health authorities. A second test and additional medical consultation may be needed if symptoms do not improve.\nIf testing is not available, symptomatic close contacts should be advised to self-isolate for 14 days and be managed as a probable case. Self-isolation is recommended for people with probable or confirmed COVID-19 who have mild illness and are able to recover at home.\nAll close contacts should be educated about COVID-19 symptoms to monitor for and be instructed to promptly report any new symptoms to public health authorities and seek medical care when necessary.\nSample Quarantine Instructions for Close Contacts with No Symptoms\nSelf-quarantine, preferably at home, until 14 days after the last potential exposure, maintain social distance (at least 6 feet) from others at all times, and follow all CDC guidance on self-quarantine.\nSelf-monitor daily for symptoms. [NOTE: Include instructions on how close contacts can report symptoms to the health department and agreed upon reporting times.]\nIf you have a thermometer, check and record your temperature twice a day. Thermometers should not be shared.\nContact a healthcare provider immediately if you:\nFeel feverish or have a temperature of 100.4\u2070F or higher.\nDevelop a cough or shortness of breath.\nHave persistent pain or pressure in your chest.\nDevelop new confusion.\nAre unable to wake up or stay awake.\nHave bluish lips or face.\nDevelop mild symptoms like sore throat, muscle aches, tiredness, or diarrhea.\nAvoid contact with people at higher risk for severe illness (unless they live in the same home and had the same exposure as you).\nFollow CDC guidance if you develop symptoms.\n\nOperational Questions to Consider\n\nUnder what circumstances will quarantine be mandatory (under public health orders) as opposed to voluntary?\nWho will be referred for testing (e.g., symptomatic, asymptomatic) and how (e.g., testing site, home test kit)?\nHow will contacts be checked against databases of already confirmed cases to ensure they are not already in self-isolation?\nWill contact tracers be collecting diagnostic respiratory specimens?\nHow will contacts be monitored for self-quarantine compliance?\nWhat services are available in the community to support workers who need to stay home and self-quarantine?\nHow can your jurisdiction incorporate technology, such as a mobile app or online tool, to assist with active monitoring of close contacts (e.g., symptom reporting, temperature checks)?\nCan your jurisdiction supply a letter/email to close contacts documenting their need to self-quarantine for a specified date range? Contacts could provide this to their employers to verify the reason for a work absence.\nTop of Page\nStep 2b: Assessing Self-Quarantine Support Needs\nEmphasis should be placed on helping contacts identify any need for social support during self-quarantine.\n\nSelf-quarantine of close contacts exposed to COVID-19 prevents transmission to others and is critical to the success of case investigation and contact tracing efforts. For most, self-quarantine can take place at home. If possible, contacts should be asked to voluntarily stay home, monitor themselves, and maintain social distance from others. The timeframe for self-quarantine is 14 days following the last day of exposure to a patient with COVID-19, to ensure that the contact does not get sick themselves and spread the virus to others. Adherence to self-quarantine instructions may depend on the support provided to contacts.\n\nSelf-quarantine requires that a contact remain in a specific room separate from other non-exposed people and pets in the home, and ideally with access to a separate bathroom. First and foremost, the contact tracer should assess an individual\u2019s ability to self-quarantine in a safe environment that provides access to a private room and bathroom, as well as access to adequate food and water among other considerations. For a portion of the US population, self-quarantine at home will be a challenge. It will be particularly difficult for some of the most vulnerable populations.\n\nConsiderations must also be made for close contacts who express fear of abuse or violence if they must self-quarantine at home. Additionally, some contacts (e.g., single parents, nursing mothers, parents with children and toddlers, and other primary caregivers) may face other challenges, such as childcare or dependent adult care, that may affect their ability to self-quarantine. Social services, housing and other supportive services will be needed for those contacts who are unable to separate themselves from others in their current living situation. See Support Services for further considerations.\n\nClose contacts will also need to be supported with health coaching to ensure daily monitoring of temperature and the onset of any COVID-19 symptoms and have access to clinical services should symptoms appear. Coordination of access to telehealth services may be needed for contacts without virtual access to a primary care provider. All close contacts entering a 14-day self-quarantine period should be provided a COVID-19 kit with the following resources*:\n\nWashable cloth face covering\nGloves\nDigital thermometer\nAlcohol-based hand sanitizer, soap, EPA-registered household disinfectantexternal icon\nCOVID-19 health education materials (translated into the appropriate language)\nInstructions for cleaning and disinfecting your home for those sharing space with others\nA hotline/warmline to address any support needs during the self-quarantine period, including medical support\n*The composition of the COVID-19 kit will depend on the jurisdiction\u2019s resources.\n\nOperational Questions to Consider\n\nAre there other resources that your jurisdiction can share to provide health advice and answer questions? (e.g., mobile app, hotline/call center, CDC Coronavirus Symptom Self-Checker, CDC-INFO)\nStep 3: Medical Monitoring\nContacts who agree to self-quarantine will ideally receive active daily monitoring through real-time communication methods (e.g., telephone calls, video conferencing) to check-in on their temperature and COVID-19 symptoms throughout the length of their self-quarantine.\nIf a jurisdiction\u2019s resources do not allow for active daily monitoring, contacts will be asked to self-monitor and communicate remotely (e.g., email, recorded video, telephone message, text, monitoring apps) to notify public health authorities of their health status and promptly communicate any new symptoms or symptoms of increasing severity. A daily temperature/symptom logpdf icon can be provided to the contact electronically to aid in self-monitoring.\nFor those individuals self-monitoring and sharing reports remotely, reports must be received by the agreed upon time each day, and protocol must address follow-up actions for contacts who do not report out.\nContacts who develop and report symptoms should be linked to clinical care and testing. For contacts who report testing, follow up to confirm results.\nIf positive, the contact will be referred to a case investigator.\nIf negative, symptomatic contacts should continue to self-quarantine and follow all recommendations of public health authorities. A second test and additional medical consultation may be needed if symptoms do not improve.\nIf testing is not available, symptomatic close contacts should be advised to self-isolate and be managed as a probable case. Self-isolation is recommended for people with probable or confirmed COVID-19 who have mild illness and are able to recover at home.\nOperational Questions to Consider\n\nWhat steps will be taken for contacts under self-monitoring who do not report as required? How intensive will the outreach be (e.g., same-day home visit)?\nStep 3a: Monitoring and Isolation Instructions\nClients with probable or confirmed COVID-19 should be advised to self-isolate immediately, if they are not doing so already. Self-isolation is recommended for people with probable or confirmed COVID-19 who have mild illness and are able to recover at home.\nIt should be made clear to the client whether the isolation instructions are voluntary or mandatory, as determined by state or local public health authorities.\nAdvise clients to cancel or postpone plans that involve social gatherings, vacations or other planned travel until cleared for these activities by public health authorities (based on the guidance above).\nLocal and state health departments may request federal public health travel restrictions, which prevent listed travelers from boarding commercial airplanes and trigger public health notification if they enter the United States by land or sea, to support state- or local-mandated isolation for infected individuals.\n\u200bSupport with federal public health travel restrictions may be requested by public health partners by contacting the CDC quarantine station with jurisdiction for the area.\nIf needed, jurisdictions should refer clients for social support services (for example, food, childcare, housing, and other services) to help encourage clients to stay at home and comply with isolation.\nIf clients refuse to comply voluntarily with self-isolation instructions, jurisdictions should consider what options (e.g., legal order for isolation) are available to them under relevant state or local legal authority.\nThe client should be informed of COVID-19 symptoms to monitor for and be instructed to get medical attention immediately if he/she experiences any emergency warning signs, such as trouble breathing. Clients with no primary healthcare provider will need linkage to telemedicine or phone consultation.\nThe client should also be informed of ways to prevent infection among those living in their household.\nAdditional self-isolation guidance should be reviewed with the client and instructional materials provided. Sample materials can be found on the CDC website:\n10 things you can do to manage your COVID-19 symptoms at home pdf iconpdf icon\nWhat to Do If You Are Sick\nWhen You Can be Around Others After You Had or Likely Had COVID-19\nAll instructions should be provided in a client\u2019s primary language.\nOperational Questions to Consider\n\nUnder what circumstances will isolation be mandatory (under public health orders) as opposed to voluntary? How will this distinction be made clear to a patient?\nHow will clients be monitored for isolation compliance?\nIn the event that self-isolation is not feasible, what alternative supports exist, and/or what risk-reduction measures can be taken?\nTop of Page\nStep 4: Contact Close Out\nContacts who remain asymptomatic for 14 days after last exposure can be notified of their release from monitoring and provided general health education in their primary language.\nContacts who develop symptoms but test negative during their monitoring period should continue to self-quarantine and follow all recommendations of public health authorities. A second test and additional medical consultation may be needed if symptoms do not improve. The decision to release a contact from self-quarantine should be determined at the local level and should be communicated clearly to the contact.\nOperational Questions to Consider\n\nWill the health department send an alert notification to the individual one day prior to the end of self-quarantine to double-check signs/symptoms and authorize return to work?\nWill a \u201creturn to work\u201d letter be available to contacts who request one after completing the monitoring period?\nWill a warmline be offered to address any post-monitoring issues?",

CDC is allowing crew members to disembark from all cruise ships in U.S. waters with certain precautions. Cruise lines with complete and accurate response plans will be able to use commercial travel to disembark crew members from certain ships if the ships meet certain criteria set by CDC including that there have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 or COVID-like illnesses on board the ship within the last 28 days. These ships are also able to lessen certain social distancing restrictions onboard. Cruise lines with complete and accurate response plans under the No Sail Order but not meeting the above criteria will still be able to disembark their crew members using non-commercial travel. Cruise lines must have measures in place to ensure those involved in transport are not exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19 and follow all CDC requirements to prevent interaction of disembarking crew with the public.\n\nCriteria for Commercial Transport of Crew\nLearn more about Cruise Ship Crew Member Disembarkations during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nShips that are requesting the use of commercial travel for disembarking crew members will need to meet the following criteria:\n\nA response plan under the No Sail Order that is complete and accurate\nThis does not mean ships are allowed to resume passenger travel, but rather that they have met CDC\u2019s requirements to provide a safe environment for crew members to work and to disembark crew safely by non-commercial travel.\nCruise company officials must sign an acknowledgment of the completeness and accuracy of their response plan.\nNo confirmed cases of COVID-19[1] or COVID-like illness[2] for 28 days, as determined by a qualified medical professional.\nIf the ship has received ship-to-ship transfers, the crew must have come from a ship that had no confirmed cases of COVID-19 or COVID-like illness within the 28 days before the transfer occurred.\nIf land-based crew embarked, they were immediately quarantined for 14 days upon embarking the ship.\nSubmission of a signed attestation for commercial travel.\nMeeting these criteria does not mean cruise ships can resume passenger operations. We don\u2019t have enough information at this time to say when it will be safe to resume sailing with passengers. Cruise lines may need to establish additional safety measures before sailing with passengers is permitted to resume. CDC will continue to evaluate and update its recommendations as the situation evolves.\n\nAll cruise ships operating in U.S. waters, or seeking to operate in U.S. waters, must comply with all of the  requirements under the No Sail Order and Interim Guidance During the Period of the No Sail Order for the entire period of the No Sail Order even when outside U.S. waters.\n\nAs ships become eligible to transport crew members commercially, this page will provide a list of cruise ships meeting those criteria.\n\nConfirmed COVID-19 means laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing\nCOVID-like illness means acute respiratory illness (ARI), influenza-like illness (ILI), or diagnosis of pneumonia.\nStatus of No Sail Order Response Plans and Commercial Transport of Crew\nAs a prerequisite for requesting commercial travel, cruise lines must have a complete and accurate response plan that provides a safe environment for crew members to work and disembark during the period of the No Sail Order. CDC has provided feedback regarding all the response plans that have been submitted and is working with the cruise lines to ensure they are implementing the safeguards outlined in their plans.\n\nThe following table lists cruise lines that have ships operating or planning to operate in U.S. waters during the period of the No Sail Order extension.\n\nDetermination for color-coding status (Green, Red, or Yellow) can only be made for ships if the following are true:\n\nCDC has finished the review of the cruise line\u2019s plan, and\nCruise line has returned an acknowledgement attesting that their No Sail Order response plan is complete and accurate.\nShips of cruise lines that have not met the above two criteria will be listed as Provisionally Green* or Provisionally Red^.\n\nThis table is updated once a week every Tuesday.

A cruise ship operator must be in compliance with the No Sail Order, the operator\u2019s No Sail Order response plan, and CDC\u2019s Interim Guidance for Mitigation of COVID-19 Among Cruise Ship Crew During the Period of the No Sail Order. CDC assesses compliance through implementation checks on a sample of ships covered under a cruise ship operator\u2019s plan. There must be no evidence of noncompliance.\n\nWhat steps is CDC taking to make sure ships stay in compliance with the criteria for commercial transport of crew?\nCDC will review weekly surveillance data provided by ships, and only those ships that continue to report no cases of COVID-19 or COVID-like illness will maintain this status.\n\nWhat other changes can cruise ships make if they meet these criteria?\nCDC is committed to helping cruise lines provide for the safety and well-being of their crew members onboard. As cruise ships are able to show they have no cases of confirmed COVID-19 or COVID-like illnesses on board, crew members will be able to resume some of their daily interactions with fellow crew members.\n\nSome examples of decreased restrictions on cruise ships if they meet these criteria include resuming in-person meetings, events, and social gatherings; reopening bars, gyms, or other group settings onboard for crew member use; and removing requirements to wear face coverings.\n\nWhat is the difference between the two attestations CDC requires under the No Sail Order?\nUnder the No Sail Order, cruise lines are required to develop and implement comprehensive plans to prevent, detect, respond to, and contain COVID-19 among crew members onboard. While these response plans have been under review, CDC has allowed cruise lines to disembark crew members if they submit a signed attestation stating they have complied with the requirements to safely disembark crew members. This attestation included a requirement that crew members only use noncommercial travel to disembark and reach their final destinations and do not interact with the public during travel.\n\nCruise lines that have a complete and accurate No Sail Order response plan may disembark crew members without a signed attestation if they use noncommercial travel and follow CDC requirements. Cruise company officials must sign an acknowledgment of the completeness and accuracy of their response plan. Cruise ships that want to use commercial travel for crew members must meet additional requirements, which include demonstrating there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 or COVID-like illness on board and submitting a signed attestation for commercial travel.\n\nWhat does it mean if a cruise line is not listed on the table above?\nIf a cruise line is not listed, it means the cruise line is not operating and does not plan to operate any of its ships in U.S. waters during the period of the No Sail Order.\n\nWhat does it mean if a cruise ship is not listed on the table above?\nIf a cruise ship is not listed, it means the ship is not operating in U.S. waters and does not plan to operate in U.S. waters during the period of the No Sail Order.",

            "Text": "Tracking data on COVID-19 during pregnancy can protect pregnant women and their babies.\nAn MMWR study suggests that pregnant women with COVID-19 are more likely to be hospitalized and are at increased risk for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and receipt of mechanical ventilation than nonpregnant women. Risk of death is similar for both groups. But much remains unknown.\n\nCDC is collaborating with state, local, and territorial health departments and external partners to better understand COVID-19 during pregnancy.

Pregnant women with COVID-19 who were hospitalized,* United States, [January 22-September 8, 2020]\nData were collected from 20,798 women, but hospitalization data were only available for 17,697 (85%). HOSPITALIZED CASES\n4,882\n*Data were not available to distinguish hospitalization for COVID-19\u2013related indications, such as worsening respiratory status, from hospital admission for pregnancy-related indications, such as delivery.\n\nPregnant women with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU, or who required mechanical ventilation, United States, [January 22-September 8, 2020]\nData were collected from 20,798 women, but ICU admission data were only available for 5,339 (25.7%) women, and mechanical ventilation data were only available for 4,674 (22.5%) women. About the Data\nThis page is updated weekly on Thursday at 1:00pm ET based on data collected by Tuesday at 12:30pm ET. The cases reported are only confirmed cases with laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nThere are currently 56 U.S.-affiliated jurisdictions reporting cases of COVID-19. This includes 50 states, District of Columbia, Guam, New York City, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S Virgin Islands.\n\nBecause only about a quarter of case report forms include information on pregnancy status, these numbers likely do not include all pregnant women with COVID-19 in the United States and must be interpreted with caution. The completeness of this variable continues to improve each week. Increases in the total number of cases of COVID-19 among pregnant women are largely due to the updating of pregnancy status among already reported cases. Case numbers reported on other websites may differ from what is posted on CDC\u2019s website because CDC\u2019s overall case numbers are validated through a confirmation process with each jurisdiction. Differences between reporting jurisdictions and CDC\u2019s website may occur because of the timing of reporting and website updates. The process used for finding and confirming cases displayed by other sites may differ. Case counts may fluctuate from week to week due to data quality and cleaning processes.",

            "Text": "Quarantine is used to keep someone who might have been exposed to COVID-19 away from others. Quarantine helps prevent spread of disease that can occur before a person knows they are sick or if they are infected with the virus without feeling symptoms. People in quarantine should stay home, separate themselves from others, monitor their health, and follow directions from their state or local health department.\n\nQuarantine or isolation: What's the difference?\n\nQuarantine keeps someone who might have been exposed to the virus away from others.\n\nIsolation keeps someone who is infected with the virus away from others, even in their home.\n\nWho needs to quarantine?\n\nPeople who have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19\u2014excluding people who have had COVID-19 within the past 3 months.\n\nPeople who have tested positive for COVID-19 do not need to quarantine or get tested again for up to 3 months as long as they do not develop symptoms again. People who develop symptoms again within 3 months of their first bout of COVID-19 may need to be tested again if there is no other cause identified for their symptoms.\n\nWhat counts as close contact?\n\nYou were within 6 feet of someone who has COVID-19 for a total of 15 minutes or more\nYou provided care at home to someone who is sick with COVID-19\nYou had direct physical contact with the person (hugged or kissed them)\nYou shared eating or drinking utensils\nThey sneezed, coughed, or somehow got respiratory droplets on you\nSteps to take\n\nStay home and monitor your health\n\nStay home for 14 days after your last contact with a person who has COVID-19\nWatch for fever (100.4\u25e6F), cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19\nIf possible, stay away from others, especially people who are at higher risk for getting very sick from COVID-19\nWhen to start and end quarantine\nYou should stay home for 14 days after your last contact with a person who has COVID-19.\n\nFor all of the following scenarios, even if you test negative for COVID-19 or feel healthy, you should stay home (quarantine) since symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus.\n\nSee scenarios below to determine when you can end quarantine and be around others.\n\nScenario 1: Close contact with someone who has COVID-19\u2014will not have further close contact\nI had close contact with someone who has COVID-19 and will not have further contact or interactions with the person while they are sick (e.g., co-worker, neighbor, or friend).\n\nYour last day of quarantine is 14 days from the date you had close contact.\n\nDate of last close contact with person who has COVID-19 + 14 days= end of quarantine Scenario 2: Close contact with someone who has COVID-19\u2014live with the person but can avoid further close contact\nI live with someone who has COVID-19 (e.g., roommate, partner, family member), and that person has isolated by staying in a separate bedroom. I have had no close contact with the person since they isolated.\n\nYour last day of quarantine is 14 days from when the person with COVID-19 began home isolation.\n\nDate person with COVID-19 began home isolation + 14 days = end of quarantine Scenario 3.

What if I ended up having close contact with the person who is sick during my quarantine? What if another household member gets sick with COVID-19? Do I need to restart my quarantine?\n\nYes. You will have to restart your quarantine from the last day you had close contact with anyone in your house who has COVID-19. Any time a new household member gets sick with COVID-19 and you had close contact, you will need to restart your quarantine.\n\nDate of additional close contact with person who has COVID-19 + 14 days = end of quarantine Scenario 4: Live with someone who has COVID-19 and cannot avoid continued close contact\nI live in a household where I cannot avoid close contact with the person who has COVID-19. I am providing direct care to the person who is sick, don\u2019t have a separate bedroom to isolate the person who is sick, or live in close quarters where I am unable to keep a physical distance of 6 feet.\n\nYou should avoid contact with others outside the home while the person is sick, and quarantine for 14 days after the person who has COVID-19 meets the criteria to end home isolation.\n\nDate the person with COVID-19 ends home isolation + 14 days = end of quarantine",

This strategy is consistent with the current phase of the pandemic and more effectively protects the health of the American public.\n\nBeginning September 14, 2020, the USG will remove requirements for directing all flights carrying airline passengers arriving from, or recently had a presence in, certain countries to land at one of 15 designated airports and halt enhanced entry health screening for these passengers. Currently, enhanced entry health screening is conducted for those arriving from, or with recent presence in, China (excluding the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau), Iran, the Schengen region of Europe, the United Kingdom (excluding overseas territories outside of Europe), Ireland, and Brazil.\n\nWe now have a better understanding of COVID-19 transmission that indicates symptom-based screening has limited effectiveness because people with COVID-19 may have no symptoms or fever at the time of screening, or only mild symptoms. Transmission of the virus may occur from passengers who have no symptoms or who have not yet developed symptoms of infection. Therefore, CDC is shifting its strategy and prioritizing other public health measures to reduce the risk of travel-related disease transmission.\n\nUSG resources will instead be dedicated to more effective mitigation efforts that focus on the individual passenger, including: pre-departure, in-flight, and post-arrival health education for passengers; robust illness response at airports; voluntary collection of contact information from passengers using electronic means as proposed by some airlines to avoid long lines, crowding and delays associated with manual data collection; potential testing to reduce the risk of travel-related transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 and movement of the virus from one location to another; country-specific risk assessments to assist passengers in making informed decisions about travel-related risk; enhancing training and education of partners in the transportation sector and at United States ports of entry to ensure recognition of illness and immediate notification to CDC; and post-arrival passenger recommendations for self-monitoring and precautions to protect others, with enhanced precautions, including staying home to the extent possible for 14 days for people arriving from high-risk destinations.\n\nBy refocusing our mitigation efforts on individual passenger risk throughout the air travel journey, the USG can most effectively protect the health of the American public.",

            "Text": "Document purpose: Markets are a critical place of commerce and a source of many essential goods, but they can pose potential risks for COVID-19. This document provides suggestions for mitigating COVID-19 transmission in markets in global low-resource settings and describes considerations associated with each mitigation measure. The proposals are presented in table format and are organized by mitigation practice (physical distancing, hand hygiene, cleaning and disinfection, and respiratory hygiene).\n\nDocument audience: This document is intended for use by any person, institution, or organization preparing for or responding to cases of COVID-19 in the community, and for those assisting those organizations (federal and local governments, CDC country offices, and others).\n\nWhat this document adds to previously published guidance: This document provides suggestions that can be considered by personnel in low-resource settings outside the U.S. and can be adapted to follow national or local guidelines, and to account for local context. Local populations can be engagedpdf iconexternal icon in the planning and decision-making process by identifying trusted stakeholders and community leaders to provide feedback on proposed mitigation measures before their implementation.\n\nLayered approach: Mitigation measures in markets can be organized into three categories: personal controls, administrative controls, and engineering controls. These should be layered on top of each other to reduce overall risk of COVID-19 for customers and vendors in markets.\n\nPersonal controls: Individual behaviors to protect themselves and those around them\nAdministrative controls: Processes and policies that keep people safe\nEngineering controls: Physical structures put in place to distance people from hazards\nPhysical Distancing\nPersonal controls: General recommendations for physical distancing in markets\nMaintain at least a 2-meter distance from others and practice no-contact greetings.\n\nCustomers can also try to stay home as much as possible by combining trips to the market.\n\nAdministrative and engineering controls: Possibilities for markets1\nSpace stalls a few (2+) meters apart, use every other stall, and/or extend the market area when possible so that customers and vendors stay as far apart from each other as possible.\nConsider limiting to one vendor per stall.\nFood vendors make items take-away only (not for eating on-site).\nMake aisles and entrances/exits go in one direction only (see diagrams below).\nSet up markers for where customers should stand at stalls and check-out stations (2+ meters from the vendor/cashier and from other customers) and where to stand in queues (see diagrams below).\nExtend operating times to help space out crowding.\nConsider separate days or times (such as when the market opens, before others arrive) for people who are elderly or who have serious underlying medical conditions.\nEncourage households to send a designated family member, rather than multiple family members, to buy food and supplies. The designated family member would ideally not be elderly or have serious underlying medical conditions.\nEncourage use of digital payment tools when feasible, such as mobile money. If digital payment tools are not feasible, consider advising vendors and customers to place cash and change on a counter or other surface rather than exchanging money hand to hand. Advise vendors to clean and disinfect the surface on a routine basis.\nControl the flow of people in and out of the market by closing off some entry and exit points.\nConsider decreasing the number of customers allowed in the market at the same time. This can be done by assigning people with certain last names to certain days or times of day or setting a limit on the number of people allowed inside at once.\nConsider advising only vendors to handle food and other goods, not customers.\nFor grocery stores/supermarkets, consider installing partitions or other physical barriers between customers and cashiers at check-out stations, if feasible.\nMaterials, activities, and personnel needed for implementation\nCommunication campaigns (via radio, newspaper, social media, WhatsApp, or other platforms) so that customers understand new procedures.\nSigns and/or audio messages in formats and languages suitable for local audiences within the market explaining procedures and rationale to customers and vendors.\nPaint, chalk, or other tools for marking where to stand and walk.\nMarket staff to explain and remind customers of physical distancing rules and to help control the number of people in the market.\nSupport from local authorities.\nConsiderations and challenges for implementation\nBecause these engineering and administrative controls require oversight in order to be implemented effectively, markets without clear management structures may have difficulty implementing them.\n\nThere will be a cost associated with the development of communication materials, markings for where to walk and stand, and possibly paying additional staff to monitor physical distancing.\n\nLimiting the number of people allowed in the market could be difficult to implement and could have negative impacts on households\u2019 access to food. Hand Hygiene\nPersonal controls: General recommendations for hand hygiene in markets\nClean hands frequently. Hand hygiene is a critical way that people can reduce the risk of COVID-19. In markets, customers and vendors should clean hands upon entry and exit, before and after each transaction, and after blowing their nose, sneezing, or coughing, in addition to other key times.image iconexternal icon\n\nTypes of hand hygiene:\nHandwashing with soap and water. Soap and water are available in most contexts and are effective against coronaviruses. The cleanest water available (ideally from an improved sourceexternal icona) should be used for handwashing, and all types of soap (bar soap, liquid soap, soapy water,b and powder soap) are effective at removing germs from hands, including the virus that causes COVID-19. Hands should be scrubbed with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and dried using single-use hand drying materials when available, or air dried.\n\nCleaning with alcohol-based hand rub. If hands are not visibly dirty, hand rub with at least 60% alcohol content can be used against coronaviruses as an alternative to cleaning hands when soap and water are not available. To use, rub hands together until they feel dry, or for approximately 20 seconds.\n\nIf soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub are unavailable or infeasible, handwashing with 0.05% chlorine solution can be considered as a temporary option. New chlorine solution should be made each day using the below instructions. Unused chlorine solution should be safely discarded at the end of each day in a latrine or toilet/drain connected to a septic system or sewer. Users should exercise caution to avoid getting the chlorine solution in their eyes or mouth.\n\nTo mix a chlorine handwashing solution using liquid bleach, use the percentage found on the bleach bottle (for example, 5%) and follow these instructions:\n\n[% chlorine in liquid bleach \u2215 % chlorine desired] \u2212 1 = Total parts of water for each part bleach\n\nExample of making 0.05% chlorine solution with 5% liquid bleach:\n\n[5% chlorine in liquid bleach / 0.05% chlorine desired] \u2013 1 = [5 / 0.05] \u2013 1\n\n= 99 parts of water for each 1 part liquid bleach\n\nIf you are using a 20 L container to mix the solution, you need 200 mL of liquid bleach and should fill the rest of the container with water.\n\n20 L / 100 parts = 0.2 L, or 200 mL per part aAn improved drinking water sourceexternal icon is a source that, by nature of its construction, adequately protects the source from outside contamination and may include piped household water connections, public standpipes, boreholes, protected dug wells, protected springs, and rainwater.\n\nb\u201cSoapy water\u201d is a mix of water and either powdered soap (such as laundry powder or detergent) or liquid soap. To prepare, mix enough soap with water so that you can create a lather when rubbing hands together. You can use soapy water like liquid soap, being sure that there is plain water for rinsing. As detailed above, the cleanest water available should be used for soapy water and rinse water. Instructions for making soapy water can be found in this documentexternal icon.\n\nAdministrative and engineering controls: Possibilities for markets\nEnsure widespread access to hand hygiene facilities by placing hand hygiene stations (handwashing stations or alcohol-based hand rub dispensers) at entrances, exits, and throughout the market, including within 5 meters of toilets if any are present at the market. Hand hygiene can be made obligatory upon entry and exit of the market. Hand hygiene stations should be obviously placed so that they are hard to avoid. Vendors and customers should have easy access to handwashing facilities (ideally one per vendor or group of vendors, depending on the layout).\nIn particular, handwashing stations should: 1) Allow users to scrub their hands under a stream of running water; 2) Secure provided soap (either a cage, rope, or other device); 3) Have a place to catch used water; 4) Provide single-use hand drying materials whenever possible; 5) Provide a waste bin to collect single-use hand drying materials (when applicable). More information on different handwashing station designs is available hereexternal icon.\nThe installation, supervision, and regular refilling should be the responsibility of local public health authorities but can be delegated to building / market managers.2\nIf using 0.05% chlorine solution, provide those doing the mixing with personal protective equipment (rubber gloves, thick aprons, and closed shoes, as well as masks and eye protection, if available).\nMaterials, activities, and personnel needed for implementation\nHandwashing stations or alcohol-based hand rub dispensers.\nDaily access to water (or alcohol-based hand rub) to refill hand hygiene stations and a consistent supply of soap.\nMarket staff to check on hand hygiene stations regularly and refill when necessary.\nMarket staff to enforce hand hygiene practice upon entry and exit to the market.\nSigns and/or audio messages in formats and languages suitable for local audiences within the market prompting customers to practice hand hygiene. Messaging should include information about when to practice hand hygiene as well as how.\nPersonal protective equipment (rubber gloves, thick aprons, and closed shoes) if using 0.05% chlorine solution.\nLocked location for storing handwashing stations or alcohol-based hand rub dispensers overnight.\nConsiderations and challenges for implementation\nContinuous oversight will be required to ensure that hand hygiene stations are refilled regularly, which may be difficult without clear management structures.\n\nIf water supply is not available on site, it will be more challenging and costly to regularly refill handwashing stations.\n\nThere will be costs associated with purchasing the handwashing stations or alcohol-based hand rub dispensers, refilling water and soap (or rub), personal protective equipment (if needed), developing and printing communications materials, and possibly paying staff to refill and reinforce use of hand hygiene stations upon entry and exit.\n\nThere could be supply chain constraints on soap and alcohol-based hand rub if demand increases as COVID-19 spreads. Single-use hand drying materials (such as paper towels) are often unavailable.\n\nIf using 0.05% chlorine solution, those mixing the solution should be adequately protected by wearing rubber gloves, thick aprons, and closed shoes during the mixing process because of potential skin, eye, and inhalation hazards. They should also be trained on how to mix chlorine solution.\n\nIf no rubber gloves are available, other non-permeable gloves can be substituted. Those mixing should remove gloves and wash hands immediately after mixing. If no aprons are available, cleaning personnel can wear protective clothing (such as long pants and long-sleeved shirts) and launder after use. Cleaning and Disinfection\nPersonal controls: General recommendations for cleaning and disinfection in markets\nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces at least once a day.3 In many market settings, the only surfaces that customers touch include the items that they are purchasing, cash, and any shared utensils, cups, or plates for food and beverages sold in markets. It is also possible that surfaces that are porous and therefore difficult to disinfect, such as wood tables, are touched frequently, but this will be different in every market and will need to be left up to the market administrator to assess. Railings, door handles, shopping carts, and sanitation (restroom/toilet/latrine) surfaces are other examples of frequently touched surfaces.\n\nCleaning refers to the removal of germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. It does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection. Removing dirt and impurities also helps disinfectant be more effective.\n\nDisinfecting refers to using chemicals, for example, sodium hypochlorite (bleach), to kill germs on surfaces. This process does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs, but by killing germs on a surface after cleaning, it can further lower the risk of spreading infection.\n\nIn market settings, use a 0.1% chlorine solution made from bleach, Calcium Hypochlorite (HTH), or bleaching powder and water (using non-turbid water source) for disinfection. Instructions for using HTH powder or bleaching powder can be found here.\n\nTo mix a chlorine solution using liquid bleach, use the percentage found on the bleach bottle (for example, 5%) and follow these instructions:4\n\n[% chlorine in liquid bleach \u2215 % chlorine desired] \u2212 1 = Total parts of water for each part bleach\n\nExample of making 0.1% chlorine solution with 5% liquid bleach:\n\n[5% chlorine in liquid bleach / 0.1% chlorine desired] \u2013 1 = [5 / 0.1] \u2013 1\n\n= 49 parts of water for each 1 part liquid bleach (50 parts total)\n\nIf you are using a 20 L jerry can to mix the solution, you need 400 mL of liquid bleach and should fill the rest of the jerry can with water.\n\n20 L / 50 parts = 0.4 L or 400 mL per part\n\nFurther instructions are available herepdf icon.\n\nCleaning and disinfection procedures:4\nPut on personal protective equipment (rubber gloves, thick aprons, and closed shoes, as well as masks and eye protection if available).\nMix 0.1% chlorine solution using the procedures described above in well-ventilated area.\nClean with detergent or soap and water to remove organic matter.\nApply the 0.1% chlorine solution to the surface with a cloth and allow for a contact time (the amount of time that the disinfectant should remain wet and undisturbed on the surface) of at least 1 minute. Additional disinfectant may need to be applied to ensure it remains wet for 1 minute. After 1 minute has passed, rinse residue with clean water (this will also protect the surface or item from damage).\nAfter cleaning and disinfection, carefully remove personal protective equipment (PPE) and wash hands immediately. Re-usable PPE (e.g. aprons) should be laundered immediately.\nCleaning and disinfecting should not take place near children or people with asthma.\n\nProcedures for various surfaces (hard surfaces, soft surfaces, electronics, and laundry) can be found here.\n\nAdministrative and engineering controls: Possibilities for markets\nMarket administrators should designate set \u2018cleaning personnel\u2019 (chosen vendors, cleaning staff, or other staff) to carry out cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces once a day, or more frequently if possible. This can take place either before the market opens or after it closes, whichever makes the most sense based on the context.\nMarket administrators and designated cleaning personnel should walk through the market together and decide which surfaces are touched frequently by customers and vendors and therefore should be the target of cleaning and disinfection efforts.\nProvide the market\u2019s designated cleaning personnel with cleaning supplies (soap/detergent, bleach, buckets) and personal protective equipment (PPE) to wear when mixing, cleaning, and disinfecting (rubber gloves, thick aprons, and closed shoes). PPE used for cleaning and disinfecting the market should be stored at the market in a secure, designated area. Cleaning personnel should not bring the PPE home.\nProvide those who typically clean (vendors, cleaning personnel, or other staff) with information (e.g. written or pictorial instructions) about when and how to clean and disinfect and how to safely prepare disinfectant solutions, as described in the leftmost column.\nMaterials, activities, and personnel needed for implementation\nStocks of soap, bleach, buckets, and other cleaning supplies (e.g. mops, rags).\nPersonal protective equipment for designated cleaning personnel (rubber gloves, thick aprons, safety glasses/face shields if available, and closed shoes).\nSufficient access to non-turbid water to meet all cleaning and disinfection needs.\nCommunications materials describing the cleaning and disinfection process, including proper mixing of solutions, for use by designated cleaning personnel.\nConsiderations and challenges for implementation\nThere will be costs associated with purchasing the bleach, soap, cleaning supplies, and personal protective equipment; printing communications materials; and possibly having to pay additional staff to clean.\n\nIf no rubber gloves are available for cleaning personnel, other non-permeable gloves can be used. If no aprons are available, cleaning personnel can wear protective clothing (such as long pants and long-sleeved shirts) and launder after use.\n\nThere could be further supply chain constraints on soap and chlorine products and PPE as demand increases as COVID-19 spreads.\n\nIf water supply is not available on site, it will be more challenging and costly to clean and disinfect daily.\n\nThere is potential for harm to users when using disinfection products, so it is important for cleaning personnel to be adequately protected in the mixing and disinfection process and trained on how to mix and disinfect.\n\nNote: Large-scale spraying of disinfectant in public places, including markets, is not recommended. There is limited evidence that it is effective. To be effective, disinfectants need to have sufficient contact time and coverage, which is difficult to get when doing large-scale spraying. There is also limited ability to control spray-related inhalation hazards by nearby people. Additionally, organic matter such as dirt or trash would need to be picked up/removed before disinfectants would work.4 Respiratory Hygiene\nPersonal controls: General recommendations for respiratory hygiene in markets\nIndividuals should cover coughs and sneezespdf icon with their elbow or a disposable tissue and clean hands immediately.\n\nIn areas where there is any level of known community transmission, all individuals, including those who lack symptoms, should wear masks when in public settings where other physical distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Individuals should wear masks correctly and make sure they are made from appropriate materialsexternal icon. Masks should not be worn by some individuals with physical, mental, emotional or behavioral issues, children under 2 years, or anyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious or incapacitated.\n\nAdministrative and engineering controls: Possibilities for markets\nMarket administrators can make it compulsory for vendors and customers to wear masks while at the market, aside from those individuals who should not wear masks.\nUse of masks can be enforced by the market staff member who is making sure customers practice hand hygiene and informing them about physical distancing measures.\nIn closed markets, open doors and windows as much as possible to increase air flow. If available, fans can help increase air flow. However, steps should be taken to minimize fans blowing from one person directly to another person to reduce the potential spread of respiratory droplets or aerosols.\nMaterials, activities, and personnel needed for implementation\nSigns and/or audio messages in formats and languages suitable for local audiences within the market to remind people to wear masks, explain why they are wearing masks (to protect others), and remind them to cover their coughs and sneezes.\nCommunication campaigns (via radio, newspaper, social media, WhatsApp, or other platforms) so that customers and vendors are aware of the new procedures and know to bring masks with them when they go to the market.\nConsiderations and challenges for implementation\nThis is a relatively low-cost measure and should be straightforward to implement, especially if masks are encouraged for use in other public settings, but there will still be costs associated with developing and printing communications materials.",

However, if hands are visibly dirty, always wash hands with soap and water. HVAC, ventilation, and filtration\nVentilation and filtration provided by heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems can reduce the airborne concentration of the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), which can reduce the risk of transmission through the air.\n\nCheck to be sure your HVAC filter is correctly in place and consider upgrading the filter to the highest-rated filter that your system can accommodate (consult your HVAC manual or an HVAC professional for details).\nHVAC systems only filter the air when the fan is running, so run the system fan for longer times, or continuously.  Many systems can be set to run the fan even when no heating or cooling is taking place.\nWhen used properly, air purifiers can help reduce airborne contaminants, including viruses, in a home or confined space.\nImprove ventilation with outside air to improve indoor air quality:\nOpen the windows, or screened doors, if possible.\nOperate a window air conditioner that has an outdoor air intake or vent, with the vent open.\nOpen the outside air intake of the HVAC system, if yours has one (this is not common).\nOperate a bathroom fan when the bathroom is in use or continuously, if possible.\nAvoid these actions when outdoor air pollution is high or when it makes your home too cold, hot, or humid.\nCare should be taken with portable ventilation equipment, for example, fans, to minimize air blowing from one person directly at another person to reduce the potential spread of any airborne or aerosolized viruses.\nRunning your HVAC system, using an air purifier or a portable air cleaner, and increasing ventilation are not enough to protect yourself and your family from COVID-19. Continue to follow other prevention guidelines.\nUse of ozone generators in occupied spaces is not recommended. When used at concentrations that do not exceed public health standards, ozone applied to indoor air does not effectively remove viruses, bacteria, mold, or other biological pollutants.\nWhen someone is sick Bedroom and bathroom  Keep separate bedroom and bathroom for a person who is sick (if possible).\n\nThe person who is sick should stay separated from other people in the home (as much as possible).\nIf you have a separate bedroom and bathroom: Wear disposable gloves and only clean the area around the person who is sick when needed, such as when the area is soiled. This will help limit your contact with the person who is sick.\nCaregivers can provide personal cleaning supplies to the person who is sick (if appropriate). Supplies include tissues, paper towels, cleaners, and EPA-registered disinfectantsexternal icon. If they feel up to it, the person who is sick can clean their own space.\nIf shared bathroom: The person who is sick should clean and disinfect after each use. If this is not possible, the caregiver should wait as long as possible before cleaning and disinfecting.\nSee precautions for household members and caregivers for more information.\nFood\nStay separated: The person who is sick should eat (or be fed) in their room if possible.\nWash dishes and utensils using disposable gloves and hot water: Handle any used dishes, cups/glasses, or silverware with gloves. Wash them with soap and hot water or in a dishwasher.\nClean hands after taking off gloves or handling used items.\nTrash Dedicated, lined trash can: If possible, dedicate a lined trash can for the person who is sick. Use disposable gloves when removing garbage bags, and handling and disposing of trash. Wash hands afterwards.",

Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.\n\nYou can get COVID-19 during your travels. You may feel well and not have any symptoms, but you can still spread COVID-19 to others. You and your travel companions (including children) may spread COVID-19 to other people including your family, friends, and community for 14 days after you were exposed to the virus.\n\nDon\u2019t travel if you are sick or if you have been around someone with COVID-19 in the past 14 days. Don\u2019t travel with someone who is sick.\n\nBefore You Travel\nBefore you travel, consider the following:\n\nIs COVID-19 spreading at your destination?\nThe more cases at your destination, the more likely you are to get infected during travel and spread the virus to others when you return.\nCheck Each State\u2019s Cases in the Last 7 Days\nTravel Recommendations for Destinations Around the World\nDo you live with someone who might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19?\nIf you get infected while traveling, you can spread the virus to loved ones when you return, even if you don\u2019t have symptoms.\nAre you at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19?\nAnyone can get very ill from the virus that causes COVID-19, but older adults and people of any age with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.\nDoes your destination have requirements or restrictions for travelers?\nSome state, local, and territorial governments have requirements, such as requiring people to wear masks and requiring those who recently traveled to stay home for up to 14 days. Check state, territorial, tribal and local public health websites for information before you travel. If you are traveling internationally, check the destination\u2019s Office of Foreign Affairs or Ministry of Health or the US Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Country Information pageexternal icon for details about entry requirements and restrictions for arriving travelers, such as mandatory testing or quarantine.\nIf You Travel\nDuring your trip, take steps to protect yourself and others from COVID-19:\n\nWear a mask to keep your nose and mouth covered when in public settings.\nAvoid close contact by staying at least 6 feet apart (about 2 arms\u2019 length) from anyone who is not from your household.\nWash your hands often or use hand sanitizer (with at least 60% alcohol).\nAvoid contact with anyone who is sick.\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.\nTraveling Abroad? Check CDC\u2019s COVID-19 Travel Recommendations by Destination before planning your trip.\n\nConsiderations for Types of Travel\nTravel increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19. Your chances of getting COVID-19 while traveling also depend on whether you and those around you take steps to protect yourself and others, such as wearing masks and staying 6 feet away from people outside your household (social distancing). Airports, bus stations, train stations, and rest stops are all places travelers can be exposed to the virus in the air and on surfaces. These are also places where it can be hard to social distance. In general, the longer you are around a person with COVID-19, the more likely you are to get infected.\n\nAir travel\n\nAir travel requires spending time in security lines and airport terminals, which can bring you in close contact with other people and frequently touched surfaces. Most viruses and other germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes. However, social distancing is difficult on crowded flights, and sitting within 6 feet of others, sometimes for hours, may increase your risk of getting COVID-19.\n\nAlso consider how you get to and from the airport, as public transportation and ridesharing can increase your chances of being exposed to the virus.\n\nBus or train travel\n\nTraveling on buses and trains for any length of time can involve sitting or standing within 6 feet of others, which may increase your risk of getting COVID-19. If you choose to travel by bus or train, learn what you can do to protect yourself on public transportation.\n\nCar travel\n\nMaking stops along the way for gas, food, or bathroom breaks can put you and your traveling companions in close contact with other people and frequently-touched surfaces.\n\nRV travel\n\nYou may have to stop less often for food or bathroom breaks, but RV travel usually means staying at RV parks overnight and getting gas and supplies at other public places. These stops may put you and those with you in the RV in close contact with others.\n\nLearn more about how to protect yourself from COVID-19 on different types of transportation\n\nKnow When to Delay your Travel to Avoid Spreading COVID-19\nPeople who are sick, have recently tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, or have been exposed to a person with COVID-19 should delay travel. Learn when and for how long to delay travel to avoid spreading COVID-19.\n\nHow Are Companies Protecting Customers from COVID-19?\nWhen planning travel, you may want to check companies\u2019 websites to see what they are doing to protect customers from COVID-19. Things to look for include:\n\nRequiring people to wear a mask\nPromoting social distancing\nUsing online or contactless reservations and check-in\nUsing contactless payment\nEnhanced cleaning procedures\nTips to avoid getting and spreading COVID-19 in common travel situations:\nIn public:\nWear a mask in public settings.\nStay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms\u2019 length) from anyone who is not from your household.\nBathrooms and rest stops:\nWash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after using the bathroom and after you have been in a public place.\nIf soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.\nGetting gas:\nUse disinfecting wipes on handles and buttons at the gas pumps before you touch them (if available).\nAfter fueling, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. When you get to your destination, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\nHotels and accommodations:\nSee advice for traveling overnight.\nFood stops:\nThe safest option is to bring your own food. If you don\u2019t bring your own food, use drive-through, delivery, take-out, and curb-side pick-up options.\nAnticipate Your Travel Needs\nBring a mask to wear in public places.\nPack hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Keep this within reach.\nBring enough of your medicine to last you for the entire trip.\nPack food and water in case restaurants and stores are closed, or if drive-through, take-out, and outdoor-dining options aren\u2019t available.\nIf you are considering cleaning your travel lodgings, see CDC\u2019s guidance on how to clean and disinfect.\nCheck Travel Restrictions\nState, local, and territorial governments may have travel restrictions in place, including testing requirements, stay-at-home orders, and quarantine requirements upon arrival. Follow state, local, and territorial travel restrictions. For up-to-date information and travel guidance, check the state, territorial, tribal and local health department where you are, along your route, and where you are going. Prepare to be flexible during your trip as restrictions and policies may change during your travel.\n\nIf traveling internationally or across international borders, check with the destination\u2019s Office of Foreign Affairs or Ministry of Health or the US Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Country Information pageexternal icon for details about entry requirements and restrictions for arriving travelers, such as mandatory testing or quarantine. Local policies at your destination may require you to be tested for COVID-19 before you are allowed to enter the country. If you test positive on arrival, you may be required to isolate for a period of time. You may even be prevented from returning to the United States, as scheduled.\n\nAfter You Travel\nYou may have been exposed to COVID-19 on your travels. You may feel well and not have any symptoms, but you can be contagious without symptoms and spread the virus to others. You and your travel companions (including children) pose a risk to your family, friends, and community for 14 days after you were exposed to the virus. Regardless of where you traveled or what you did during your trip, take these actions to protect others from getting sick after you return:\n\nWhen around others, stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms\u2019 length) from other people who are not from your household. It is important to do this everywhere, both indoors and outdoors.\nWear a mask to keep your nose and mouth covered when you are outside of your home.\nWash your hands often or use hand sanitizer (with at least 60% alcohol).\nWatch your health and look for symptoms of COVID-19. Take your temperature if you feel sick.\nFollow state, territorial, tribal and local recommendations or requirements after travel.\n\nHigher Risk Activities\nSome types of travel and activities can put you at higher risk for exposure to COVID-19 (see list below).  If you participated in higher risk activities or think that you may have been exposed before or during your trip, take extra precautions (in addition the ones listed above) to protect others for 14 days after you arrive:\n\nStay home as much as possible.\nAvoid being around people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.\nConsider getting tested for COVID-19.\nWhat activities are considered higher risk?\n\nHere are examples of activities and situations that can increase your risk of exposure to COVID-19:\n\nBeing in an area that is experiencing high levels of COVID-19, including destinations with a Level 3 Travel Health Notice. You can check the Travel Health Notices for recommendations for places you have traveled, including foreign countries and U.S. territories.  You can also check states, counties, and cities to determine if these areas are experiencing high levels of COVID-19.\nGoing to a large social gathering like a wedding, funeral, or party.\nAttending a mass gathering like a sporting event, concert, or parade.\nBeing in crowds \u2014 for example, in restaurants, bars, airports, bus and train stations, or movie theaters.\nTraveling on a cruise ship or river boat.",

            "Text": "As restaurants and bars resume operations in some areas of the United States, CDC offers the following considerations for ways in which operators can protect employees, customers, and communities and slow the spread of COVID-19. Restaurants and bars can determine, in collaboration with state and local health officials, whether and how to implement these considerations, making adjustments to meet the needs and circumstances of the local community. Implementation should be guided by what is feasible, practical, acceptable, and tailored to the needs of each community. These considerations are meant to supplement\u2014not replace\u2014any state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which businesses must comply.\n\nGuiding Principles to Keep in Mind\nThe more an individual interacts with others, and the longer that interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread. The risk of COVID-19 spread increases in a restaurant or bar setting as follows:\n\nLowest Risk: Food service limited to drive-through, delivery, take-out, and curb-side pick up.\nMore Risk: Drive-through, delivery, take-out, and curb-side pick up emphasized. On-site dining limited to outdoor seating. Seating capacity reduced to allow tables to be spaced at least 6 feet apart.\nEven More Risk: On-site dining with both indoor and outdoor seating. Seating capacity reduced to allow tables to be spaced at least 6 feet apart.\nHighest Risk: On-site dining with both indoor and outdoor seating. Seating capacity not reduced and tables not spaced at least 6 feet apart.\nCOVID-19 is mostly spread by respiratory droplets released when people talk, cough, or sneeze. It is thought that the virus may spread to hands from a contaminated surface and then to the nose or mouth, causing infection. Therefore, personal prevention practices (such as handwashing, staying home when sick) and environmental cleaning and disinfection are important principles that are covered in this document. Fortunately, there are a number of actions operators of restaurants and bars can take to help lower the risk of COVID-19 exposure and spread.\n\nPromoting Behaviors that Reduce Spread\nRestaurants and bars may consider implementing several strategies to encourage behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19 among employees and customers.\n\nStaying Home when Appropriate\nEducate employees about when they should stay home and when they can return to work.\nActively encourage employees who are sick or have recently had a close contact with a person with COVID-19 to stay home. Develop policies that encourage sick employees to stay at home without fear of reprisal, and ensure employees are aware of these policies.\nEmployees should stay home if they have tested positive for or are showing COVID-19 symptoms.\nEmployees who have recently had a close contact with a person with COVID-19 should also stay home and monitor their health.\nCDC\u2019s criteria can help inform when employees they may return to work:\nIf they have been sick with COVID-19\nIf they have recently had a close contact with a person with COVID-19\nHand Hygiene and Respiratory Etiquette\nRequire frequent employee handwashing (e.g. before, during, and after preparing food; after touching garbage) with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and increase monitoring to ensure adherence.\nIn addition to any state or local requirements regarding glove use in restaurant operations, glove use is only recommended when removing garbage bags or handling and disposing of trash and when handling used or dirty food service items.\nEmployees should always wash their hands after removing gloves.\nEncourage employees to cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Used tissues should be thrown in the trash and hands washed immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\nIf soap and water are not readily available, use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.\nCloth Face Coverings\nRequire the use of cloth face coverings among all staff, as feasible. Face coverings are most essential in times when physical distancing is difficult. Information should be provided to staff on proper use, removal, and washing of cloth face coverings.\nNote: Cloth face coverings should not be placed on:\nBabies and children younger than 2 years old\nAnyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious\nAnyone who is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the cloth face covering without assistance\nCloth face coverings are meant to protect other people in case the wearer is unknowingly infected but does not have symptoms. Cloth face coverings are not surgical masks, respirators, or personal protective equipment.\nAdequate Supplies\nEnsure adequate supplies to support healthy hygiene behaviors. Supplies include soap, hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol (placed on every table, if supplies allow), paper towels, tissues, disinfectant wipes, cloth face coverings (as feasible), and no-touch/foot pedal trash cans.\nSigns and Messages\nPost signs in highly visible locations (e.g., at entrances, in restrooms) that promote everyday protective measurespdf iconpdf icon and describe how to stop the spreadpdf iconpdf icon of germs such as by properly washing hands and properly wearing a cloth face coveringimage iconimage icon.\nInclude messages (for example, videos) about behaviors that prevent spread of COVID-19 when communicating with vendors, staff, and customers (such as on business websites, in emails,  and on social media accounts).\nFind free CDC print and digital resources at the bars and restaurant page, as well as on CDC\u2019s communications resources main page.\nMaintaining Healthy Environments\nRestaurants and bars may consider several implementing strategies to maintain healthy environments.\n\nCleaning and Disinfection\nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (e.g., door handles, cash registers, workstations, sink handles, bathroom stalls) at least daily, or as much as possible and as required by food safety requirements. Clean shared objects (e.g., payment terminals, tables, countertops/bars, receipt trays, condiment holders) between each use.\nContinue to follow all required safety laws, regulations, and rules.\nUse products that meet EPA disinfection criteriaexternal icon and that are appropriate for the surface. Allow the disinfectant to remain on the surface for the contact time recommended by the manufacturer.\nEstablish a disinfection routine and train staff on proper cleaning timing and procedures to ensure safe and correct application of disinfectants.\nWash, rinse, and sanitize food contact surfaces with an EPA-approved food contact surface sanitizer. If a food-contact surface must be disinfected for a specific reason, such as a blood or bodily fluid cleanup or deep clean in the event of likely contamination with SARS-CoV-2, use the following procedure: wash, rinse, disinfectant according to the label instructions for the disinfectant, rinse, then sanitize with a food-contact surface sanitizer.\nEnsure that cleaning or disinfecting product residues are not left on table surfaces. Residues could cause allergic reactions or cause someone to ingest the chemicals.\nDevelop a schedule for increased, routine cleaning and disinfection.\nEnsure safe and correct use and storage of disinfectants to avoid food contamination and harm to employees and other individuals. This includes storing products securely away from children.\nUse gloves when removing garbage bags or handling and disposing of trash. Wash hands after removing gloves.\nShared Objects\nDiscourage sharing of items that are difficult to clean, sanitize, or disinfect.\nLimit any sharing of food, tools, equipment, or supplies by staff members.\nEnsure adequate supplies to minimize sharing of high-touch materials (e.g., serving spoons) to the extent possible; otherwise, limit use of supplies and equipment by one group of workers at a time and clean and disinfect between use.\nAvoid using or sharing items that are reusable, such as menus, condiments, and any other food containers. Instead, use disposable or digital menus, single serving condiments, and no-touch trash cans and doors.\nUse touchless payment options as much as possible, if available. Ask customers and employees to exchange cash or card payments by placing on a receipt tray or on the counter rather than by hand to avoid direct hand to hand contact. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as pens, counters, or hard surfaces between use and encourage patrons to use their own pens.\nUse disposable food service items (e.g., utensils, dishes, napkins, tablecloths). If disposable items are not feasible or desirable, ensure that all non-disposable food service items are handled with gloves and washed with dish soap and hot water, or in a dishwasher. Change and launder linen items (e.g., napkins and tablecloths) after each customer or party\u2019s use. Employees should wash their hands after removing their gloves or after handling used food service items.\nAvoid use of food and beverage utensils and containers brought in by customers.\nVentilation\nEnsure that ventilation systems operate properly and increase circulation of outdoor air as much as possible, for example by opening windows and doors and prioritizing outdoor seating. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk to customers or employees (e.g., risk of falling or triggering asthma symptoms).\nWater Systems\nTo minimize the risk of Legionnaires\u2019 disease and other diseases associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (e.g., sink faucets, decorative fountains, drinking fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown.\nModified Layouts and Procedures\nChange restaurant and bar layouts to ensure that all customer parties remain at least 6 feet apart (e.g., marking tables/stools that are not for use).\nLimit seating capacity to allow for social distancing.\nOffer drive-through, curbside take out, or delivery options as applicable. Prioritize outdoor seating as much as possible.\nAsk customers to wait in their cars or away from the establishment while waiting to pick up food or when waiting to be seated. Inform customers of food pickup and dining protocols on the business\u2019 website and on posted signs.\nDiscourage crowded waiting areas by using phone app, text technology, or signs to alert patrons when their table is ready. Avoid using \u201cbuzzers\u201d or other shared objects.\nConsider options for dine-in customers to order ahead of time to limit the amount of time spent in the establishment.\nAvoid offering any self-serve food or drink options, such as buffets, salad bars, and drink stations.\nPhysical Barriers and Guides\nInstall physical barriers, such as sneeze guards and partitions, particularly in areas where it is difficult for individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart. Barriers can be useful in restaurant kitchens and at cash registers, host stands, or food pickup areas where maintaining physical distance of at least 6 feet is difficult.\nProvide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signage, to ensure that individuals remain at least 6 feet apart. Consider providing these guides where lines form, in the kitchen, and at the bar.\nCommunal Spaces\nClose shared spaces such as break rooms, if possible; otherwise stagger use and clean and disinfect between use.\nMaintaining Healthy Operations\nRestaurants and bars may consider implementing several strategies to maintain healthy operations.\n\nProtections for Employees at Higher Risk for Severe Illness from COVID-19\nOffer options for employees at higher risk for severe illness (including older adults and people of all ages with certain underlying medical conditions) that limits their exposure risk (e.g., modified job responsibilities such as managing inventory rather than working as a cashier, or managing administrative needs through telework).\nConsistent with applicable law, develop policies to protect the privacy of persons at higher risk for severe illness in accordance with applicable privacy and confidentiality laws and regulations.\nRegulatory Awareness\nBe aware of local or state policies and recommendations related to group gatherings to determine if events can be held.\nStaggered or Rotated Shifts and Sittings\nRotate or stagger shifts to limit the number of employees in the restaurant or bar at the same time.\nStagger and limit dining times to minimize the number of customers in the establishment.\nWhen possible, use flexible worksites (e.g., telework) and flexible work hours (e.g., staggered shifts) to help establish policies and practices for social distancing (maintaining distance of approximately 6 feet) between employees and others, especially if social distancing is recommended by state and local health authorities.\nGatherings\nAvoid group events, gatherings, or meetings where social distancing of at least 6 feet between people cannot be maintained.\nTravel and Transit\nFor employees who commute to work using public transportation or ride sharing, encourage them to use transportation options that minimize close contact with others (e.g., walking or biking, driving or riding by car \u2013 alone or with household members only) or consider offering the following support:\nAsk employees to follow the CDC guidance on how to Protect Yourself When Using Transportation.\nAllow employees to shift their hours so they can commute during less busy times.\nAsk employees to wash their hands as soon as possible after their trip.\nDesignated COVID-19 Point of Contact\nDesignate a staff person for each shift to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns. All staff members should know who this person is and how to contact them..\nCommunication Systems\nPut systems in place for:\nConsistent with applicable law and privacy policies, having staff self-report to the establishment\u2019s point of contact if they have symptoms of COVID-19, a positive test for COVID-19, or were exposed to someone with COVID-19 within the last 14 days in accordance with health information sharing regulations for COVID-19external icon (e.g. see \u201cNotify Health Officials and Close Contacts\u201d in the Preparing for When Someone Gets Sick section below), and other applicable privacy and confidentiality laws and regulations.\nNotifying staff, customers, and the public of business closures, and restrictions in place to limit COVID-19 exposure (e.g., limited hours of operation).\nLeave (Time Off) Policies\nImplement flexible sick leave policies and practices that enable employees to stay home when they are sick, have been exposed, or caring for someone who is sick.\nExamine and revise policies for leave, telework, and employee compensation.\nLeave policies should be flexible and not punish people for taking time off and should allow sick employees to stay home and away from co-workers. Leave policies should also account for employees who need to stay home with their children if there are school or childcare closures, or to care for sick family members.\nDevelop policies for return-to-work after COVID-19 illness.  CDC\u2019s criteria to discontinue home isolation can inform these policies.\nBack-Up Staffing Plan\nMonitor absenteeism of employees, cross-train staff, and create a roster of trained back-up staff.\nStaff Training\nTrain all employees in safety actions.\nConduct training virtually, or ensure that social distancing is maintained during training.\nRecognize Signs and Symptoms\nConduct daily health checks (e.g., temperature screening and/or or symptom checking) of staff safely and respectfully, and in accordance with any applicable privacy laws and regulations.\nConsider using examples of screening methods in CDC\u2019s General Business FAQs as a guide.\nSupport Coping and Resilience \nPromote employees eating healthy, exercising, getting sleep, and finding time to unwind.\nEncourage employees to talk with people they trust about their concerns and how they are feeling.\nConsider posting signs for the national distress hotline: 1-800-985-5990, or text TalkWithUs to 66746\nPreparing for Sick Employees\nRestaurants and bars may consider implementing several strategies to prepare for when someone gets sick.\n\nAdvise Sick Employees of Home Isolation Criteria\nCommunicate to sick employees that they should not return to work until they have met CDC\u2019s criteria to discontinue home isolation.\nIsolate and Transport Those Who are Sick\nMake sure that employees know they should not come to work if they are sick, and they should notify their manager or other designated COVID-19 point of contact if they become sick with COVID-19 symptoms, test positive for COVID-19, or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 symptoms or a confirmed or suspected case.\nImmediately separate employees or customers with COVID-19 symptoms (i.e., fever, cough, shortness of breath). Individuals who are sick should go home or to a healthcare facility, depending on how sever their symptoms are, and follow CDC guidance for caring for oneself and others who are sick.\nClean and Disinfect\nClose off areas used by a sick person and do not use these areas until after cleaning and disinfecting them.\nWait at least 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible. Ensure safe and correct use and storage of cleaning and disinfection productsexternal icon, including storing them securely away from children.\nNotify Health Officials and Close Contacts\nIn accordance with state and local laws, restaurant and bar operators should notify local health officials and staff immediately of any case of COVID-19 among employees, while maintaining confidentiality in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)external icon.\nAdvise those who have had close contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19 to stay home and self-monitor for symptoms, and follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop.

People at increased risk for severe illness include:\n\nOlder adults.\nPeople of any age who have underlying medical conditions.\nAs a hotel, resort, and lodge employer, your workforce might come into contact with the virus when\n\nIn close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes or more) with other people at the worksite, which can include guests or coworkers.\nTouching their mouth, nose or eyes after:\nShaking someone\u2019s hand.\nTouching surfaces in public areas such as the front desk/check-in counter and restrooms.\nTouching or handling items such as cash, pens at the front desk, room keys, key cards, or merchandise.\nTouching high-touch lobby surfaces such as tables, elevator buttons, water fountains, ATMs/card payment stations, and ice/vending machines.\nCleaning guest rooms.\nHow You Can Protect Your Staff and Others and Slow the Spread of COVID-19\nYou can protect workers by supporting them in maintaining both personal preventive behaviors (socially distancing, wearing cloth masks, washing hands) and environmental interventions. Evaluate your workplace to identify scenarios where workers cannot maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet from each other and/or guests. Use appropriate combinations of controls following the hierarchy of controls to address these situations to limit the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. A committee of both workers and management may be most effective at identifying all possible scenarios.\n\nWhile protecting workers, it is important to note that control recommendations or interventions to reduce exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) must be compatible with any safety programs and personal protective equipment (PPE) normally required for the job task. Approaches to consider may include the following:\n\nCreate a COVID-19 Workplace Health and Safety Plan\n\nReview the CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers and the Resuming Business Toolkit for guidelines and recommendations that all employers can use to protect their employees.\n\nContinue to follow any state or local regulations for hotels in addition to the recommendations here.\nIdentify an on-site workplace coordinator who will be responsible for COVID-19 assessment and control.\nIn addition to work areas, identify other areas that may lead to close contact (within 6 feet for 15 minutes) among employees, for example break rooms, outside patios, parking garages, inside lounging areas, dining areas/kitchenspdf iconexternal icon, game rooms, pools, hot tubs, saunas, spas, salons, lobbies, fitness centers, laundry rooms, and routes of entry and exit.\nWhen developing plans, include all employees in the workplace, for example: staff, utility employees, maintenance, supervisory staff, hotel management, facilities staff, security staff, and housekeeping/janitorial staff, and outside contractors who may enter the facility.\nIf hotel guests or contractors enter the workspace, develop plans to communicate with them regarding modification to work or service processes.\nNotify all workers that any COVID-19 concerns should be directed to the identified coordinator.\nImplement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices.\nDevelop policies that encourage sick employees to stay at home without fear of reprisals, and ensure employees are aware of these policies.\nMaintain flexible policies that permit employees to stay home to care for a sick family member or take care of children due to school and childcare closures.\nIf contractors are employed in the workplace, develop plans to communicate with the contracting company regarding modifications to work processes.\nConsider conducting daily in-person or virtual health checks (e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening) of employees on scheduled workdays.\nScreening options could include having employees self-screen before arriving at work or taking employees\u2019 temperatures and assessing potential symptoms prior to beginning work (see CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers).\nMake sure employees can maintain at least 6 feet of distance while waiting for screening, if done on site.\nMake employee health screenings as private as possible and maintain the confidentiality of each individual\u2019s medical status and history.\nTake action if an employee is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19\n\nImmediately separate employees who report with or develop symptoms at work from other employees and arrange for private transport home. These employees should self-isolate and contact their health care provider immediately.\nClose off any areas that were used for prolonged periods of time by the sick person, if it is practical to do so.\nPerform enhanced cleaning and disinfection after anyone suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 has been in the workplace. Cleaning staff should clean and disinfect offices, bathrooms, common areas, and shared equipment used by the sick person, focusing especially on frequently touched surfaces or objects. If other workers do not have access to these areas or items, wait 24 hours (or as long as possible) before cleaning and disinfecting.\nEmployees who test positive for COVID-19 should immediately notify their employer of their results.\nSick employees should follow CDC recommended steps to self-isolate or seek care. Employees should not return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, in consultation with healthcare providers.\nA test-based strategy is not recommended to validate an employee\u2019s illness, or to qualify an employee for sick leave or return to work.\nDevelop hazard controls using the hierarchy of controls to prevent infection among workers. You may be able to include a combination of controls noted below.\n\nEngineering Controls (Isolate people from the hazards)\nAlter the workspace using engineering controls to prevent exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19.\nModify the alignment of workstations where feasible. For example, redesign workstations so workers are not facing each other.\nMove electronic payment terminals/credit card readers farther away from the reception desk to increase the distance between the guest and hotel staff.\nUpdate floor plans for lobbies, lounges, and restaurants, and redesign seating arrangements to ensure social distancing.\nEstablish, where possible, physical barriers between workers, and between workers and hotel guests.\nUse strip curtains, plastic barriers, or similar materials to create impermeable dividers or partitions.\nConsider installing transparent shields or other barriers where social distancing is not an option (e.g., reception desk).\nClose or limit access to common areas where employees are likely to congregate and interact, such as break rooms, parking lots, and in entrance/exit areas.\nRemove or space appropriately the chairs in the waiting area to discourage social gathering.\nConsider making foot-traffic single direction in narrow or confined areas, such as aisles and stairwells, to encourage single-file movement at a 6-foot distance.\nUse visual cues such as floor decals, colored tape, and signs to remind workers to maintain a distance of 6 feet from others, including at their workstation and in break areas.\nConsider these cues for guests and contractors as well, such as at the entrance or reception desk line.\nPlace handwashing stations or hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol in multiple locations throughout the workplace for workers and hotel guests.\nUse touch-free stations where possible.\nMake sure restrooms are well stocked with soap and a way for people to dry their hands.\nMake sure the workspace is well ventilatedexternal icon.\nWork with facilities management to adjust the ventilation so that the maximum amount of fresh air is delivered to occupied spaces while maintaining the humidity at 40-60%. If possible, increase filter efficiency of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) units to highest functional level.\nPortable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration units may be considered to remove contaminants in the air of poorly ventilated areas.\nAdditional considerations for improving the building ventilation system can be found in the CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers and COVID-19 Employer Information for Office Buildings.\nFollow guidance for reopening buildings after a prolonged shutdown or reduced operation to help protect employees and occupants from mold and Legionnaires\u2019 disease.\nAdministrative Controls (Change the way people work)\nProvide training and other administrative policies to prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.\nAll workers should have a basic understanding of COVID-19, how the disease is thought to spread, what the symptoms of the disease are, and what measures can be taken to prevent or minimize the transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19.\nTrainings should include the importance of social distancing (maintaining a distance of 6 feet or more when possible), wearing cloth masks appropriately, covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands, cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces, not sharing personal items or tools/equipment unless absolutely necessary, and not touching their face, mouth, nose, or eyes.\nWorkers should be encouraged to go home or stay home if they feel sick. Ensure that sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance, and that employees are aware of and understand these policies.\nConsider maintaining small groups of workers in teams (cohorting) to reduce the number of coworkers each person is exposed to.\nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.\nIf surfaces are dirty, clean them using a detergent or soap and water before you disinfect them.\nUse products that are EPA registered for use against SARS-CoV-2external icon, diluted household bleach solutions, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, appropriate for surface disinfection.\nProvide cleaning materials and conduct targeted and more frequent cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched surfaces (guest rooms, break rooms, public areas, fitness centers, and conference rooms, countertops, doorknobs, toilets, tables, light switches, phones, faucets, sinks, keyboards, etc.)\nInstruct guests to return room keys/key cards in a designated bin upon departure for later disinfection.\nProvide disposable disinfectant wipes to reception desk staff and parking lot/valet staff to disinfect surfaces in between guest interactions.\nUse devices that do not require the employee to handle guests\u2019 credit and debit cards and institute a cashless policy. If this is not possible, ensure that cash and/or cards are handled with care by employees either by changing gloves between each transaction or using hand sanitizer between customers.\nProvide employees adequate time and access to soap, clean water, and a way to dry their hands for handwashing.\nRemind employees to wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, they should use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.\nProvide hand sanitizer, tissues and no touch waste baskets at the cash registers and in the restrooms.\nPlace hand sanitizer stations throughout the hotel, especially in common areas and outside of elevator doors.\nProvide tissues and no touch waste baskets at the reception desk, in restrooms, the lobby, and in meeting rooms.\nMaintain social distancing in the hotel, including at reception desks.\nLimit the number of people in the hotel at one time. (Consult state and local guidance if available.)\nFor room service, consider taking measures to ensure contactless delivery.\nLimit party size in common areas such as lobbies and lounges to no more than the established guideline recommended by your local/state health departments.\nMinimize traffic in enclosed spaces, such as elevators and stairwells. Consider limiting the number of individuals in an elevator at one time and designating one-directional stairwells, if possible.\nConsider restricting occupancy or closing areas that may generate high traffic such as hotel offices, conference rooms, restaurants and bars, fitness centers/sporting courts, and pools/saunas.\nConsider suspending concierge services that require staff to directly handle guests\u2019 items. This includes guest services such as luggage delivery, laundry service, and valet parking.\nUse technological solutions where possible to reduce person-to-person interaction such as online reservation and check-in, mobile room key, mobile access to menus, and contactless payment options.\nHousekeeping staff should:\nWash hands or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer before entering and after exiting a guestroom.\nDiscard all single use items either provided by the hotel or left by the guest.\nConduct targeted cleaning and disinfecting of high-touch surfaces such as tables, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, remote controls, phones, toilets, toilet flush handles, sink faucets, door handles, pens, and irons.\nWear disposable gloves when handling trash.\nWash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds immediately after handling waste.\nIf a guest is ill and isolating in their hotel room, discontinue all but essential housekeeping services to the room.\nAdditional precautions should be taken for cleaning a room after a guest who has been ill has checked out of the hotel:\nDo not let anyone enter the room previously occupied by the ill guest.\nWait at least 24 hours before you enter the room. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible.\nIf possible, open outside doors and windows to increase air circulation as long as this does not create any additional safety hazards to staff or guests.\nThoroughly clean and disinfect the room, as stated above.\nCarpeted areas should be cleaned using a vacuum equipped with a HEPA filter, if available.\nOnce the room has been appropriately cleaned and disinfected, it can be opened for guest use.\nWash all hotel linens according to the manufacturer\u2019s label and dry on the highest setting possible. Allow items to dry completely before removing.\nStaff should wear disposable gloves when handling dirty laundry. Wash hands immediately after removing gloves.\nDo not shake dirty laundry.\nRemind employees that people may be able to spread the virus that causes COVID-19 even if they do not show symptoms. Consider all close interactions (within 6 feet) with employees, hotel guests, and others as a potential source of exposure.\nPost signs and reminders at entrances and in strategic places providing instruction on social distancing, hand hygiene, use of cloth masks, and cough and sneeze etiquette. Signs should be accessible for people with disabilities, easy to understand, and may include signs for non-English speakers, as needed.\nCommunication and training should be accessible for people with disabilities, easy to understand, in preferred language(s) spoken or read by the employees and include accurate and timely information.\nEmphasize use of images (infographics) that account for language differences.\nTraining should be reinforced with signs (preferably infographics), placed in strategic locations. CDC has free, simple posters available to download and print, some of which are translated into different languages.\nUse cloth masks.\nCloth masks are intended to protect other people\u2014not the wearer. They are not considered to be PPE.\nEmphasize that care must be taken when putting on and taking off cloth masks to ensure that the worker or the cloth mask does not become contaminated.\nCloth masks should be routinely laundered, if possible.\nEnsure cloth masks do not create a new risk (i.e. interfere with driving or vision, or contribute to heat-related illness) that exceeds their COVID-19 related benefits of slowing the spread of the virus. Cloth masks should also not be worn by anyone who has trouble breathing or is unable to remove it without assistance. CDC provides information on adaptations and alternatives that should be considered when cloth masks may not be feasible (e.g., people who are deaf or hard of hearing, have intellectual or developmental disabilities, or sensory sensitivities).\nEmployees should consider carrying a spare cloth mask.\nIf the cloth mask becomes wet, visibly soiled, or contaminated at work, it should be removed and stored to be laundered later.\nConsider requiring visitors to the workplace (service personnel, guests) to also wear cloth masks.\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE)\nPPE is the last step in the hierarchy of controls because it is more difficult to use effectively than other measures. To be protective and not introduce an additional hazard, the use of PPE requires characterization of the environment, knowledge of the hazard, training, and consistent correct use. This is why special emphasis is given to administrative and engineering controls when addressing occupational hazards, including when applying guidance to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIn the current COVID-19 pandemic, use of PPE such as surgical masks or N95 respirators is being prioritized for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance, unless they were required for your job before the pandemic.\n\nAdditional Cleaning Guidance for Housekeeping\nIn addition to the cleaning guidance above, employees cleaning guestrooms should:\n\nWash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before entering and after exiting a guestroom. Use hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol if soap and water aren\u2019t available.\nThrow away all single-use items provided by the hotel or left by the guest.\nClean frequently touched surfaces such as tables, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, remote controls, phones, toilets, toilet flush handles, sink faucets, door handles, pens, and irons.\nWash all hotel linens according to the manufacturer\u2019s label and use the warmest appropriate water setting. Allow items to dry completely.\nWear disposable gloves when handling dirty laundry or trash.\nDo not shake dirty laundry.\nWash hands immediately after handling dirty laundry or trash.\nIf a guest is ill and isolating in their hotel room, discontinue all but essential housekeeping services to the room.\nAdditional precautions for cleaning a room after a guest who has been ill has checked out of the hotel:\nClose off the room.\nWait 24 hours before you enter the room. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible.\nIf possible, open outside doors and windows to increase air circulation.\nThoroughly clean and disinfect the room, as stated above.\nUse a vacuum equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, if available.\nAfter the room has been appropriately disinfected, it can be opened for guest use.\nWash your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You don\u2019t need to wear gloves if you wash your hands regularly (unless they are already required for your job).\n\nUse hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol if soap and water aren\u2019t available.\nWash your hands at these key times:\nBefore, during, and after preparing food.\nBefore eating food.\nAfter using the toilet.\nAfter blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.\nAfter putting on, touching, or removing cloth masks.\nBefore and after work and work breaks.\nBefore and after cleaning guestrooms.\nDo not touch your face, mouth, nose, or eyes.\n\nCover your coughs and sneezes.\n\nUse tissues to cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.\nThrow used tissues in the trash.\nWash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\nHow You Can Help Your Staff and Others Cope with Stress\nMental health and emotional well-being are important components of worker safety and health. The COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges in the ways many people work and interact with others, which may lead to increased feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression. It is important to pay attention to these in yourself and your staff and encourage staff to take advantage of available resources for managing mental health issues.\n\nInformation and resources about mental health, recognizing signs of stress, taking steps to build resilience and manage stress, and knowing where to go if you, your staff, or others need help are available here.",

The assay provides a sensitive, nucleic-acid-based diagnostic tool for evaluation of specimens from patients in the acute phase of infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for this test on July 2, 2020.\n\nThe multiplex assay\u2019s FDA-authorized Instructions for Useexternal icon contains information about the test and its intended use, the test procedure, and the test performance characteristics. The FDA Letter of Authorizationexternal icon for the multiplex assay can be found on the EUA websiteexternal icon. The letter defines the authorized use and the conditions of authorization that apply to CDC and other testing laboratories that use this test.\n\nHow Public Health Laboratories Order the Flu SC2 Multiplex Assay\nThe International Reagent Resource (IRR)external icon is distributing the Flu SC2 Multiplex Assay and supplies to registered state and local public health laboratories so that they can perform testing with this assay.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, state public health laboratories can authorize county or city laboratories in their state to perform testing. These laboratories must be certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) to perform high-complexity tests, have appropriate laboratory equipment and training, and demonstrate testing proficiency under their state laboratory\u2019s stewardship to maintain their status as an IRR-registered laboratory. The IRR does not supply clinicians, hospitals, or healthcare professionals with testing kits directly. A list of commercially available primers and probes for use with this test is not available at this time. However, CDC has shared the primers and probes sequences, so other laboratories and companies may manufacture their own reagents.\n\nMaterials included in the assay The CDC Flu SC2 Multiplex Assay is a quadruplex assay that includes:\n\nOne primer mix and one probe mix. Primers and probes target:\nVirus nucleocapsid (N) gene for specific detection of SARS-CoV-2\nMatrix (M1) gene for specific detection of influenza A virus\nNonstructural 2 (NS2) gene for specific detection of influenza B virus\nRNase P gene (RP) for specific detection of human nucleic acid that serves as an internal control\nA positive control FluSC2PC that confirms all four targets in the assay are working correctly\nOther materials labs need to perform the assay\nThe Flu SC2 Multiplex Assay requires the use of additional authorized materials that are not included with the test. These materials include PCR reagents, equipment, and supplies commonly used in clinical laboratories such as a microcentrifuge, microcentrifuge tubes, pipettes, and pipette tips. They are described starting on page 5 in the authorized Flu SC2 Multiplex Assay Instructions for Useexternal icon. Two control materials are also required but not provided. These materials must produce expected results for a test to be considered valid, as outlined in the Flu SC2 Multiplex Assay Instructions for Use. The controls are the following:\n\nHuman specimen control (HSC): A human cell culture preparation used as an extraction procedural control to demonstrate successful recovery of nucleic acid, as well as extraction reagent integrity. Acceptable alternatives to HSC are listed in the Instructions for Use.\nNo template control (NTC): Nuclease-free water included in each run. This control monitors for reagent and system contamination.",

            "Text": "1. Background/Purpose\nThis document is intended for healthcare facilities that are receiving or are preparing to receive patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This includes healthcare facilities providing either inpatient or outpatient services.  It should be used to guide implementation of procedures at triage that can be effective at preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus) to patients and healthcare workers (HCWs). This document was developed based on current COVID-19 data and experience with other respiratory viruses and will be updated as more information becomes available.\n\n1.1 What is triage\n\u201cThe sorting out and classificationexternal icon of patientsexternal icon or casualties to determine priority of need and proper place of treatmentexternal icon.\u201d1   During infectious disease outbreaks, triage is particularly important to separate patients likely to be infected with the pathogen of concern.  This triage SOP is developed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and does not replace any routine clinical triage already in place in healthcare facilities (e.g. Manchester triage system or equivalent2) to categorize patients into different urgency categories.\n\n1.2 COVID-19 transmission\nThe main route of transmission of COVID-19 is through respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes.  Any person who is in close contact with someone who has respiratory symptoms (e.g., sneezing, coughing, etc.) is at risk of being exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets.3   Droplets may also land on surfaces where the virus could remain viable for several hours to days. Transmission can occur from hands contacting contaminated surfaces and then coming into contact with the person\u2019s mucosa such as nose, mouth and eyes.\n\n2. What patients can do before and upon arrival to a healthcare facility\nInform healthcare providers if they are seeking care for COVID-19 symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue, headache, shortness of breath, loss of smell or taste, sore throat or other 4 by calling ahead of time.\nWear a medical mask (e.g., surgical or procedure masks) and, if not available, wear a cloth or fabric mask during transport and while at triage in the healthcare facility.5\nNotify triage registration desk about symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 as soon as they arrive.\nWash hands at healthcare facility entrance with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub.\nCarry paper or fabric tissues to cover mouth or nose when coughing or sneezing. Dispose paper tissues in a trash can immediately after use.\nMaintain social distance by staying at least one meter away according to WHO guidance3, whenever possible, from anyone, including anyone that is with the patient (e.g., companion or caregiver).\n3. What healthcare facilities can do to minimize risk of infection among patients and healthcare workers\nCommunicate with patients before arriving for triage\nEstablish a hotline that:\nPatients can call or text notifying the facility that they are seeking care due to COVID-19 symptoms.\nCan be used, if possible, as telephone consultation for patients to determine the need to visit a healthcare facility.\nServes to inform patients of preventive measures to take as they come to the facility (e.g., wearing mask, having tissues to cover cough or sneeze).\nProvide information to the general public through local mass media such as radio, television, newspapers, and social media platforms about availability of a hotline and the signs and symptoms of COVID-19.\nHealthcare facilities, in conjunction with national authorities, should consider telemedicine (e.g., telephone, audio-video calls, or secure messaging) to provide clinical support without direct contact with the patient.6 However, patients with any emergency warning signs such as trouble breathing, new confusion, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, or inability to wake or stay awake should seek medical care immediately.\nSet up and equip triage\nLimit point of entry to the health facility.\nHave clear signs at the entrance of the facility directing patients with COVID-19 symptoms to immediately report to the registration desk in the emergency department or at the unit they are seeking care (e.g., maternity, pediatric, HIV clinic) (Appendix 1). Facilities should consider having a separate registration desk for patients coming in with COVID-19 symptoms, especially at the emergency departments, and clear signs at the entrance directing patients to the designated registration desk.\nEnsure availability of medical masks and paper tissue at registration desk, as well as nearby hand hygiene stations. A bin with lid should be available at triage where patients can discard used paper tissues.\nInstall physical barriers (e.g., glass or plastic screens) for registration desk (i.e., reception area) and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter to limit close contact between registration desk personnel and potentially infectious patients.\nEnsure availability of hand hygiene stations in triage area, including waiting areas.\nPost visual alerts at the entrance of the facility and in strategic areas (e.g., waiting areas or elevators) about respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette and social distancing. This includes how to cover nose and mouthpdf icon when coughing or sneezing and disposal of contaminated items in trash cans.\nAssign dedicated clinical staff (e.g. physicians or nurses) for physical evaluation of patients presenting with COVID-19 symptoms at triage. These staff should be trained on triage procedures, COVID-19 case definition, and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) use (i.e., mask, eye protection, gown and gloves).\nTrain administrative personnel working in the reception area on how to perform hand hygiene, maintain appropriate distance, and on how to advise patients on the proper use of medical masks, hand hygiene, and separation from other patients.\nA standardized triage algorithm/questionnaire should be available for use and should include questions that will determine if the patient meets the COVID-19 case definition4,7 (Appendix 2). Algorithms should be adjusted based on settings and epidemiologic considerations in each country. HCWs should be encouraged to have a high level of clinical suspicion of COVID-19 given the global pandemic.\nSet up a \u201crespiratory waiting area\u201d for suspected COVID-19 patients\nHealthcare facilities without enough single isolation rooms or those located in areas with high community transmission should designate a separate, well-ventilated area where patients at high risk* for COVID-19 can wait. This area should have benches, stalls or chairs separated by at least one-meter distance. The waiting areas should have dedicated toilets and hand hygiene stations. Patients who are suspected to have COVID-19 should not be mixed with COVID-19 confirmed patients in isolation areas.4\nPost clear signs informing patients of the location of waiting areas for suspected COVID-19. Train the registration desk staff to direct patients immediately to these areas after registration.\nProvide paper tissues, alcohol-based hand rub, and trash bins with lids for the separate COVID-19 waiting area.\nDevelop a process to reduce the amount of time patients are in the COVID-19 waiting area, which may include:\nAllocation of additional staff to triage patients suspected of COVID-19\nSetting up a notification system that allows patients to wait in a personal vehicle or outside of the facility (if medically appropriate) in a place where social distance can be maintained and they can be easily notified by phone or other remote methods when it is their turn to be evaluated.\nTriage process\nA medical mask should be given to patients with respiratory symptoms as soon as they get to the facility if they do not already have one. All patients in the separate COVID-19 waiting area should wear a medical mask.\nIf medical masks are not available, provide paper tissues or request the patient to cover their nose and mouth with a scarf, bandana, or T-shirt during the entire triage process, including while in the COVID-19 waiting area. A homemade cloth mask can also be used as source control, if the patient has one. Exercise caution as these items will become contaminated and can serve as a source of transmission to other patients or family members. WHO\u2019s guidance should be followed by patients and family members to clean these items. (https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-on-infection-prevention-and-control-for-health-care-workers-caring-for-patients-with-suspected-or-confirmed-2019-ncovexternal icon).\nUse a standardized triage algorithm (Appendix 2) to immediately isolate/separate patients at high risk* for having COVID-19 in single-person rooms with doors closed or designated COVID-19 waiting areas.\nLimit the number of accompanying family members in the waiting area for suspected COVID-19 patients (do not allow children aged <18 years unless a patient or a parent). Anyone in the separate waiting area for suspected COVID-19 should wear a medical mask. If medical mask is not available, wear a cloth mask or use multiple layers paper tissues or other fabrics such as T-shirts or scarfs to cover their nose and mouth.\nTriage area, including a separate waiting area for suspected COVID-19, should be cleaned at least twice a day with a focus on frequently touched surfaces. Disinfection can be done with 1% (1000ppm) chlorinepdf icon or 70% alcohol for surfaces that do not tolerate chlorine. For large blood and body fluid spills, 0.5% (5000ppm) chlorinepdf icon is recommended.8\n*defined as patients at high risk for having COVID-19 based on clinical and epidemiologic criteria (e.g., travel history or exposure to someone with confirmed or suspected COVID-19). Definition may change depending on where countries or regions within countries are in the stage of outbreak (e.g. no or limited vs. widespread community transmission). See Appendix 3 for the different epidemiologic scenarios. \n\n4. What healthcare workers (HCWs) can do to protect themselves and their patients during triage\nAll HCWs should adhere to Standard Precautions, which includes hand hygiene, selection of PPE based on risk assessment, respiratory hygiene, cleaning and disinfection and injection safety practices.\nAll HCWs should be trained on and familiar with infection prevention and control (IPC) precautions (e.g. contact and droplet precautions, appropriate hand hygiene, donning and doffing of PPE) related to COVID-19.\nFollow appropriate PPE donning and doffing steps.\nPerform frequent hand hygiene with an alcohol-based hand rub if your hands are not visibly dirty or with soap and water if hands are dirty.\nHCWs who come in contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients should wear appropriate PPE:\nHCWs in triage areas who are conducting preliminary screening do not require PPE if they DO NOT have direct contact with the patient and MAINTAIN distance of at least one meter. Examples:\nHCWs at the registration desk that are asking limited questions based on triage protocol. Installation of physical barriers (e.g., glass or plastic screens) are encouraged if possible.\nHCWs providing medical masks or taking temperatures with infrared thermometers as long as a distance of at least one meter can be safely maintained.\nWhen physical distance is NOT feasible and yet NO direct contact with patients occurs, use a medical mask and eye protection (face shield or goggles).\nHCWs conducing physical examination of patients with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 should wear gowns, gloves, a medical mask and eye protection (goggles or face shield).\nCleaners in triage, waiting and examination areas should wear a gown, heavy duty gloves, a medical mask, eye protection (if risk of splash from organic material or chemical), boots or closed work shoes.\nHCWs who develop symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath, loss of smell or taste, sore throat) should stay home and not perform triage or any other duties at the healthcare facility.\nEnsure that environmental cleaning and disinfection procedures are followed consistently and correctly (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/water-sanitation-hygiene-and-waste-management-for-covid-19external icon ).\n5. Additional considerations for triage during periods of community transmission\nBegin or reinforce existing alternatives to face-to-face triage and visits such as telemedicine.6\nDesignate an area near the facility (e.g., an ancillary building or temporary structure) or identify a location in the area to be a \u201cCOVID-19 evaluation center\u201d where patients with symptoms of COVID-19 can seek evaluation and care.\nExpand hours of operation, if possible, to limit crowding at triage during peak hours.\nCancel non-urgent outpatient visits to ensure enough HCWs are available to provide support for COVID-19 clinical care, including triage services. Critical or urgent outpatient visits (e.g. infant vaccination or prenatal checkup for high-risk pregnancy) should continue, however, facilities should ensure separate/dedicated entry for patients coming for critical outpatient visits to not place them at risk of COVID-19.\nConsider postponing or cancelling elective procedures and surgeries depending on the local epidemiologic context.",

            "HeadLine": "Interim SARS-CoV-2 Testing Guidelines for Patients in Outpatient Hemodialysis Facilities",
            "Text": "Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance dialysis are at high risk for serious illness and death related to infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Most patients on maintenance dialysis undergo hemodialysis three times a week at outpatient dialysis centers. At each treatment, dialysis facilities should assess patients for symptoms consistent with COVID-19 or exposure to others with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nTesting for SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens can detect current infections (referred to here as viral testing) among patients in outpatient dialysis facilities. Viral testing of patients in outpatient dialysis facilities, with authorized nucleic acid or antigen detection assays, can be an important addition to other infection prevention and control (IPC) recommendations aimed at preventing SARS-CoV-2 from entering dialysis facilities, detecting cases quickly, and stopping transmission.  This guidance is based on currently available information about SARS-CoV-2 and will be refined and updated as more information becomes available.\n\nTesting conducted at dialysis facilities should be implemented in addition to recommended IPC measures. Not all dialysis facilities can perform on-site testing; however, all facilities should have a plan for testing patients for SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., identify where patients will be referred for testing if the dialysis facility cannot perform onsite testing).\n\nTesting practices (including performing tests and reporting results) should aim for rapid turnaround times (i.e., less than 48 hours) in order to facilitate effective interventions. Collecting a new specimen for a second test in the same patient more than once in a 24-hour period is generally not recommended unless the second test is being used to confirm an initial result (e.g., nucleic acid detection to confirm antigen test result).  Antibody (serologic) test results should not be used to diagnose an active SARS-CoV-2 infection or to inform IPC actions.\n\nWhile this guidance focuses on testing patients undergoing hemodialysis at outpatient hemodialysis facilities, several of the recommendations \u2013 such as testing patients with signs or symptoms of COVID-19 and testing asymptomatic close contacts \u2013 should also be applied to ESRD patients undergoing home dialysis (i.e., home hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis).\n\nCMS has suggested that routine testing could be considered for nursing home residents who regularly leave the facility including for dialysis. Centers who dialyze these patients should have a plan to address residents who are found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, including working to establish lines of communication so that results of resident testing are rapidly communicated and acted on.\n\nFor additional guidance addressing other non-healthcare settings, refer to the CDC guidance addressing Communities, Schools, Workplaces and Events. Guidance for testing healthcare personnel (HCP) is available in the Interim Guidance on Testing Healthcare Personnel for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nTesting patients with signs or symptoms of COVID-19\nEvery time a patient presents to the facility for a dialysis treatment, evaluate for any COVID-19 symptoms. Perform viral testing of any patient who has signs or symptoms of COVID-19.\nClinicians should use professional judgment to determine if a patient has signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested. Individuals with ESRD and COVID-19 may not show common symptoms such as fever or respiratory symptoms.  Some patients might present with only mild symptoms or other less common symptoms. Even mild signs and symptoms (e.g., sore throat) of a possible SARS-CoV-2 infection should prompt consideration for testing\nClinicians are encouraged to consider testing for other causes of respiratory illness, such as influenza, in addition to testing for SARS-CoV-2.\nPatients should be cared for by HCP using all personal protective equipment (PPE) and precautions described for patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection while waiting for results of the test to return.\nTesting asymptomatic patients with known or suspected exposure to an individual infected with SARS-CoV-2, including close and expanded contacts (e.g., there is an outbreak in the facility) to control transmission\nEvery time a patient presents to the facility assess for any recent exposure to others with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nPatients undergoing outpatient dialysis might have exposures to individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection inside and outside of the dialysis facility. It is important that patients are screened for any potential exposures each time they undergo treatment so IPC measures can be promptly implemented and testing can be performed in an expeditious manner to prevent transmission to other patients or HCP.\nBecause of the potential for asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection to other vulnerable individuals and HCP in the dialysis facility, it is important that dialysis patients that have been close contacts of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection be quickly identified and tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nFacilities should maintain at least 6 feet of separation between patients who had close contact with a person with SARS-CoV-2 infection and other patients during dialysis treatment; they should not be cohorted with each other or with patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. HCP caring for patients who were close contacts of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection should use all recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) for the care of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nBecause patients can develop SARS-CoV-2 infection at any point during their 14-day exposure period, such safeguards should remain in place for 14 days after the exposure event, even if viral testing of the exposed patient is negative during this time period.\nIf the exposed patient is within 90 days of being diagnosed with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, has completed their recommended duration of isolation precautions, and is currently asymptomatic, they do not need to be tested or managed with Transmission-Based Precautions.  However, if these individuals develop new symptoms consistent with COVID-19 they should be placed on Transmission-Based Precautions, assessed, and potentially tested for SARS-CoV-2 if an alternate etiology is not identified.\nFollow local regulations regarding reporting newly identified infections to public health authorities.\nIf there is an outbreak in the facility (i.e., evidence of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the dialysis facility or multiple patients or HCP with recent-onset SARS-CoV-2 infection), consider performing expanded viral testing of all patients and HCP in the dialysis facility or all patients and HCP that had dialysis treatments or worked on the same shift or day (i.e., expanded contacts beyond close contacts)\nSince patients can develop a SARS-CoV-2 infection due to exposure outside of the dialysis facility, identifying transmission within a dialysis facility can be challenging. SARS-CoV-2 infections among healthcare personnel (HCP) or patients with epidemiologic links within the dialysis facility and no other identified exposures suggest that transmission may have occurred within the dialysis facility. Transmission within a dialysis facility should be considered an outbreak, and the health department should be notified.\nPerforming viral testing of all patients, as soon as transmission within the facility is suspected, will allow for identification of infected patients quickly, assisting in their clinical management and allowing rapid implementation of IPC interventions (e.g., isolation, cohorting, use of PPE) to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission.\nFollow up testing (e.g., every 3 to 7 days) should be considered if additional SARS-CoV-2 infections are identified in the initial round of testing.\nFacility-wide viral testing might identify asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection; facility leadership should be prepared to continue to provide dialysis and isolate patients as needed.\nTesting of HCP should also be included as part of the response to the outbreak. For additional details see the Interim Guidance on Testing Healthcare Personnel for SARS-CoV-2.\nIf viral testing capacity is limited, additional considerations can be used to direct testing.\nFor example, if cases are identified in patients on a particular dialysis schedule or shift (e.g., Monday/Wednesday/Friday), testing could be performed in all patients on that schedule instead of facility wide.\nFor considerations on performing expanded testing, See Performing Broad-Based Testing for SARS-CoV-2 in Congregate Settings, which can be adapted to dialysis settings.\nNotify local public health authorities of suspected or confirmed outbreaks in the dialysis facility.\nTesting to determine resolution of infection\nIn general, a symptom-based strategy should be used to guide the decision on when to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions because, in most cases, the test-based strategy results in prolonged isolation of patients who continue to shed detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA but are no longer infectious. A test-based strategy could be considered for some patients (e.g., those who are severely immunocompromised) in consultation with local infectious diseases experts if concerns exist for the patient being infectious for more than 10 to 20 days. In all other circumstances, the symptom-based strategy should be used to determine when to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions.",

            "Text": "Considerations for schools\nAs communities in the United States consider how to safely re-open K-12 school buildings and in-person services, CDC offers updated considerations for mitigation strategies that K-12 school administrators can use to help protect students, teachers, and staff and slow the spread of COVID-19.  These updated Considerations for Schools are intended to aid school administrators as they consider how to protect the health, safety, and wellbeing of students, teachers, staff, their families, and communities:\n\nPromoting behaviors that reduce COVID-19\u2019s spread\nMaintaining healthy environments\nMaintaining healthy operations\nPreparing for when someone gets sick\nSchools should determine, in collaboration with state and local health officials to the extent possible, whether and how to implement each of these considerations while adjusting to meet the unique needs and circumstances of the local community. Implementation should be guided by what is feasible, practical, acceptable, and tailored to the needs of each community. It is also critically important to develop strategies that can be revised and adapted depending on the level of viral transmission in the school and throughout the community and done with close communication with state and/or local public health authorities and recognizing the differences between school districts, including urban, suburban, and rural districts. These considerations are meant to supplement\u2014not replace\u2014any Federal, state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which schools must comply (e.g., Individuals with Disabilities Education Actexternal icon).\n\nSchool-based health facilities may refer to CDC\u2019s Guidance for U.S. Healthcare Facilities and may find it helpful to reference the Ten Ways Healthcare Systems Can Operate Effectively During the COVID-19 Pandemic.\n\nMore information for schools\nAfter reviewing the suggestions listed on this page, school administrators can use CDC\u2019s School Considerations: Readiness and Action Planning Toolpdf icon to protect students, staff and communities.\n\nSchool-based health facilities may refer to CDC\u2019s Guidance for U.S. Healthcare Facilities and may find it helpful to reference the Ten Ways Healthcare Systems Can Operate Effectively During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Guiding principles to keep in mind\nEveryone\u2019s goal is to prioritize the reopening of schools as safely and as quickly as possible given the many known and established benefits of in-person learning. In order to enable this and assist schools with their day-to-day operations, it is important to adopt and diligently implement actions to slow the spread of COVID-19 inside the school and out in the community. Vigilance to these actions will moderate the risk of in-school transmission regardless of the underlying community burden \u2013 with risk being the lowest if community transmission is low and there is fidelity to implementing proven mitigation strategies.\n\nThe statement The Importance of Reopening America\u2019s Schools this Fall highlights that parents and school leaders are very eager for schools to reopen, but understandably concerned about the health and safety of their children during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nChildren and COVID-19\nIn general, children with COVID-19 are less likely to have severe symptoms than adults or experience an asymptomatic infection \u2013 meaning they do not have any signs or symptoms of disease (1-7).\n\nAnalysis of pediatric COVID-19 hospitalization data from 14 states from early March to late July 2020 found the cumulative rate of COVID-19\u2013associated hospitalization among children was over 20 times lower compared to adults (8.0 versus 164.5 per 100,000 population) (8). Although the cumulative rate is low, one in three children hospitalized with COVID-19 was admitted to an intensive care unit so the risk is not negligible (8). Similarly, the death rate among school-aged children is much lower than the rate among adults (9, 10). Also, the comparatively low risk for hospitalization and death among children themselves must be contextualized to the risk posed to teachers, school administrators, and other staff in the school environment. The risk of teachers, school administrators, and other staff in the school is expected to mirror that of other adults in the community if they contract COVID-19.\n\nTo be sure, the best available evidence from countries that have reopened schools indicates that COVID-19 poses low risks to school-aged children \u2013 at least in areas with low community transmission. That said, the body of evidence is growing that children of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (3-7) and, contrary to early reports (11, 12), might play a role in transmission (7, 13, 14).\n\nThe many benefits of in-person schooling should be weighed against the risks posed by COVID-19 spread. Of key significance, in-person learning is in the best interest of students, when compared to virtual learning. Application and adherence to mitigation measures provided in this document and similar to those implemented at essential workplaces can help schools reopen and stay open safely for in-person learning.\n\nDeciding how to reopen\nSchool officials should make decisions about school reopening based on available data including levels of community transmission and their capacity to implement appropriate mitigation measures in schools to protect students, teachers, administrators, and other staff. Schools should also consider other aspects of students\u2019 risk and wellbeing that arise when schools do not reopen for in-person classes. This includes the potential adverse impacts on students\u2019 social-emotional, behavioral, and mental health, as well as the critical services provided to students to help mitigate health disparities and serve children in need, such as school lunch programs, special education services, after-school programs and mental health services.\n\nThe unique and critical role that schools play makes them a priority for reopening and remaining open, enabling students to receive both academic instruction and enable the provision of other critical services and supports. By strictly implementing mitigation strategies, schools will be able to meet the needs of their students and community, while reducing the risk of COVID-19 spread. Taking actions to lower the risk of COVID-19 spread\nCOVID-19 is mostly spread by respiratory droplets released when people talk, cough, or sneeze. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own eyes, nose, or mouth. Therefore, personal prevention practices (such as handwashing, staying home when sick) and environmental cleaning and disinfection are important principles that are discussed below. Fortunately, there are a number of actions school administrators can take to help lower the risk of COVID-19 exposure and spread during school sessions and activities.\n\nIn order to reach the goal of reopening schools as safely and as quickly as possible for in-person learning, and help schools remain open, it is important to adopt and diligently implement actions to slow the spread of COVID-19 inside the school and out in the community.  This means that students, families, teachers, school staff, and all community members take actions to protect themselves and others where they live, work, learn, and play.\n\nContinuum of risk\nBy model of learning and implementation of proven mitigation strategies\nIn general, the risk of COVID-19 spread in schools increases across the continuum of virtual, hybrid, to in-person learning with the risk moderated for hybrid and in-person learning based upon the range of mitigation strategies put in place and the extent they are conscientiously followed.\n\nWhile not exhaustive, this stratification attempts to characterize the risks of spread among students, teachers, and staff across this continuum:\n\nLowest risk:\n\nStudents and teachers engage in virtual-only classes, activities, and events\nSome risk:\n\nHybrid Learning Model: Some students participate in virtual learning and other students participate in in-person learning\nSmall, in-person classes, activities, and events\nCohorting, alternating schedules, and staggered schedules are applied rigorously\nNo mixing of groups of students and teachers throughout/across school days\nStudents and teachers do not share objects\nStudents, teachers, and staff follow all steps to protect themselves and others at all times including proper use of face masks, social distancing, hand hygiene\nRegularly scheduled (i.e., at least daily or between uses) cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched areas implemented with fidelity\nMedium risk:\n\nHybrid Learning Model: Most students participate in in-person learning, some students participate in virtual learning\nLarger in-person classes, activities, and events\nCohorting, alternating schedules, and staggered schedules are applied with some exceptions\nSome mixing of groups of students and teachers throughout/across school days\nStudents and teachers minimally share objects\nStudents, teachers, and staff follow all steps to protect themselves and others such as proper use of face masks, social distancing, hand hygiene\nRegularly scheduled cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched areas largely implemented with fidelity\nHigher risk:\n\nStudents and teachers engage in in-person only learning, activities, and events\nStudents minimally mix between classes and activities\nStudents and teachers share some objects\nStudents, teachers, and staff follow some steps to protect themselves and others at all times such as proper use of face masks, social distancing, hand hygiene\nIrregular cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched areas\nHighest risk:\n\nStudents and teachers engage in in-person only learning, activities, and events\nStudents mix freely between classes and activities\nStudents and teachers freely share objects\nStudents, teachers, and staff do not/are not required to follow steps to protect themselves and others such as proper use of face masks, social distancing, hand hygiene\nIrregular cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched areas Plan and prepare\nEmergency operations plans: review, update, and implement EOPs\nThe most important actions for school administrators to take before reopening in-person services and facilities are planning and preparing. To best prepare, schools should expect that students, teachers, or staff may contract symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and schools must know what to do when this happens. Regardless of the number of cases in a community, every school should have a plan in place to protect staff, children, and their families from the spread of COVID-19 and a response plan in place for if/when a student, teacher, or staff member tests positive for COVID-19. This plan should be developed in collaboration with state and local public health departments; school nurses, parents, caregivers, and guardians; student leaders; community members; and other relevant partners. Schools should prioritize EOP components that address infectious disease outbreaks and their consequences.\n\nReference key resources on emergency preparedness while reviewing, updating, and implementing the EOP.\nMultiple federal agencies have developed resources on school planning principles and a 6-step processpdf iconexternal icon for creating plans to build and continually foster safe and healthy school communities before, during, and after possible emergencies.\nThe Readiness and Emergency Management for Schools (REMS) Technical Assistance Center\u2019s websiteexternal icon contains free resources, trainings, and technical assistance (TA) for schools and their community partners, including many tools and resources on emergency planning and response to infectious disease outbreaks. Schools may find these considerations are helpful for developing high-quality emergency operations plans.\nSchool nurses, teachers, staff, parents, student leaders, and other community stakeholders (e.g., youth service organizations, health centers, etc.) should be involved in the development of the Emergency Operations Plans (EOP). Some of the strategies school administrators should consider while developing their EOP:\n\nDevelop a protocol for monitoring local COVID-19 data in your community to keep track of the level of community transmission, to make decisions about changes to mitigation strategies, and to help determine whether school closures may be necessary. This should include daily review of official public health data for the community surrounding the school. Contact the state, local, tribal, or territorial Public Health Department for references to local COVID-19 data.\nDevelop and test information-sharing systems (e.g., school-to-parent email or texting protocols, periodic virtual meetings with parent/teachers, etc.) with school and community partners and key stakeholders. Use institutional information systems for day-to-day reporting on information that can help to detect and respond to an outbreak, such as number of cases and absenteeism or changes in the number of visits to the health center by students, teachers, and other staff.\nAdopt mitigation strategies to promote healthy behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19, maintain healthy school environments and operations, and plan what to do if a student, teacher, or staff member gets sick.\nExamine the accessibility of information and resources to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and maintain healthy environments and determine whether they are culturally relevant, in plain language, and available in appropriate languages and accessible formats.\nIn consultation with local officials, establish transparent criteria for when the school will suspend in-person learning to stop or slow the spread of COVID-19, as well as transparent criteria for when to resume in-person learning.\nAssess students\u2019 special needs (such as continuing education, meal programs, and other services) and develop strategies to address these needs if in-person learning is suspended or if a student needs to self-isolate as a result of a diagnosis of or exposure to COVID-19.\nEnsure the EOP takes into consideration students with disabilities, students with special healthcare needs, students experiencing homelessness, migrant students and those with English learners, etc. Promote behaviors that reduce spread of COVID-19\n\nSchools may consider implementing several strategies to encourage behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19.\n\nStaying home when appropriate\n\nEducate staff and families about when they/their child(ren) should stay home and when they can return to school.\n\nActively encourage employees and students who are sick or who have recently had close contact (less than 6 feet for fifteen minutes or more) with a person with COVID-19 to stay home. Develop policies that encourage sick employees and students to stay at home without fear of reprisal, and ensure employees, students, and students\u2019 families are aware of these policies. Consider not assessing schools based on absenteeism, and offering virtual learning and telework options, if feasible.\nStaff and students should stay home if they have tested positive for or are showing COVID-19 symptoms.\nStaff and students who have recently had close contact with a person with COVID-19 should also stay home and monitor their health.\nCDC\u2019s criteria can help inform when employees should return to work:\nIf they have been sick with COVID-19\nIf they have recently had close contact with a person with COVID-19\nHand hygiene and respiratory etiquette\n\nTeach and reinforce handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and increase monitoring to ensure adherence among students and staff.\nEncourage staff and students to cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Used tissues should be thrown in the trash and hands washed immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\nIf soap and water are not readily available, hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol should be used (for staff and older children who can safely use hand sanitizer).\nMasks\n\nTeach and reinforce use of masks. The use of masks is one of many important mitigation strategies to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Masks are meant to protect other people in case the wearer is unknowingly infected but does not have symptoms. Masks are not Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (e.g., surgical masks, respirators).\nAppropriate and consistent use of masks is most important when students, teachers, and staff are indoors and when social distancing is difficult to implement or maintain. Individuals should be frequently reminded not to touch the face covering or mask and to wash their hands or use hand sanitizer frequently. Information should be provided to staff, students, and students\u2019 families on proper use, removal, and washing of masks.\nMasks should not be placed on:\nChildren younger than 2 years old\nAnyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious\nAnyone who is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance\nAppropriate and consistent use of masks may be challenging for some students, teachers, and staff, including:\nYounger students, such as those in early elementary school (Pre-K through 3rd grade).\nStudents, teachers, and staff with severe asthma or other breathing difficulties.\nStudents, teachers, and staff with special educational or healthcare needs, including intellectual and developmental disabilities, mental health conditions, and sensory concerns or tactile sensitivity.\nWhile masks are strongly encouraged to reduce the spread of COVID-19, CDC recognizes there are specific instances when wearing a mask may not be feasible. In these instances, parents, guardians, caregivers, teachers, staff, and school administrators should consider adaptations and alternatives whenever possible. They may need to consult with healthcare providers for advice about wearing masks.\nPeople who are deaf or hard of hearing\u2014or those who care for or interact with a person who is hearing impaired\u2014may be unable to wear masks if they rely on lipreading to communicate. This may be particularly relevant for faculty or staff teaching or working with students who may be deaf or hard of hearing. In this situation, consider using a clear mask that covers the nose and wraps securely around the face. If a clear mask isn\u2019t available, consider whether faculty and staff can use written communication (including closed captioning) and decrease background noise to improve communication while wearing a mask that blocks your lips.\nMasks are recommended as a simple barrier to help prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air and onto other people when the person wearing the mask coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice. This is called source control.\nIn addition to those who interact with people who are deaf or hard of hearing, the following groups of teachers and staff may also consider using clear masks:\nTeachers of young students (e.g., teaching young students to read).\nTeachers of students who are English language learners\nTeachers of students with disabilities\nClear masks should be determined not to cause any breathing difficulties or over heating for the wearer. Clear masks are not face shields. CDC does not recommend use of face shields for normal everyday activities or as a substitute for masks because of a lack of evidence of their effectiveness to control the spread of the virus from the source for source control.\nAdequate supplies\n\nSupport healthy hygiene behaviors by providing adequate supplies, including soap and water, hand sanitizer with at least 60%  alcohol (for staff and older children who can safely use hand sanitizer), paper towels, tissues, disinfectant wipes, masks (as feasible) and no-touch/foot-pedal trash cans.\n\nSigns and messages\n\nPost signs in highly visible locations (e.g., school entrances, restrooms) that promote everyday protective measurespdf icon and describe how to stop the spreadpdf icon of germs (such as by properly washing hands and properly wearing a maskimage icon). Signs should include visual cues (such as clear, easy-to-understand pictures demonstrating the healthy behaviors) at the appropriate reading and literacy level.\nBroadcast regular announcements on reducing the spread of COVID-19 on PA systems.\nUse simple, clear, and effective language about behaviors that prevent spread of COVID-19 when communicating with staff and families (such as on school websites, in emails, and through school social media accounts). If feasible, provide communication in multiple languages.\nUse communication methods that are accessible for all students, faculty, and staff, including those with disabilities.\nTranslate materials into common languages spoken by students, faculty, and staff and people in the school community.\nFind freely available CDC print and digital resources on CDC\u2019s communications resources main page. CDC also has American Sign Language videos related to COVID-19 and other communication tools. Maintaining healthy environments\n\nSchool administrators may consider implementing several strategies to maintain healthy environments.\n\nCleaning and disinfection\n\nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (e.g., playground equipment, door handles, sink handles, drinking fountains) within the school and on school buses at least daily or between use as much as possible. Use of shared objects (e.g., gym or physical education equipment, art supplies, toys, games) should be limited when possible, or cleaned between use.\nDevelop a schedule for increased frequency of routine cleaning and disinfection.\nIf transport vehicles (e.g., buses) are used by the school, drivers should practice all safety actions and protocols as indicated for other staff (e.g., hand hygiene, masks). To clean and disinfect school buses or other transport vehicles, see guidance for bus transit operators.\nDevelop a schedule for increased, routine cleaning and disinfection.\nEnsure safe and correct use and storage of cleaning and disinfection productsexternal icon, including storing products securely away from children. Use products that meet EPA disinfection criteriaexternal icon.\nCleaning products should not be used near children, and staff should ensure that there is adequate ventilation when using these products to prevent children or themselves from inhaling toxic fumes.\nShared objects\n\nDiscourage sharing of items that are difficult to clean or disinfect.\nKeep each child\u2019s belongings separated from others\u2019 and in individually labeled containers, cubbies, or areas.\nEnsure adequate supplies to minimize sharing of high touch materials to the extent possible (e.g., assigning each student their own art supplies, equipment) or limit use of supplies and equipment by one group of children at a time and clean and disinfect between use.\nAvoid sharing electronic devices, toys, books, and other games or learning aids.\nVentilation\n\nConsider ventilation system upgrades or improvements and other steps to increase the delivery of clean air and dilute potential contaminants in the school. Obtain consultation from experienced Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) professionals when considering changes to HVAC systems and equipment.  Some of the recommendations below are based on the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Guidance for Building Operations During the COVID-19 Pandemicexternal icon. Review additional ASHRAE guidelines for schools and universitiespdf iconexternal icon for further information on ventilation recommendations for different types of buildings and building readiness for occupancy. Not all steps are applicable for all scenarios.\n\nImprovement steps may include some or all of the following activities:\n\nIncrease outdoor air ventilation, using caution in highly polluted areas.\nWhen weather conditions allow, increase fresh outdoor air by opening windows and doors. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk (e.g., risk of falling, triggering asthma symptoms) to children using the facility.\nUse fans to increase the effectiveness of open windows.  Position fans securely and carefully in or near windows so as not to induce potentially contaminated airflow directly from one person over another (strategic window fan placement in exhaust mode can help draw fresh air into room via other open windows and doors without generating strong room air currents).\nDecrease occupancy in areas where outdoor ventilation cannot be increased.\nEnsure ventilation systems operate properly and provide acceptable indoor air quality for the current occupancy level for each space.\nIncrease total airflow supply to occupied spaces, when possible.\nDisable demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) controls that reduce air supply based on occupancy or temperature during occupied hours.\nFurther open minimum outdoor air dampers to reduce or eliminate HVAC air recirculation. In mild weather, this will not affect thermal comfort or humidity. However, this may be difficult to do in cold, hot, or humid weather.\nImprove central air filtration:\nIncrease air filtrationexternal icon to as high as possible without significantly diminishing design airflow.\nInspect filter housing and racks to ensure appropriate filter fit and check for ways to minimize filter bypass\nCheck filters to ensure they are within service life and appropriately installed.\nConsider running the HVAC system at maximum outside airflow for 2 hours before and after the school is occupied.\nEnsure restroom exhaust fans are functional and operating at full capacity when the school is occupied.\nInspect and maintain local exhaust ventilation in areas such as restrooms, kitchens, cooking areas, etc.\nUse portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) fan/filtration systems to help enhance air cleaning (especially in higher risk areas such as the nurse\u2019s office).\nInspect and maintain local exhaust ventilation in areas such as bathrooms, kitchens, cooking areas, etc.\nUse portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) fan/filtration systems to help enhance air cleaning (especially in higher risk areas such as nurse\u2019s office and special education classrooms).\nGenerate clean-to-less-clean air movement by re-evaluating the positioning of supply and exhaust air diffusers and/or dampers (especially in higher risk areas such as the nurse\u2019s office).\nConsider using ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) as a supplement to help inactivate SARS-CoV-2, especially if options for increasing room ventilation are limited.\nVentilation considerations are also important on school buses.\n*Note: The ventilation intervention considerations listed above come with a range of initial costs and operating costs which, along with risk assessment parameters such as community incidence rates, facemask compliance expectations and classroom density, may affect considerations for which interventions are implemented.  Acquisition cost estimates (per room) for the listed ventilation interventions range from $0.00 (opening a window; inspecting and maintain local exhaust ventilation; disabling DCV controls; or repositioning outdoor air dampers) to <$100 (using fans to increase effectiveness of open windows; or repositioning supply/exhaust diffusers to create directional airflow) to approx. $500 (adding portable HEPA fan/filter systems) to approx. $1500 (adding upper room UVGI).\n\nWater systems\n\nThe temporary shutdown or reduced operation of schools and reductions in normal water use can create hazards for returning students and staff. To minimize the risk of lead or copper exposure, Legionnaire\u2019s disease, and other diseases associated with water, take steps such as plumbing flushing to ensure that all water systems and features (e.g., sink faucets, drinking fountains, showers, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown, and follow EPA\u2019s 3Ts, (Training, Testing, and Taking Action) for reducing lead in drinking waterexternal icon. It may be necessary to conduct ongoing regular flushing after reopening. For additional resources, refer to EPA\u2019s Information on Maintaining or Restoring Water Quality in Buildings with Low or No Useexternal icon. Drinking fountains should be cleaned and sanitized.\n\nModified layouts\n\nSpace seating/desks at least 6 feet apart when feasible.\nTurn desks to face in the same direction (rather than facing each other), or have students sit on only one side of tables, spaced apart.\nModify learning stations and activities as applicable so there are fewer students per group, placed at least 6 feet apart if possible.\nCreate distance between children on school buses (g., seat children one child per row, skip rows) when possible.\nPhysical barriers and guides\n\nInstall physical barriers, such as sneeze guards and partitions, particularly in areas where it is difficult for individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart (e.g., reception desks).\nProvide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls, to ensure that staff and children remain at least 6 feet apart in lines and at other times (e.g. guides for creating \u201cone way routes\u201d in hallways).\nCommunal spaces\n\nClose communal use shared spaces such as dining halls and playgrounds with shared playground equipment if possible; otherwise, stagger use and clean and disinfect between use.\nAdd physical barriers, such as plastic flexible screens, between bathroom sinks especially when they cannot be at least 6 feet apart.\nFood service\n\nSchools are essential to meeting the nutritional needs of children with many consuming up to half their daily calories at school. Nationwide more than 30 million children participate in the National School Lunch Program and nearly 15 million participate in the School Breakfast Program. (15, 16) There are several mitigation strategies that schools may implement while providing this critical service to their students.\nAvoid offering any self-serve food or drink options, such as hot and cold food bars, salad or condiment bars, and drink stations. Serve individually plated or pre-packaged meals instead, while ensuring the safety of children with food allergiespdf icon.\nAs feasible, have children eat meals outdoors or in classrooms, while maintaining social distance (at least 6 feet apart) as much as possible, instead of in a communal dining hall or cafeteria.\nHave teachers and children wash their hands with soap and water for 20 seconds or use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol before and after eating. Ensure children do not share food, either brought from home or from the food service.\nIf communal dining halls or cafeterias will be used, ensure that children remain at least 6 feet apart in food service lines and at tables while eating. Clean and disinfect tables and chairs between each use.\nEnsure children do not share food or utensils. This helps prevent the spread of COVID-19 for all students and helps ensure the safety of children with food allergiespdf icon:\nUse disposable food service items (e.g., utensils, trays).\nIf disposable items are not feasible or desirable, ensure that all non-disposable food service items and equipment are handled by staff with gloves and washed with dish soap and hot water or in a dishwasher.\nIndividuals should wash their hands after removing their gloves or after directly handling used food service items.\nIf food is offered at any event, have pre-packaged boxes or bags for each attendee instead of a buffet or family-style meal.\nProvide tissues and no-touch or foot pedal trash cans, where possible, for employees, volunteers, and students to use.\nIf possible, install touchless payment methods (pay without touching money, a card, or a keypad). Provide hand sanitizer right after handling money, cards, or keypads.\nOf Note: USDA has issued the COVID-19 Nationwide Waiver to Allow Meal Pattern Flexibility in the Child Nutrition Programsexternal icon. Maintaining healthy operations\n\nSchools may consider implementing several strategies to maintain healthy operations.\n\nProtections for staff and children at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19\n\nOffer options for staff at higher risk for severe illness (including older adults and people of all ages with certain underlying medical conditions or disabilities) that limit their exposure risk (e.g., telework, modified job responsibilities that limit exposure risk).\nOffer options for students at higher risk of severe illness that limit their exposure risk (e.g., virtual learning opportunities).\nProvide inclusive programming for children and youth with special healthcare needs and disabilities that allows on-site or virtual participation with appropriate accommodations, modifications, and assistance (e.g., students with disabilities may have more difficulties accessing and using technology for virtual learning).\nConsistent with applicable law, put in place policies to protect the privacy of people at higher risk for severe illness regarding underlying medical conditions.\nRegulatory awareness\n\nBe aware of local or state regulatory agency policies related to group gatherings to determine if events can be held.\n\nIdentifying small groups and keeping them together (cohorting or podding)\n\nDividing students and teachers into distinct groups that stay together throughout an entire school day during in-person classroom instruction. Limit mixing between groups such that there is minimal or no interaction between cohorts.\n\nAlternating schedule\n\nAlternate the days when cohorts physically attend school. For example, certain grades or classrooms physically attend school on Monday/Tuesday and other grades or classrooms physically attend on Thursday/Friday (and the school is thoroughly cleaned in between, on Wednesday). As another example, some schools internationally have rotated in-person attendance weekly with one group of students attending during a week, followed by a different group the next week in rotation with thorough cleaning on the weekends.\n\nStaggered scheduling\n\nStagger student arrival, drop-off, and pick-up time or locations by cohort, or put in place other protocols to limit contact between cohorts and direct contact with parents, guardians, and caregivers as much as possible.\nWhen possible, use flexible worksites (e.g., telework at home) and flexible work hours (e.g., staggered shifts) to help establish policies and practices for social distancing (staying at least 6 feet apart).\nMix of virtual learning and in-class learning (hybrid schedule)\n\nHybrid options can apply a cohort approach to the in-class education provided.\n\nVirtual/at-home only\n\nStudents and teachers engage in virtual-only classes, activities, and events.\n\nGatherings, visitors, and field trips\n\nPursue virtual group events, gatherings, or meetings, if possible, and promote social distancing of at least 6 feet between people if events are held. Limit group size to the extent possible.\nPursue options to convene sporting events and participate in sports activities in ways that reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to players, families, coaches, and communities.\nLimit any nonessential visitors, volunteers, and activities involving external groups or organizations as possible \u2013 especially with individuals who are not from the local geographic area (e.g., community, town, city, county).\nLimit cross-school transfer for special programs. For example, if students are brought from multiple schools for special programs (e.g., music, robotics, academic clubs, sports), consider using distance learning and virtual environments to deliver the instruction or temporarily offering duplicate programs in the participating schools.  For youth sports considerations visit the FAQs for Youth Sports Programs (e.g., physical distance, wearing masks, etc.).\nDevelop a plan for staff who travel between schools (e.g., school nurses, psychologists, therapists). For example, consider allowing them to have virtual meetings in place of physical school visits and revise scheduling to limit their visits to multiple campuses.\nPursue virtual activities and events in lieu of field trips, student assemblies, special performances, school-wide parent meetings, and spirit nights, as possible.\nDesignated COVID-19 point of contact\n\nDesignate a staff person, such as the school nurse, to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns. All school staff and families should know who this person is and how to contact them.\n\nTravel and transit\n\nConsider options for limiting non-essential travel in accordance with state and local regulations and guidance.\nConsider postponing or canceling upcoming student international travel programs.\nEncourage students, faculty and staff who use public transportation or ride sharing to use forms of transportation that minimize close contact with others (e.g., biking, walking, driving or riding by car either alone or with household members).\nEnsure options for safe travel on campus for people with disabilities. For example, social distancing in designated seating areas for wheelchairs may not be possible and drivers who may need to have close contact to assist a person with disabilities.\nEncourage students, faculty and staff who use public transportation or ride sharing to follow CDC guidance on how to protect yourself when using Additionally, encourage them to commute during less busy times and clean their hands as soon as possible after their trip.\nParticipation in community response efforts\n\nConsider participating with local authorities in broader COVID-19 community response efforts (e.g., sitting on community response committees).\n\nCommunication systems\n\nPut systems in place for:\n\nStaff and families should self-report to the school if they or their student have symptoms of COVID-19, a positive test for COVID-19, or were exposed to someone with COVID-19 within the last 14 days. The reporting system should be consistent with the health information sharing regulations for COVID-19external icon (e.g. see \u201cNotify Health Officials and Close Contacts\u201d in the Preparing for When Someone Gets Sick section below) and other applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and confidentiality, such as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). The communication methods should be accessible for all students, faculty and staff, including those with disabilities and limited English proficiency (e.g., use interpreters and translated materials)\nNotifying staff, families, and the public of school closures and any restrictions in place to limit COVID-19 exposure (e.g., limited hours of operation).\nLeave (time off) policies and excused absence policies\n\nImplement flexible sick leave policies and practices that enable staff to stay home when they are sick, have been exposed, or caring for someone who is sick.\nExamine and revise policies for leave, telework, and employee compensation.\nLeave policies should be flexible and not punish people for taking time off and should allow sick employees to stay home and away from co-workers. Leave policies should also account for employees who need to stay home with their children if there are school or childcare closures, or to care for sick family members.  Additional flexibilities might include giving advances on future sick leave days and allowing employees to donate sick leave to each other, for example.\nDevelop policies for return-to-school after COVID-19 illness. CDC\u2019s criteria to discontinue home isolation and quarantine can inform these policies.\nBack-up staffing plan\n\nMonitor absenteeism of students and employees, cross-train staff, and create a roster of trained back-up staff.\n\nStaff training\n\nTrain staff on all safety protocols.\nConduct training virtually or ensure that social distancing is maintained during training.\nRecognize signs and symptoms\n\nWe learn more about COVID-19 every day, and as more information becomes available, CDC will continue to update and share information. As our knowledge and understanding of COVID-19 evolves, this guidance may change.\n\nBased on the best available evidence at this time:\n\nCDC does not currently recommend universal symptom screenings (screening all students grades K-12) be conducted by schools.\nParents or caregivers should be strongly encouraged to monitor their children for signs of infectious illness including COVID-19 every day.\nStudents who have symptoms of any infectious illness or symptoms consistent with COVID-19 should not attend school in-person.\nThe profile of symptoms associated with COVID-19 remains under study and will be updated as warranted by research findings. Further information on what symptoms may suggest infectious illness and recommended return-to-school policies is available at Screening K-12 Students for Symptoms of COVID-19: Limitations and Considerations.\nSchools that choose to conduct symptom screening should conduct these screenings safely and respectfully, and in accordance with any applicable privacy laws and regulations (e.g., confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act [FERPA]).\nThe considerations detailed here are intended only for students in K-12 school settings. For guidance related to screening of staff, please refer to CDC\u2019s Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers Responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 and the Prevent Transmission Among Employees section of CDC\u2019s Resuming Business Toolkitpdf icon.\nSharing facilities\n\nEncourage any organizations that share or use the school facilities to also follow these considerations.\n\nSupport coping and resilience \n\nEncourage employees and students to take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories about COVID-19, including social media if they are feeling overwhelmed or distressed.\nPromote employees and students eating healthy, exercising, getting sleep, and finding time to unwind.\nEncourage employees and students to talk with people they trust about their concerns and how they are feeling.\nTransparently communicate with staff, teachers, students, and families, including about mental health support services available at the school. These critical communications should be accessible to individuals with disabilities and limited English proficiency.\nShare facts about COVID-19 regularly through trusted sources of information to counter the spread of misinformation and mitigate fear.\nConsider posting signages for the national distress hotline: 1-800-985-5990, or text TalkWithUsto 66746\nEnsure continuity of mental health services, such as offering remote counseling.\nEncourage students to call 911 or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255), 1-888-628-9454 for Spanish, or Lifeline Crisis Chatexternal icon if they are feeling overwhelmed with emotions such as sadness, depression, anxiety, or feel like wanting to harm themselves or others. Prepare for when someone is sick with COVID-19\n\nSchools may consider implementing several strategies to prepare for when someone is sick with COVID-19.\n\nAdvise staff and families of students sick with COVID-19 of home isolation criteria\n\nSick staff members or students should not return until they have met CDC\u2019s criteria to discontinue home isolation.\n\nMake sure that staff and families know when they should stay home\n\nMake sure that staff and families know that they (staff) or their children (families) should not come to school, and that they should notify school officials (e.g., the designated COVID-19 point of contact [e.g., school nurse]) if they (staff) or their child (families) test positive for COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 symptoms or a confirmed or suspected case. These critical communications should be accessible to individuals with disabilities and limited English proficiency.\n\nIsolate and transport students who develop symptoms while at school\n\nSome students may develop symptoms of infectious illness while at school. Schools should take action to isolate students who develop these symptoms from other students and staff. Follow the school isolation protocol outlined in Screening K-12 Students for Symptoms of COVID-19: Limitations and Considerations when student develops symptoms of an infectious illness.\n\nClean and disinfect\n\nClose off areas used by a sick person and do not use these areas until after cleaning and disinfecting them. For outdoor areas (e.g., playgrounds, sitting areas, outdoor eating areas, etc.), this includes surfaces or shared objects in the area, if applicable.\nWait at least 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible. Ensure safe and correct use and storage of cleaning and disinfection productsexternal icon, including storing products securely away from children.\nNotify health officials and close contacts\n\nIn accordance with state and local laws and regulations, school administrators should notify local health officials, staff, and families immediately of any case of COVID-19 while maintaining confidentiality in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)external icon and FERPAexternal icon or and other applicable laws and regulations.\nInform those who have had close contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19 to stay home and self-monitor for symptoms, and follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop. Maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)external icon and Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) or and other applicable laws and regulations.\nA school might need to implement short-term building closure procedures if/when an infected person has been on campus during their infectious period and has close contact with others. If this happens, work with local public health officials to determine next steps. One option is an initial short-term class suspension and cancellation of events and activities (e.g., assemblies, spirit nights, field trips, and sporting events) to allow time for local health officials to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation and help the school determine appropriate next steps, including whether such a suspension needs to be extended to stop or slow further spread of COVID-19.  In situations where schools are cohorting students (e.g., in pods) administrators may choose to close the building in places (e.g., classrooms, common areas) where others were exposed to the infected person. In the event that local health officials do not recommend building or classroom closures, thoroughly cleaning the areas where the infected person spent significant time should be considered.\nLocal health officials\u2019 recommendations whether to suspend school or events and the duration such suspensions should be made on a case-by-case basis using the most up-to-date information about COVID-19 and taking into account local case-counts, and the degree of ongoing transmission in the community.",

            "Text": "Who this is for: This information is intended for use by employers and employees in retail, services, and other customer-based businesses. Retail or service businesses sell goods and provide services to the public and include department stores, grocery stores, gas stations, and restaurants. These businesses are open and have started state-directed, municipality-directed, and company-directed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention policies and practices to minimize the spread of the virus among employees and customers.\n\nThis information is not intended to address every business setting. A business may need to adapt these strategies based on its physical space, staffing, and other factors.\n\nPurpose: This webpage offers strategies to limit violence towards workers that may occur when businesses put in place policies and practices to help minimize the spread of COVID-19 among employees and customers. These policies may include requiring masks to be worn by employees and customers, asking customers to follow social distancing rules, and setting limits on the number of customers allowed in a business facility at one time.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may update this page periodically. Please check the CDC COVID-19 website regularly for updated guidance.\n\nPlease check the CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers Responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) for general business guidance on preventing COVID-19.\n\nWorkplace violence is \u201cviolent acts, including physical assaults and threats of assault, directed toward persons at work or on duty.\u201d Workplace violence includes\n\nThreat: verbal, written, and physical expressions that could reasonably be interpreted as intending to cause harm.\nVerbal assault: yelling, swearing, insulting, or bullying another person with the intent of hurting or causing harm. Unlike physical assaults, the intent is not necessarily to cause physical harm, but negative emotions of the person being assaulted.\nPhysical assault: hitting, slapping, kicking, pushing, choking, grabbing, or other physical contact with the intent of causing injury or harm.\nConflict resolution is the process of finding a peaceful end to a conflict or argument.\n\nA nonviolent response is a peaceful approach to address a situation in which a person is aggressive or threatening. This technique involves remaining calm, giving a person space, making sure other people are in the area, and not touching the person or trying to forcibly remove them.\n\nWorkplace violence and COVID-19\nWorkers may be threatened and assaulted as businesses try to put into place COVID-19 prevention policies and practices (e.g., mandatory use of masks, social distancing, and limits on the number of customers allowed in a business). These threats and assaults can come from customers, other employees, or employers. Based on a 1996 Current Intelligence Bulletin, threats and assaults can happen in any workplace, but may be more likely to occur in retail, services (e.g., restaurants), and other customer- or client-based businesses.\n\nResources and Trainings on Workplace Violence\nEmployers and employees can use the following resources and trainings to learn more about how to prevent and deal with workplace violence:\n\nFAA Workplace Violence Prevention and Responsepdf iconexternal icon\nFBI Workplace Violence: Issues in Responseexternal icon\nNIOSH Occupational Violence\nOSHA Recommendations for Workplace Violence Prevention Programs in Late-Night Retail Establishmentspdf iconexternal icon\nEmployers can take action to prevent workplace violence Offer customers options to minimize their contact with others and promote social distancing. These options can include curbside pick-up; personal shoppers; home delivery for groceries, food, and other services; and alternative shopping hours. Post signs that let customers know about policies for wearing masks, social distancing, and the maximum number of people allowed in a business facility. Advertise COVID-19-related policies on the business website. Provide employee training on threat recognition, conflict resolution, nonviolent response, and on any other relevant topics related to workplace violence response. Put in place steps to assess and respond to workplace violence. Response will depend on the severity of the violence and on the size and structure of the business. Possible responses may include reporting to a manager or supervisor on-duty, calling security, or calling 911. Remain aware of and support employees and customers if a threatening or violent situation occurs. Assign two workers to work as a team to encourage COVID-19 prevention policies be followed, if staffing permits.

A business may need to adapt these strategies based on its physical space, staffing, and other factors.\n\nPurpose: This webpage offers strategies to limit violence towards workers that may occur when businesses put in place policies and practices to help minimize the spread of COVID-19 among employees and customers. These policies may include requiring masks to be worn by employees and customers, asking customers to follow social distancing rules, and setting limits on the number of customers allowed in a business facility at one time.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may update this page periodically. Please check the CDC COVID-19 website regularly for updated guidance.\n\nPlease check the CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers Responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) for general business guidance on preventing COVID-19.\n\nWorkplace violence is \u201cviolent acts, including physical assaults and threats of assault, directed toward persons at work or on duty.\u201d Workplace violence includes\n\nThreat: verbal, written, and physical expressions that could reasonably be interpreted as intending to cause harm.\nVerbal assault: yelling, swearing, insulting, or bullying another person with the intent of hurting or causing harm. Unlike physical assaults, the intent is not necessarily to cause physical harm, but negative emotions of the person being assaulted.\nPhysical assault: hitting, slapping, kicking, pushing, choking, grabbing, or other physical contact with the intent of causing injury or harm.\nConflict resolution is the process of finding a peaceful end to a conflict or argument.\n\nA nonviolent response is a peaceful approach to address a situation in which a person is aggressive or threatening. This technique involves remaining calm, giving a person space, making sure other people are in the area, and not touching the person or trying to forcibly remove them.\n\nWorkplace violence and COVID-19\nWorkers may be threatened and assaulted as businesses try to put into place COVID-19 prevention policies and practices (e.g., mandatory use of masks, social distancing, and limits on the number of customers allowed in a business). These threats and assaults can come from customers, other employees, or employers. Based on a 1996 Current Intelligence Bulletin, threats and assaults can happen in any workplace, but may be more likely to occur in retail, services (e.g., restaurants), and other customer- or client-based businesses.\n\nResources and Trainings on Workplace Violence\nEmployers and employees can use the following resources and trainings to learn more about how to prevent and deal with workplace violence:\n\nFAA Workplace Violence Prevention and Responsepdf iconexternal icon\nFBI Workplace Violence: Issues in Responseexternal icon\nNIOSH Occupational Violence\nOSHA Recommendations for Workplace Violence Prevention Programs in Late-Night Retail Establishmentspdf iconexternal icon\nEmployers can take action to prevent workplace violence Offer customers options to minimize their contact with others and promote social distancing. These options can include curbside pick-up; personal shoppers; home delivery for groceries, food, and other services; and alternative shopping hours. Post signs that let customers know about policies for wearing masks, social distancing, and the maximum number of people allowed in a business facility. Advertise COVID-19-related policies on the business website.

            "HeadLine": "As students return, the deaths of at least six teachers from covid-19 renew pandemic fears",
            "Text": "Teachers had just returned last month to prepare for the fall semester at John Evans Middle School in Potosi, Mo., when 34-year-old AshLee DeMarinis started to feel ill.\n\nDeMarinis had been worried about returning to work at the rural middle school, where she was starting her 11th year of teaching. She had asthma, which put her at a higher risk for complications from covid-19 despite her young age.\n\n\u201cShe was scared,\u201d her sister, Jennifer Heissenbuttel, told The Washington Post.\n\nThree weeks later, DeMarinis died in the hospital after testing positive for the novel coronavirus and suffering from complications caused by the infection.\n\nDeMarinis isn\u2019t the only teacher to die amid the pandemic as children return to schools across the United States. Educators in Missouri, Mississippi, South Carolina, Iowa and Oklahoma have died as the fall semester started in their districts. It isn\u2019t clear whether any of the teachers were infected at school, and many quarantined to avoid exposing students and other staff members. But their deaths have renewed fears that school campuses will become a breeding ground for the virus, spreading the illness as communities grapple with how to balance the need to educate children with properly addressing the pandemic. School districts and state officials have struggled to find the right coronavirus precautions. In Georgia, one school district was forced to send hundreds of people home to quarantine after just one day of school prep on campus. Another district in that state ordered 900 children and staff to quarantine after being exposed to the virus during the first week back in class.\n\nA Georgia district returned to school last week. More than 900 students and staff are now quarantined.\n\nDeMarinis was an avid crafter who spent her summer at a lake with her sister and her nieces. When she returned to school on Aug. 10, she was concerned about the pandemic, her sister told The Post, but she got to work readying the classroom for her students who were set to start classes in a few weeks.\n\n\u201cShe taught special education, and it was just her calling,\u201d her sister said. \u201cHer students loved her and her colleagues loved her.\u201d DeMarinis initially thought she had an ear infection when she started to feel sick on Aug. 14. But her condition worsened quickly, and by Aug. 19 she tested positive for coronavirus. She died on Sunday after three weeks on a ventilator at the hospital.\n\nNationally, at least five other teachers have died since early August.\n\nThis week, Demetria \u201cDemi\u201d Bannister, a 28-year-old third-grade teacher in Columbia, S.C., died from complications of the coronavirus, the State reported. On Sunday, Tom Slade, a 53-year-old high school history teacher in Vancleave, Miss., died of the virus, the Sun Herald reported.\n\nNacoma James, 42, a beloved football coach in Oxford, Miss., died in early August during the first week back on campus for his students. He spent the summer coaching at football practices until he was forced to self-quarantine after developing coronavirus-like symptoms, Mississippi Today reported. The deaths have disrupted the start of the fall semester for many schools, and left students mourning their favorite instructors and role models.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a gut punch really,\u201d one of Slade\u2019s students, Chase Hall, told WLOX. \u201cHe was a man I respected. I looked forward to him coming back to the classroom, and then he was gone.\u201d\n\nStay safe and informed with our free Coronavirus Updates newsletter\n\nSome districts have also been struggling to comply with quarantine requirements as staff and students test positive for the virus. Two days after children returned to classes in Tahlequah, Okla., school district officials confirmed special education teacher Teresa Horn, 62, died on Aug. 28 from a heart attack after testing positive for the coronavirus, KTUL reported.\n\n\u201cIt is with a heavy heart that I announce the passing of one of our teachers,\u201d Tahlequah Public Schools said in a statement. \u201cLosing a member of your family is never easy and in the current climate, it makes the situation even worse.\u201d Tahlequah Public Schools sent students home for two days of virtual classes following Horn\u2019s death. In a little over a week since, the district has reported at least eight students and staff members have tested positive and dozens have been forced to quarantine after possible exposure to the virus at school.\n\nEven in districts that have committed to virtual classes, keeping kids off-campus is no guarantee the virus won\u2019t spread among staff members.\n\nA week before virtual classes were set to start in Des Moines, a teacher died after testing positive for the virus, sparking additional fears in a district that has been battling with state leaders over a statewide mandate requiring at least 50 percent of classes to involve in-person instruction.\n\n\u201cThis death has shook many teachers in the district to our cores and underscores the importance of our district having the authority to keep our students, staff and community safe based on local health conditions,\u201d Josh Brown, president of the Des Moines Education Association, told the Des Moines Register.",

            "HeadLine": "What explains surge in coronavirus numbers in India?",
            "Text": "New Delhi, India - India has added another 300,000 coronavirus infections to its caseload in the past four days, an infection rate which could see it overtake the United States to become the world's worst-affected country within weeks.\n\nThe country registered 96,551 new cases - a fresh global record - on Friday.\n\nOn Monday, India had surpassed Brazil as the country with the second-highest number of coronavirus cases in the world, with 4.2 million cases. The US has a caseload of 6.4 million infections.\n\nMore than 76,000 people in India have died due to the coronavirus, which has killed more than 909,000 people worldwide. \n\nIndia's health ministry says the surge in cases is due to an increase in daily testing that has now exceeded one million.\n\nDespite the steep surge in new cases and deaths, India continues to ease restrictions and open up its economy to make up for losses incurred during its long and punishing lockdown period, which experts believe was rushed through and \"illogical\". The March lockdown forced hundreds of thousands of workers to flee cities for their homes, and experts say it probably contributed to the spread of the virus in rural areas.\n\nMoreover, they say that the government has not successfully communicated an effective and uniform message on masking, social distancing and congregation - measures that could have helped contain the spread of the outbreak.\n\nAs the infections spike in rural areas, health experts say the country's crumbling rural health sector is not equipped to deal with the surge in cases in the world's second-most populous nation.\n\nThe only silver lining for the government is the high recovery rate (77 percent) and the low mortality rate (1.6 percent) - points the government continues to emphasise.\n\nPoor health infrastructure\nEven in cities, patients have had to suffer due to poor hospital facilities and protocols. Mohinder Kaur, who was admitted to a government-run Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital in the capital, New Delhi, after testing COVID-19 positive, told Al Jazeera of her ordeal.\n\n\"No one would come near us or even help us. If anyone would accidentally touch us, the staff would shout at them for ruining a PPE (personal protective equipment) kit, the 75-year-old retired school teacher told Al Jazeera. \"In this heat, the fans were not working and the staff would not get them fixed despite several complaints. The toilets were filthy and sometimes had no water. The ward had rats, lizards, cats and even dogs roaming around. It was a living hell and we are fortunate to have survived this,\" she said.\n\nIndia's capital still has better health facilities in comparison to rural areas where only 20 percent of India's doctors and 40 percent of hospitals are located. Health experts feel that this could put millions of people at risk. \"India's epidemic is two-part, urban followed by rural, each consisting of innumerable outbreaks - each district or city/large town with its own outbreak, the sum total is what is seen in numbers,\" said Dr T Jacob John, epidemiologist and former professor at Christian Medical College, Vellore.\n\n\"In the last week of August, the epidemic reached all nooks and corners - evidenced by infection among tribal communities. That means, spatially the epidemic has peaked,\" he said.\n\nStage four of the pandemic\nJohn says India has entered stage four of the pandemic, which means the country is seeing widespread transmission, and that is reflected in the record number of daily infections in the past several weeks.\n\nBut the government has so far steadfastly denied community transmission, during which the source of contagion is not known. John says India witnessed community transmission (stage three) between March and July. The epidemiologist said authorities must move from the idea of \"control\" to \"mitigation\".\n\nPreeti Kumar, vice president, public health system support at the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), a public-private non-profit, pointed out that India is a federal state and health is largely a state subject.\n\n\"Each state has implemented the response based on the strength of its health system and available resources,\" Kumar told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"Kerala and Punjab states introduced lockdowns even before the rest of the country did. Four southern states (with stronger health systems) have also tested more and reported better.\n\n\"In contrast, the poorer northern states with weaker health systems, are only now beginning to feel the impact and are struggling with testing, tracing, treating and reporting,\" she said.\n\nAccording to Kumar, the Indian government provided much of the leadership in the early stage of the pandemic, and continues to support through strategic guidelines, expertise and some level of funding.\n\nIneffective lockdown Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government had introduced one of the world's strictest lockdowns, triggering a working-class exodus from cities to rural areas and smaller towns.\n\nThe two-month lockdown led to the shuttering of factories and loss of millions of jobs, and experts say the decision, taken at four hours' notice, was \"ineffective and unscientific\". \"The lockdown was wrong, it just destroyed our economy,\" said Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil, epidemiologist and chairperson of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the National Institute of Epidemiology.\n\nCalling it a rushed move, Christian Medical College's John said India's lockdown had no scientific support. \"National lockdown was illogical. It was necessary in different states at different times as they reached phase three,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Kumar of PHFI believes that other countries like South Korea, Japan, Thailand and Taiwan did not see the rise in cases the way India has seen post-lockdown because they had invested heavily in testing, contact-tracing and quarantine.\n\n\"Lockdown was declared to help buy time to prepare the system to cope - prepare facilities, equipment, consumables, testing labs, surveillance systems and health workforce,\" Kumar said. \"These countries also had widespread use of masks, distancing, etc. These interventions together helped flatten the curve. Our scale-up in testing has taken more time, starting from a very low base. Lastly, our public measures and awareness on masking, hygiene and distancing are very low.\"\n\nIn India, especially in rural areas and even semi-urban areas, poor hygiene standards and lack of social distancing measures further contributed to the spread of the virus, experts say.\n\n\"Poor sanitation is the government's failure,\" said John. Kumar from PHFI blamed the government for not successfully communicating an effective, uniform message on masking, distancing and congregating.\n\n\"Beyond the big metros, there is little information on wearing masks. I think the communication has not been sufficiently effective and sustained to spread awareness about it. Opening up is being perceived by people as if the epidemic is no more a threat. This incorrect perception needs to be addressed,\" she added.\n\nAccording to her, countries which have managed to flatten the curve have relied on the government to scale up testing, contact tracing and treatment. \"Alongside, they have effective policies on active public engagement on masking and distancing,\" she told Al Jazeera. India has conducted 54 million tests so far, compared with the US which has conducted more than 90 million tests. The US population is a quarter of India's 1.4 billion people.\n\nGoverning party spokesman defends gov't\nOn flattening the curve, John said, \"Mask-wearing and avoiding crowding, school closure etc has definitely flattened the curve a little bit, not as much as we could have achieved had we done lockdowns in a planned manner.\"\n\nThe only silver lining for India in its fight against the pandemic is its low mortality rate. Experts say the mortality rate is also low in neighbouring countries.\n\n\"Fortunately, COVID-19 mortality is quite low in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Median age in these countries is below 30 and that is one reason for the low mortality. Mortality is also declining globally - my hypothesis is that the virus is becoming less virulent, a natural phenomenon in new hosts and multiple generations of virus growth,\" said John.\n\nA spokesman from the BJP defended the Modi government's management of the pandemic.\n\n\"Those who are saying that lockdown was unscientific have wrong intentions,\" Bizay Sonkar Shastri, BJP's national spokesperson, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"It is because of lockdown that our daily numbers are at around 90,000, otherwise they would been in lakhs [hundred of thousands]. If lockdown was not enforced earlier, we would have been in an even worse position.\n\n\"Those who are raising questions about the lockdown are anti-Modi and anti-BJP,\" he said.",

            "HeadLine": "Coronavirus: Why are women paying a heavier price?",
            "Text": "Humanitarian crises can affect the lives of men and women differently - and the coronavirus pandemic is no exception.\n\nWomen have shown better COVID-19 outcomes than men - in part thanks to an additional X chromosome and sex hormones like oestrogen, which provoke better immune responses to the virus that causes COVID-19. But any such advantage is reversed when it comes to the social and economic effects of the pandemic; here the brunt falls heaviest on women.\n\n\"COVID-19 has had a devastating social and economic impact on women and girls, reversing decades of limited and fragile progress on gender equality,\" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned last week. \n\nSince governments around the world shut borders and slowed economic activities to curb the spread of the coronavirus, the global economy is expected to shrink by more than five percent in 2020 - this would be the worst recession since World War II.\n\nSuch economic hardship, though, reflects differently on men compared with women, who represent 39 percent of the global workforce but account for 54 percent of overall job losses. \n\n\"What has disproportionately affected women is insecurity and loss of employment because women tend to work in informal sectors with no financial protection or benefits,\" explained Avni Amin, a scientist working at the department of sexual and reproductive health and research on violence against women at the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nAs an example, more than 90 percent of the labour force in sub-Saharan Africa is composed of informal workers, most of whom are female, whose jobs are more at risk due to the pandemic, according to a World Bank report. Overall, women's work is 1.8 times more vulnerable than men's, according to data gathered by the management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. \n\n\"Women tend to work in informal sectors, so when the economy goes down, they are the first to lose their jobs,\" Amin said.\n\nThe risk is not just on the economic front. Women make up 70 percent (PDF) of the global health workforce and are highly represented on the front lines. As a result, they are more frequently exposed to infected patients. \n\nData gathered by UN Women shows that of all healthcare workers infected with COVID-19 in Spain and Italy, 72 percent and 66 percent respectively were women. When women can keep their jobs but have to work from home during the pandemic, new challenges arise; more hours of unpaid care work get added to a daily load already disproportionately carried by women. \n\nBefore the pandemic, women performed 76.2 percent of the total hours of unpaid care work, more than three times as much as men, according to the International Labour Organization. This percentage increased to 80 percent when looking at Asia and the Pacific. \n\nWhile they were forced to stay home during lockdowns, women in France, Germany and the United States spent significantly more time caring for children. In other cases, working mothers spent less time on paid work but more on household work. \n\n\"The impact [of the pandemic] on time scarcity for women has been large with implications on stress and mental health,\" said Amin, adding that women are bearing a \"triple burden\" of domestic and family responsibilities, caring for the sick, in addition to work. The advantages of a more gender-balanced recovery plan go beyond the wellbeing of women alone. \n\nIn a gender-regressive scenario in which no action is adopted to cushion the impact of these effects, McKinsey estimated that global gross domestic product growth could be $1 trillion lower in 2030 \"than it would be if women's unemployment simply tracked that of men in each sector\", its report read. As health system capacities are stretched, governments have to prioritise the provision of some health services, while reducing others. \n\n\"Looking at previous outbreaks, such as Ebola, one of the areas where governments tend to cut budgets from is sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning, maternal health services, access to safe abortion - with harmful consequences for women's health,\" said Amin.\n\nThe decrease in availability of sexual and reproductive health services can result in an increased risk of maternal mortality, unintended pregnancies and other adverse sexual and reproductive health outcomes among women and girls.\n\nThe Lancet Global Health journal published a study suggesting that a reduction in maternal health services of between just 9.8 percent to 18.5 percent could lead to as many as 12,200 additional maternal deaths over six months in low and middle-income countries. Violence against women\nAs people around the world were forced to stay home during lockdowns, emerging reports from several countries showed increased incidents of violence against women and girls, especially intimate partner violence, a recent study by UN Women found. In many cases, increased time spent at home with an abuser, the stress caused by uncertainty about the future, financial worries combined with the reduced access to support systems - such as friends, extended family and neighbours - can exacerbate existing tensions and conflicts. In Colombia, for example, reports of gender-based violence during lockdown increased by 175 percent compared with the previous year, according to Plan International.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, the violence service of the Ministry of Women's Affairs, L\u00ednea Mujer, received 619 calls during the first 25 days of quarantine.\n\n'Be mindful'\nSo, what can governments do to cushion the gendered impact of COVID-19?\n\nThe state of Hawaii has paved the way in showing what a post-recovery plan that addresses the impact on women and girls could look like. In its first Feminist Economic Recovery Plan, the island state prioritised spending not on infrastructure but on healthcare services. The plan includes maternal, sexual and reproductive healthcare services, on top of broader support for parents and caregivers. \"All the COVID and post-COVID recovery, emergency, preparedness and response plans really need to make sure health services for women, and services to respond to violence against women, are considered part of the essential package of services that are continued during and after COVID,\" Amin said.\n\nGovernments also need to make sure \"that social and financial protection is for those most likely to lose their jobs - and we know that by default these are women because they primarily work in informal sectors,\" she added.",

            "Text": "Progress in reducing child mortality, which fell to an all-time low in 2019, is at risk as the coronavirus pandemic disrupts health services and deprives mothers and young children of access to care, particularly in poor countries, the United Nations has warned.\n\nThe joint report by UN agencies, including the UN children's fund UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO), said preventable deaths among children under five dropped to 5.2 million in 2019 compared with 12.5 million in 1990, but the pandemic was \"putting millions of additional lives at stake\".\n\n\"The global community has come too far towards eliminating preventable child deaths to allow the COVID-19 pandemic to stop us in our tracks,\" said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF chief.\n\n\"When children are denied access to health services because the system is overrun, and when women are afraid to give birth at the hospital for fear of infection, they, too, may become casualties of COVID-19.\"\n\nFore called for \"urgent investments\" to resume disrupted health services, warning that millions of children were at risk without routine care. According to a study carried out by UNICEF in 77 countries, 68 percent faced interruption to health systems as a result of the pandemic, from vaccination programmes to medical visits for children, while 63 and 59 percent reported disruptions to ante-natal care and neo-natal care respectively. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the progress in reducing child mortality \"is proof of what is possible\" when countries make health a priority.\n\n\"We must not let the COVID-19 pandemic jeopardise this remarkable progress for our children and future generations\", he stressed.\n\n'Vast inequality'\nAnte- and neo-natal care in developing nations is relatively inexpensive and can profoundly affect child survival rates.\n\nFor example, women who receive care from professional midwives are 16 percent less likely to lose their baby and 24 percent less likely to experience pre-term birth, according to the WHO.\n\nThe survey found that seven countries had child mortality rates of more than 50 deaths in 1,000 live births last year. In Afghanistan, where 1 in 17 children die before their fifth birthday, the health ministry reported a \"significant reduction\" in visits to health facilities, UNICEF said.\n\nWhile that might be a result of fear of contracting COVID-19, avoiding healthcare facilities that have nothing to do with the coronavirus is a risk, experts say.\n\nMuhammad Ali Pate, global director for health, nutrition and population at the World Bank, says the pandemic is putting efforts to end preventable child deaths in \"serious jeopardy\".\n\n\"It is essential to protect life-saving services which have been key to reducing child mortality,\" he said.\n\nModelling conducted earlier this year by Johns Hopkins University found that almost 6,000 additional children could die every day if COVID-19 healthcare disruptions continued in the medium term.",

            "Text": "Reeling from the fallout of another crisis of his own creation, President Donald Trump was trying to move past revelations that he was determined to play down the threat of the coronavirus as he headed for a rally in the battleground state of Michigan on Thursday.\n\nBut the president was facing renewed pushback from local leaders worried that his rallies are growing in size and flouting public health guidelines intended to halt the spread of the virus. This week, the state of Nevada became the first to scuttle Trump's plans for rallies initially set for Las Vegas and Reno. Michigan's Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer has also raised alarms about Thursday's event.\n\nThe back-and-forth comes as the White House is grappling with fallout from a new book by Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward. In a series of interviews with Woodward, Trump spoke frankly about the dangers posed by the virus - even as he downplayed them publicly - and admitted he had tried to mislead the public. The book has refocused attention on Trump's handling of the virus, a subject he has tried to shift away from less than two months before the November 3 presidential election. In a tweet on Thursday morning, Trump defended his comments admitting that he had been warned about the danger of the virus.\n\n\"Bob Woodward had my quotes for many months,\" Trump wrote. \"If he thought they were so bad or dangerous, why didn't he immediately report them in an effort to save lives? Didn't he have an obligation to do so? No, because he knew they were good and proper answers. Calm, no panic!\"\n\nWoodward has defended his decision to hold off by saying he needed time to make sure Trump's private comments were true.\n\n\nAD\n\n\"I wanted to always play it down,\" Trump told Woodward on March 19, days after he declared a national emergency. \"I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic.\"\n\nCNN on Wednesday broadcast interviews Woodward did with Trump for his new book, Rage, which is due to go on sale next Tuesday.\n\nThe Republican president, assailed by his Democratic rival Joe Biden about the US government response to the coronavirus, played down the crisis for months as it took hold and spread across the country.\n\nIn the March 19 conversation, Trump told Woodward that some \"startling facts\" had emerged showing the extent of those at risk: \"It's not just old, older. Young people too, plenty of young people.\"\n\nIn taped conversations released along with the excerpts, Trump insisted he did not want to create \"panic\". But his comments also raised fresh questions about how he has managed the defining crisis of his presidency, one that has killed about 190,000 Americans so far, with no end in sight. \"The fact is, I'm a cheerleader for this country. I love our country and I don't want people to be frightened,\" Trump said at the White House. \"We've done well from any standard.\" According to the interviews, CNN and The Washington Post reported, Trump knew the virus was dangerous in early February.\n\n\"It goes through the air,\" Trump said in a recording of a February 7 interview with Woodward. \"That's always tougher than the touch. You don't have to touch things. Right? But the air, you just breathe the air and that's how it's passed.\n\n\"And so that's a very tricky one. That's a very delicate one. It's also more deadly than even your strenuous flus.\"\n\nA week after that interview, Trump said at a White House briefing that the number of US coronavirus cases \"within a couple days is going to be down close to zero.\"\n\nWoodward in an interview with The Associated Press news agency defended himself from online critics who questioned why he kept Trump's comments to himself for months as a pandemic raged.\n\n\"He tells me this, and I'm thinking, 'Wow, that's interesting, but is it true?' Trump says things that don't check out, right?\" the news agency quoted Woodward as saying in a phone interview. Some fellow Republicans defended Trump's coronavirus response on Wednesday.\n\n\"His actions of shutting the economy down were the right actions,\" Senator Lindsey Graham said. \"And I think the tone during that time sort of spoke for itself.\"\n\nWoodward conducted 18 interviews with Trump for the book. Other revelations include Trump's disparaging remarks about US military leaders. He drew criticism this week following reports that he had denigrated fallen military personnel and veterans.\n\nIn Woodward's book, an aide to former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis heard Trump say in a meeting, \"my f***ing generals are a bunch of p**sies\" because they cared more about alliances than trade deals. Mattis asked the aide to document the comment in an email, the Washington Post reported. Regarding the Black Lives Matter movement, Woodward asked Trump his views on the concept of white privilege and whether he felt isolated by that privilege from the plight of Black Americans.\n\n\"No. You really drank the Kool-Aid, didn't you? Just listen to you,\" Trump replied, according to media reports on the book. \"Wow. No, I don't feel that at all.\"\n\nRevelations from the Woodward book emerged just as Trump's campaign was beginning to feel that the virus was receding from public view. The president himself has been thumbing his nose at public health experts' warning against the sort of large gatherings - with few people wearing masks - that his campaign has been staging around the country.\n\nFor all of that, Trump has faced devastating revelations of his own creation before and survived them. They stretch back to his 2015 comments questioning the heroism of Senator John McCain, a decorated Vietnam prisoner of war, and the notorious Access Hollywood tape that emerged just before the 2016 election in which Trump described sexually assaulting women.",

They said they still held out hope for negotiations to produce a compromise, but some senators expressed doubts that would happen before the November 3 presidential and congressional elections.\n\nSo far, the coronavirus has led to the deaths of nearly 191,000 people in the US and more than 900,000 globally. Congress is now expected to mainly focus on work on other pressing legislation so members can return to their home states in October to campaign for re-election.\n\nEarlier this year, Congress quickly passed four important bills providing about $3 trillion to respond to the COVID-19 crisis.

            "Text": "AstraZeneca has \"voluntarily paused\" late-stage trials of the highly-anticipated COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with the University of Oxford after one of the study volunteers developed an unexplained illness, the company said on Wednesday.\n\nThe AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine is seen as one of the most promising of coronavirus vaccine candidates currently under development.\n\n\"As part of the ongoing randomized, controlled global trials of the Oxford coronavirus vaccine, our standard review process was triggered and we voluntarily paused vaccination to allow review of safety data by an independent committee,\" said Michele Meixell, the company's spokeswoman.\n\n\"This is a routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials, while it is investigated, ensuring we maintain the integrity of the trials.\"\n\nHealth news website Stat News earlier reported that the trial would be suspended because a volunteer had suffered a severe adverse reaction to the drug. \n\nAstraZeneca said that in large trials, illnesses sometimes occur in participants by chance, but that the issue had to be reviewed independently.\n\n\"We are working to expedite the review of the single event to minimise any potential impact on the trial timeline,\" Meixell said.\n\nThe drug is in trials involving thousands of people in the United States, Brazil, South Africa and the UK, where the patient who fell ill is. Julie Fischer, an associate research professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University, told Al Jazeera such a pause was \"part of the process\" of drug development and clinical trials.\n\n\"For a pause, the event would need to be serious; something related to the heart, lungs, kidneys or other part of the body's health system that required medical attention and was sufficiently serious to merit a pause to this very important vaccine trial in order to make sure it is safe, and that the adverse effect is not due to the vaccine itself.\"  \n\nFlorian Krammer, professor of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai said the fact a patient had fallen ill underscored the need for extensive trials.\n\n\"It shows you that the evaluation process works, and why we need Phase III trials,\" he wrote on Twitter. Clinical trial holds are not uncommon, but AstraZeneca's is the first phase-three COVID-19 vaccine trial known to have been put on hold. It is unclear how long the suspension might last and shares of the company fell more than 6 percent in after-hours trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The progress of the company's trial - and those of all COVID-19 vaccines in development - is being closely watched, given the pressing need for new ways to curb the global pandemic. There are currently nine vaccine candidates in Phase III trials.\n\nSafety protocols\nSeparately, nine leading US and European vaccine developers promised on Tuesday to uphold scientific standards in the global race to contain the pandemic.\n\nThe companies, including Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca, in a joint statement made a \"historic pledge ... to uphold the integrity of the scientific process as they work towards potential global regulatory filings and approvals of the first COVID-19 vaccines\".\n\nThe unusual move to promise to play by well-established rules underlines the highly politicised debate over what action is needed to rein in the spread of the disease. The head of the Food and Drug Administration, the US regulator, said last month that the normal approval process could be bypassed for a COVID-19 vaccine if officials were convinced the benefits outweighed the risks. The comments prompted a call for caution from the World Health Organization. Developers globally have yet to produce large-scale trial data showing actual infections in participants, but Russia approved a COVID-19 vaccine last month, prompting some Western experts to criticise a lack of testing.\n\nThe head of China's Sinovac Biotech said most of its employees and their families have already taken an experimental vaccine developed by the Chinese firm under the country's emergency-use programme.",

Others, like Liu Hewei, are not.\n\n\"A person's true death is when the whole world has forgotten them,\" said Taoist priest Liang Xingyang, who started the collection on January 29, shortly after Chinese authorities announced that the virus could pass between humans.\n\n\"No matter what religion or beliefs they hold, their spirit deserves to be passed on. In fact, they live on in our hearts,\" adding that Taoists use memorial tablets to give souls a place to rest after death.\n\nTaoism, or Daoism, is a philosophy-turned-religion that has tens of millions of followers in China and is one of the country's five officially sanctioned religions. The monastery complex, where a small community of priests lives, sleeps, eats and worships, is spread across a rocky hill. In a hall perched high up, reached by a steep flight of stairs, the ornate gold and blue slabs stand in neat rows.\n\nAn act of remembrance on such a scale is unusual in China - Liang believes his is the only such collection linked either to Taoism or Buddhism.\n\nChina, where the coronavirus was first recorded in the city of Wuhan late last year, has held remembrance events arranged by the government, and some museums have asked the public to donate items to commemorate the country's fight against COVID-19.\n\nAs of September 8, there have been 85,146 confirmed COVID-19 cases in mainland China, of whom 4,634 have died. Globally, more than 27 million people have been infected, more than 18 million recovered, and at least 897,000 people have died from COVID-19.\n\nOf those honoured by the tablets, only a minority died of COVID-19. Most died from other causes, like exhaustion from overwork, Liang said, adding that he compiled his list of \"heroes\" based on state media reports or government notices.\n\nLiu, for instance, was a 42-year-old government official from Inner Mongolia who died in February of a heart attack after working 20 days consecutively as a deputy director of a large local market. \"I think that enabling them to see each other in this way, enabling relatives to discover that after one of their family had lost their life, someone else remembers them, I think this is the greatest comfort to me,\" Liang explained.",

Typical aid budgets would not cover the costs, the UN chief added, urging donors to \"go deep\" into money set aside for combating coronavirus.\n\nThe spike in new infections, has prompted countries to tighten restrictions that had previously been relaxed. Portugal has limited gatherings to 10 people rather than 20 previously, and banned the sale of alcohol from 8pm, while the United Kingdom will impose a ban on gatherings involving more than six people from Monday.\n\nIn the Balearic Islands region of Spain, a popular holiday destination, 20,000 people in four areas of the Palma de Mallorca will be confined to their homes from Friday night except to go to work or school or seek medical care.\n\nThe French government will meet on Friday to consider new measures, and the possibility of smaller, local lockdowns.\n\n'Wake-up call'\nCOVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan in central China late last year and has now been diagnosed in nearly 28 million people around the world, leaving 906,195 people dead. The WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic in March.\n\nScientists have been working around the clock to develop better treatments for the virus, and a vaccine that would enable people to return to normal life. According to the WHO's latest overview, 35 candidate vaccines for the virus are being tested on humans, of which nine have reached phase three trials where they are tested on tens of thousands of people. This week, AstraZeneca, which is developing a vaccine with Oxford University, put its trials on hold after one of its volunteers in the UK developed neurological symptoms.\n\nSoumya Swaminathan, the agency's chief scientist, sought to reassure on Thursday.\n\n\"This is a wake-up call to recognise that there are ups and downs in clinical development and we have to be prepared,\" she said. \"We do not have to be discouraged. These things happen.\" A further 145 candidate vaccines are in earlier testing phases. Typically only about 10 percent of candidate vaccines succeed.\n\nWHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus hailed the speed at which vaccines, diagnostics and treatments were being developed but said more needed to be done.\n\n\"We need to rapidly scale up our clinical trials, manufacturing, licensing and regulation capacity so that these products can get to people and start saving lives,\" he said.\n\n\"Fully financing the ACT-Accelerator would shorten the pandemic and pay back this investment rapidly as the global economy recovers.\"",

            "Text": "US President Donald Trump knew the coronavirus was \"deadly\" and worse than the flu even as he intentionally misled the US public in February and March about the risks, according to a forthcoming book by American journalist Bob Woodward.\n\nTrump said in a recorded conversation with Woodward he has downplayed the risks of the coronavirus all along because he did not want to cause panic, according to a report in The Washington Post.\n\n\"You just breathe the air and that's how it's passed,\" Trump told Woodward in a February 7 telephone call.\n\n\"And so that's a very tricky one. That's a very delicate one. It's also more deadly than even your strenuous flu,\" Trump said.\n\n\"This is deadly stuff,\" the president repeated for emphasis, according to the report.\n\nTrump had learned in an intelligence briefing from his national security advisers on January 28 that the virus presented a serious threat, according to Woodward's book titled Rage and due out on September 15.\n\n\n\n\"This will be the biggest national security threat you face in your presidency,\" Robert O'Brien, the president's national security adviser, told Trump, according to Woodward, who did 18 one-on-one interviews with the president from December 2019 through July 2020.\n\n\"This is going to be the roughest thing you face,\" O'Brien told Trump.After repeated intelligence warnings, Trump downplayed the threat of the virus in public during February and did not sound a public alarm about the risk to the US.\n\n\"We pretty much shut it down coming in from China,\" Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity on February 2.\n\nCritics argue the president's slow response and failure to develop a national strategy to fight the virus has resulted in more deaths than necessary and continuing economic damage from the pandemic.\n\nThe US has suffered more than 190,000 deaths and recorded more than 6.3 million cases of COVID-19, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\n\nAD\nTrump's mishandling of the virus hurt him politically. Trump has fallen behind his Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden in public polls because voters see his response to the pandemic as inadequate.\n\n\"He knew how deadly it was. It was much more deadly than the flu. ... He knew and purposely played it down. Worse, he lied to the American people. He knowingly and willingly lied about the threat it posed to the country for months,\" Biden said during a campaign event in Warren, Michigan on Wednesday.\n\nHouse of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement: \"The president's own words spell out the devastating truth: Trump was fully aware of the catastrophic nature of the coronavirus but hid the facts and refused to take the threat seriously, leaving our entire country exposed and unprepared.\"\n\nNews of Woodward's audio recordings of the president went viral on Wednesday with #TrumpKnew the number one trending hashtag on Twitter worldwide in more than 615,000 tweets, according to the tracking site trends.24.in Trump and his aides previously claimed his slow early reaction to the outbreak was a result of failures by China to warn the world properly.\n\n\"The president never downplayed the virus,\" White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said in a news briefing on Tuesday after the report by The Washington Post.\n\n\"The president has never lied to the public on COVID. The president was expressing calm and his actions reflect that,\" McEnany said.\n\nWoodward's reporting, however, appears to undercut that narrative.\n\n\"I wanted to always play it down,\" Trump told Woodward on March 19.\n\n\"I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic,\" Trump told Woodward in recordings published by The Washington Post. The public alarm was not sounded in the US until February 25 when Dr Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a news briefing the virus was coming.\n\n\"It's not so much of a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen,\" Messonnier said.\n\nUS stock markets tumbled 3 percent on the news that day and Trump, travelling back from India on Air Force One, was angered by the headlines. Messonnier subsequently was sidelined by the White House from further public statements.\n\n\"It's going to disappear. One day, it's like a miracle, it will disappear,\" Trump said publicly as late as February 27.\n\nWoodward's book reveals additional disparaging remarks by Trump about US military leaders, his negotiations with North Korea's Kim Jong Un and his views on the Black Lives Matter protests that have reshaped US politics in the last three months.",

This compares to six percent generally in the Midlands region of England at the time.\n\nTen out of 29 cleaners involved in the study - or 34.5 percent - had antibodies suggesting a previous infection.\n\nThe rates were similar for clinicians working in acute medicine and general internal medicine - 33 percent and 30 percent respectively - while staff working in intensive care had the lowest rates (15 percent, or nine out of 61 participants).\n\nThe authors said it was not clear from their observational study whether the higher rates of infection among some staff \"arises from a greater risk of exposure to the virus, or a greater risk of infection if exposed\".\n\n\"Regardless of the cause, this finding demands urgent further investigation, particularly in view of the ethnic disparities in the outcome from COVID-19,\" they said.\n\nProtecting staff \nA slew of studies in the general population has highlighted how people from minority backgrounds in Britain and the United States are disproportionately more likely to die from COVID-19 than their white counterparts.\n\nLast month a study published in The Lancet Public Health journal found that front-line health workers were more than three times more likely to test positive for the virus than the general population early in the pandemic, with the rate rising to five times for ethnic minority medical staff.\n\nCommenting on the study in Thorax, Tim Cook, an anaesthesia professor at the University of Bristol, said it added to research suggesting those working in intensive care were at lower risk than staff in other parts of a hospital.\n\nHe said the availability and type of PPE could be a factor, as well as familiarity with more rigorous precautions for sterility and infection prevention in emergency rooms.\n\nHe added that recent studies suggested patients were more infectious at the beginning of their illness, so may be less likely to spread the virus by the time that they are treated in intensive care.\n\n\"Those caring for the patients earlier in their illness may be more at risk and this has implications for managing all patient-facing staff on the wards,\" he added.",

On Monday, people at the trade fair crowded around booths showing the potential game-changing vaccines.\n\nIn May, President Xi pledged to make any potential vaccine developed by China a \"global public good\".\n\nThe potential vaccines are among nearly 10 worldwide to enter phase-three trials, typically the last step ahead of regulatory approval, as countries race to stamp out the virus.\n\nSinopharm said it anticipates the antibodies from its jab to last between one and three years - although the final result will only be known after the trials.\n\nChina's state-owned Global Times reported last month that \"the price of the vaccines will not be high\".\n\nEvery two doses should cost below 1,000 yuan ($146), the report said, citing Sinopharm's chairman, who told media he had already been injected with one of the candidate vaccines.\n\nChina's official Xinhua news agency also reported on Monday that another vaccine candidate, developed by Chinese military scientists, was able to deal with mutations in the coronavirus.\n\nAs of last month, at least 5.7 billion doses of the vaccines under development around the world had been pre-ordered.\n\nHowever, the World Health Organization has warned that widespread immunisation against COVID-19 may not be on the cards until the middle of next year.",

            "Text": "As communities in the United States consider how to safely re-open K-12 school buildings and in-person services, CDC offers updated considerations for mitigation strategies that K-12 school administrators can use to help protect students, teachers, and staff and slow the spread of COVID-19.  These updated Considerations for Schools are intended to aid school administrators as they consider how to protect the health, safety, and wellbeing of students, teachers, staff, their families, and communities: \nPromoting behaviors that reduce COVID-19\u2019s spread\nMaintaining healthy environments\nMaintaining healthy operations\nPreparing for when someone gets sick\nSchools should determine, in collaboration with state and local health officials to the extent possible, whether and how to implement each of these considerations while adjusting to meet the unique needs and circumstances of the local community. Implementation should be guided by what is feasible, practical, acceptable, and tailored to the needs of each community. It is also critically important to develop strategies that can be revised and adapted depending on the level of viral transmission in the school and throughout the community and done with close communication with state and/or local public health authorities and recognizing the differences between school districts, including urban, suburban, and rural districts. These considerations are meant to supplement\u2014not replace\u2014any Federal, state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which schools must comply (e.g., Individuals with Disabilities Education Actexternal icon).\n\nSchool-based health facilities may refer to CDC\u2019s Guidance for U.S. Healthcare Facilities and may find it helpful to reference the Ten Ways Healthcare Systems Can Operate Effectively During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Guiding principles to keep in mind\nEveryone\u2019s goal is to prioritize the reopening of schools as safely and as quickly as possible given the many known and established benefits of in-person learning. In order to enable this and assist schools with their day-to-day operations, it is important to adopt and diligently implement actions to slow the spread of COVID-19 inside the school and out in the community. Vigilance to these actions will moderate the risk of in-school transmission regardless of the underlying community burden \u2013 with risk being the lowest if community transmission is low and there is fidelity to implementing proven mitigation strategies.\n\nThe statement The Importance of Reopening America\u2019s Schools this Fall highlights that parents and school leaders are very eager for schools to reopen, but understandably concerned about the health and safety of their children during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nChildren and COVID-19\nIn general, children with COVID-19 are less likely to have severe symptoms than adults or experience an asymptomatic infection \u2013 meaning they do not have any signs or symptoms of disease (1-7).\n\nAnalysis of pediatric COVID-19 hospitalization data from 14 states from early March to late July 2020 found the cumulative rate of COVID-19\u2013associated hospitalization among children was over 20 times lower compared to adults (8.0 versus 164.5 per 100,000 population) (8). Although the cumulative rate is low, one in three children hospitalized with COVID-19 was admitted to an intensive care unit so the risk is not negligible (8). Similarly, the death rate among school-aged children is much lower than the rate among adults (9, 10). Also, the comparatively low risk for hospitalization and death among children themselves must be contextualized to the risk posed to teachers, school administrators, and other staff in the school environment. The risk of teachers, school administrators, and other staff in the school is expected to mirror that of other adults in the community if they contract COVID-19.\n\nTo be sure, the best available evidence from countries that have reopened schools indicates that COVID-19 poses low risks to school-aged children \u2013 at least in areas with low community transmission. That said, the body of evidence is growing that children of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (3-7) and, contrary to early reports (11, 12), might play a role in transmission (7, 13, 14).\n\nThe many benefits of in-person schooling should be weighed against the risks posed by COVID-19 spread. Of key significance, in-person learning is in the best interest of students, when compared to virtual learning. Application and adherence to mitigation measures provided in this document and similar to those implemented at essential workplaces can help schools reopen and stay open safely for in-person learning.\n\nDeciding how to reopen\nSchool officials should make decisions about school reopening based on available data including levels of community transmission and their capacity to implement appropriate mitigation measures in schools to protect students, teachers, administrators, and other staff. Schools should also consider other aspects of students\u2019 risk and wellbeing that arise when schools do not reopen for in-person classes. This includes the potential adverse impacts on students\u2019 social-emotional, behavioral, and mental health, as well as the critical services provided to students to help mitigate health disparities and serve children in need, such as school lunch programs, special education services, after-school programs and mental health services.\n\nThe unique and critical role that schools play makes them a priority for reopening and remaining open, enabling students to receive both academic instruction and enable the provision of other critical services and supports. By strictly implementing mitigation strategies, schools will be able to meet the needs of their students and community, while reducing the risk of COVID-19 spread. Taking actions to lower the risk of COVID-19 spread\nCOVID-19 is mostly spread by respiratory droplets released when people talk, cough, or sneeze. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own eyes, nose, or mouth. Therefore, personal prevention practices (such as handwashing, staying home when sick) and environmental cleaning and disinfection are important principles that are discussed below. Fortunately, there are a number of actions school administrators can take to help lower the risk of COVID-19 exposure and spread during school sessions and activities.\n\nIn order to reach the goal of reopening schools as safely and as quickly as possible for in-person learning, and help schools remain open, it is important to adopt and diligently implement actions to slow the spread of COVID-19 inside the school and out in the community.  This means that students, families, teachers, school staff, and all community members take actions to protect themselves and others where they live, work, learn, and play.\n\nContinuum of risk\nBy model of learning and implementation of proven mitigation strategies\nIn general, the risk of COVID-19 spread in schools increases across the continuum of virtual, hybrid, to in-person learning with the risk moderated for hybrid and in-person learning based upon the range of mitigation strategies put in place and the extent they are conscientiously followed.\n\nWhile not exhaustive, this stratification attempts to characterize the risks of spread among students, teachers, and staff across this continuum:\n\nLowest risk:\n\nStudents and teachers engage in virtual-only classes, activities, and events\nSome risk:\n\nHybrid Learning Model: Some students participate in virtual learning and other students participate in in-person learning\nSmall, in-person classes, activities, and events\nCohorting, alternating schedules, and staggered schedules are applied rigorously\nNo mixing of groups of students and teachers throughout/across school days\nStudents and teachers do not share objects\nStudents, teachers, and staff follow all steps to protect themselves and others at all times including proper use of face masks, social distancing, hand hygiene\nRegularly scheduled (i.e., at least daily or between uses) cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched areas implemented with fidelity\nMedium risk:\n\nHybrid Learning Model: Most students participate in in-person learning, some students participate in virtual learning\nLarger in-person classes, activities, and events\nCohorting, alternating schedules, and staggered schedules are applied with some exceptions\nSome mixing of groups of students and teachers throughout/across school days\nStudents and teachers minimally share objects\nStudents, teachers, and staff follow all steps to protect themselves and others such as proper use of face masks, social distancing, hand hygiene\nRegularly scheduled cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched areas largely implemented with fidelity\nHigher risk:\n\nStudents and teachers engage in in-person only learning, activities, and events\nStudents minimally mix between classes and activities\nStudents and teachers share some objects\nStudents, teachers, and staff follow some steps to protect themselves and others at all times such as proper use of face masks, social distancing, hand hygiene\nIrregular cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched areas\nHighest risk:\n\nStudents and teachers engage in in-person only learning, activities, and events\nStudents mix freely between classes and activities\nStudents and teachers freely share objects\nStudents, teachers, and staff do not/are not required to follow steps to protect themselves and others such as proper use of face masks, social distancing, hand hygiene\nIrregular cleaning and disinfection of frequently touched areas Plan and prepare\nEmergency operations plans: review, update, and implement EOPs\nThe most important actions for school administrators to take before reopening in-person services and facilities are planning and preparing. To best prepare, schools should expect that students, teachers, or staff may contract symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and schools must know what to do when this happens. Regardless of the number of cases in a community, every school should have a plan in place to protect staff, children, and their families from the spread of COVID-19 and a response plan in place for if/when a student, teacher, or staff member tests positive for COVID-19. This plan should be developed in collaboration with state and local public health departments; school nurses, parents, caregivers, and guardians; student leaders; community members; and other relevant partners. Schools should prioritize EOP components that address infectious disease outbreaks and their consequences.\n\nReference key resources on emergency preparedness while reviewing, updating, and implementing the EOP.\nMultiple federal agencies have developed resources on school planning principles and a 6-step processpdf iconexternal icon for creating plans to build and continually foster safe and healthy school communities before, during, and after possible emergencies.\nThe Readiness and Emergency Management for Schools (REMS) Technical Assistance Center\u2019s websiteexternal icon contains free resources, trainings, and technical assistance (TA) for schools and their community partners, including many tools and resources on emergency planning and response to infectious disease outbreaks. Schools may find these considerations are helpful for developing high-quality emergency operations plans.\nSchool nurses, teachers, staff, parents, student leaders, and other community stakeholders (e.g., youth service organizations, health centers, etc.) should be involved in the development of the Emergency Operations Plans (EOP). Some of the strategies school administrators should consider while developing their EOP:\n\nDevelop a protocol for monitoring local COVID-19 data in your community to keep track of the level of community transmission, to make decisions about changes to mitigation strategies, and to help determine whether school closures may be necessary. This should include daily review of official public health data for the community surrounding the school. Contact the state, local, tribal, or territorial Public Health Department for references to local COVID-19 data.\nDevelop and test information-sharing systems (e.g., school-to-parent email or texting protocols, periodic virtual meetings with parent/teachers, etc.) with school and community partners and key stakeholders. Use institutional information systems for day-to-day reporting on information that can help to detect and respond to an outbreak, such as number of cases and absenteeism or changes in the number of visits to the health center by students, teachers, and other staff.\nAdopt mitigation strategies to promote healthy behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19, maintain healthy school environments and operations, and plan what to do if a student, teacher, or staff member gets sick.\nExamine the accessibility of information and resources to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and maintain healthy environments and determine whether they are culturally relevant, in plain language, and available in appropriate languages and accessible formats.\nIn consultation with local officials, establish transparent criteria for when the school will suspend in-person learning to stop or slow the spread of COVID-19, as well as transparent criteria for when to resume in-person learning.\nAssess students\u2019 special needs (such as continuing education, meal programs, and other services) and develop strategies to address these needs if in-person learning is suspended or if a student needs to self-isolate as a result of a diagnosis of or exposure to COVID-19.\nEnsure the EOP takes into consideration students with disabilities, students with special healthcare needs, students experiencing homelessness, migrant students and those with English learners, etc. Promote behaviors that reduce spread of COVID-19\n\nSchools may consider implementing several strategies to encourage behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19.\n\nStaying home when appropriate\n\nEducate staff and families about when they/their child(ren) should stay home and when they can return to school.\n\nActively encourage employees and students who are sick or who have recently had close contact (less than 6 feet for fifteen minutes or more) with a person with COVID-19 to stay home. Develop policies that encourage sick employees and students to stay at home without fear of reprisal, and ensure employees, students, and students\u2019 families are aware of these policies. Consider not assessing schools based on absenteeism, and offering virtual learning and telework options, if feasible.\nStaff and students should stay home if they have tested positive for or are showing COVID-19 symptoms.\nStaff and students who have recently had close contact with a person with COVID-19 should also stay home and monitor their health.\nCDC\u2019s criteria can help inform when employees should return to work:\nIf they have been sick with COVID-19\nIf they have recently had close contact with a person with COVID-19\nHand hygiene and respiratory etiquette\n\nTeach and reinforce handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and increase monitoring to ensure adherence among students and staff.\nEncourage staff and students to cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Used tissues should be thrown in the trash and hands washed immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\nIf soap and water are not readily available, hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol should be used (for staff and older children who can safely use hand sanitizer).\nMasks\n\nTeach and reinforce use of masks. The use of masks is one of many important mitigation strategies to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Masks are meant to protect other people in case the wearer is unknowingly infected but does not have symptoms. Masks are not Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) (e.g., surgical masks, respirators).\nAppropriate and consistent use of masks is most important when students, teachers, and staff are indoors and when social distancing is difficult to implement or maintain. Individuals should be frequently reminded not to touch the face covering or mask and to wash their hands or use hand sanitizer frequently. Information should be provided to staff, students, and students\u2019 families on proper use, removal, and washing of masks.\nMasks should not be placed on:\nChildren younger than 2 years old\nAnyone who has trouble breathing or is unconscious\nAnyone who is incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance\nAppropriate and consistent use of masks may be challenging for some students, teachers, and staff, including:\nYounger students, such as those in early elementary school (Pre-K through 3rd grade).\nStudents, teachers, and staff with severe asthma or other breathing difficulties.\nStudents, teachers, and staff with special educational or healthcare needs, including intellectual and developmental disabilities, mental health conditions, and sensory concerns or tactile sensitivity.\nWhile masks are strongly encouraged to reduce the spread of COVID-19, CDC recognizes there are specific instances when wearing a mask may not be feasible. In these instances, parents, guardians, caregivers, teachers, staff, and school administrators should consider adaptations and alternatives whenever possible. They may need to consult with healthcare providers for advice about wearing masks.\nPeople who are deaf or hard of hearing\u2014or those who care for or interact with a person who is hearing impaired\u2014may be unable to wear masks if they rely on lipreading to communicate. This may be particularly relevant for faculty or staff teaching or working with students who may be deaf or hard of hearing. In this situation, consider using a clear mask that covers the nose and wraps securely around the face. If a clear mask isn\u2019t available, consider whether faculty and staff can use written communication (including closed captioning) and decrease background noise to improve communication while wearing a mask that blocks your lips.\nMasks are recommended as a simple barrier to help prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air and onto other people when the person wearing the mask coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice. This is called source control.\nIn addition to those who interact with people who are deaf or hard of hearing, the following groups of teachers and staff may also consider using clear masks:\nTeachers of young students (e.g., teaching young students to read).\nTeachers of students who are English language learners\nTeachers of students with disabilities\nClear masks should be determined not to cause any breathing difficulties or over heating for the wearer. Clear masks are not face shields. CDC does not recommend use of face shields for normal everyday activities or as a substitute for masks because of a lack of evidence of their effectiveness to control the spread of the virus from the source for source control.\nAdequate supplies\n\nSupport healthy hygiene behaviors by providing adequate supplies, including soap and water, hand sanitizer with at least 60%  alcohol (for staff and older children who can safely use hand sanitizer), paper towels, tissues, disinfectant wipes, masks (as feasible) and no-touch/foot-pedal trash cans.\n\nSigns and messages\n\nPost signs in highly visible locations (e.g., school entrances, restrooms) that promote everyday protective measurespdf icon and describe how to stop the spreadpdf icon of germs (such as by properly washing hands and properly wearing a maskimage icon). Signs should include visual cues (such as clear, easy-to-understand pictures demonstrating the healthy behaviors) at the appropriate reading and literacy level.\nBroadcast regular announcements on reducing the spread of COVID-19 on PA systems.\nUse simple, clear, and effective language about behaviors that prevent spread of COVID-19 when communicating with staff and families (such as on school websites, in emails, and through school social media accounts). If feasible, provide communication in multiple languages.\nUse communication methods that are accessible for all students, faculty, and staff, including those with disabilities.\nTranslate materials into common languages spoken by students, faculty, and staff and people in the school community.\nFind freely available CDC print and digital resources on CDC\u2019s communications resources main page. CDC also has American Sign Language videos related to COVID-19 and other communication tools. Maintaining healthy environments\n\nSchool administrators may consider implementing several strategies to maintain healthy environments.\n\nCleaning and disinfection\n\nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (e.g., playground equipment, door handles, sink handles, drinking fountains) within the school and on school buses at least daily or between use as much as possible. Use of shared objects (e.g., gym or physical education equipment, art supplies, toys, games) should be limited when possible, or cleaned between use.\nDevelop a schedule for increased frequency of routine cleaning and disinfection.\nIf transport vehicles (e.g., buses) are used by the school, drivers should practice all safety actions and protocols as indicated for other staff (e.g., hand hygiene, masks). To clean and disinfect school buses or other transport vehicles, see guidance for bus transit operators.\nDevelop a schedule for increased, routine cleaning and disinfection.\nEnsure safe and correct use and storage of cleaning and disinfection productsexternal icon, including storing products securely away from children. Use products that meet EPA disinfection criteriaexternal icon.\nCleaning products should not be used near children, and staff should ensure that there is adequate ventilation when using these products to prevent children or themselves from inhaling toxic fumes.\nShared objects\n\nDiscourage sharing of items that are difficult to clean or disinfect.\nKeep each child\u2019s belongings separated from others\u2019 and in individually labeled containers, cubbies, or areas.\nEnsure adequate supplies to minimize sharing of high touch materials to the extent possible (e.g., assigning each student their own art supplies, equipment) or limit use of supplies and equipment by one group of children at a time and clean and disinfect between use.\nAvoid sharing electronic devices, toys, books, and other games or learning aids.\nVentilation\n\nConsider ventilation system upgrades or improvements and other steps to increase the delivery of clean air and dilute potential contaminants in the school. Obtain consultation from experienced Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) professionals when considering changes to HVAC systems and equipment.  Some of the recommendations below are based on the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Guidance for Building Operations During the COVID-19 Pandemicexternal icon. Review additional ASHRAE guidelines for schools and universitiespdf iconexternal icon for further information on ventilation recommendations for different types of buildings and building readiness for occupancy. Not all steps are applicable for all scenarios.\n\nImprovement steps may include some or all of the following activities:\n\nIncrease outdoor air ventilation, using caution in highly polluted areas.\nWhen weather conditions allow, increase fresh outdoor air by opening windows and doors. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk (e.g., risk of falling, triggering asthma symptoms) to children using the facility.\nUse fans to increase the effectiveness of open windows.  Position fans securely and carefully in or near windows so as not to induce potentially contaminated airflow directly from one person over another (strategic window fan placement in exhaust mode can help draw fresh air into room via other open windows and doors without generating strong room air currents).\nDecrease occupancy in areas where outdoor ventilation cannot be increased.\nEnsure ventilation systems operate properly and provide acceptable indoor air quality for the current occupancy level for each space.\nIncrease total airflow supply to occupied spaces, when possible.\nDisable demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) controls that reduce air supply based on occupancy or temperature during occupied hours.\nFurther open minimum outdoor air dampers to reduce or eliminate HVAC air recirculation. In mild weather, this will not affect thermal comfort or humidity. However, this may be difficult to do in cold, hot, or humid weather.\nImprove central air filtration:\nIncrease air filtrationexternal icon to as high as possible without significantly diminishing design airflow.\nInspect filter housing and racks to ensure appropriate filter fit and check for ways to minimize filter bypass\nCheck filters to ensure they are within service life and appropriately installed.\nConsider running the HVAC system at maximum outside airflow for 2 hours before and after the school is occupied.\nEnsure restroom exhaust fans are functional and operating at full capacity when the school is occupied.\nInspect and maintain local exhaust ventilation in areas such as restrooms, kitchens, cooking areas, etc.\nUse portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) fan/filtration systems to help enhance air cleaning (especially in higher risk areas such as the nurse\u2019s office).\nInspect and maintain local exhaust ventilation in areas such as bathrooms, kitchens, cooking areas, etc.\nUse portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) fan/filtration systems to help enhance air cleaning (especially in higher risk areas such as nurse\u2019s office and special education classrooms).\nGenerate clean-to-less-clean air movement by re-evaluating the positioning of supply and exhaust air diffusers and/or dampers (especially in higher risk areas such as the nurse\u2019s office).\nConsider using ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) as a supplement to help inactivate SARS-CoV-2, especially if options for increasing room ventilation are limited.\nVentilation considerations are also important on school buses.\n*Note: The ventilation intervention considerations listed above come with a range of initial costs and operating costs which, along with risk assessment parameters such as community incidence rates, facemask compliance expectations and classroom density, may affect considerations for which interventions are implemented.  Acquisition cost estimates (per room) for the listed ventilation interventions range from $0.00 (opening a window; inspecting and maintain local exhaust ventilation; disabling DCV controls; or repositioning outdoor air dampers) to <$100 (using fans to increase effectiveness of open windows; or repositioning supply/exhaust diffusers to create directional airflow) to approx. $500 (adding portable HEPA fan/filter systems) to approx. $1500 (adding upper room UVGI).\n\nWater systems\n\nThe temporary shutdown or reduced operation of schools and reductions in normal water use can create hazards for returning students and staff. To minimize the risk of lead or copper exposure, Legionnaire\u2019s disease, and other diseases associated with water, take steps such as plumbing flushing to ensure that all water systems and features (e.g., sink faucets, drinking fountains, showers, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown, and follow EPA\u2019s 3Ts, (Training, Testing, and Taking Action) for reducing lead in drinking waterexternal icon. It may be necessary to conduct ongoing regular flushing after reopening. For additional resources, refer to EPA\u2019s Information on Maintaining or Restoring Water Quality in Buildings with Low or No Useexternal icon. Drinking fountains should be cleaned and sanitized.\n\nModified layouts\n\nSpace seating/desks at least 6 feet apart when feasible.\nTurn desks to face in the same direction (rather than facing each other), or have students sit on only one side of tables, spaced apart.\nModify learning stations and activities as applicable so there are fewer students per group, placed at least 6 feet apart if possible.\nCreate distance between children on school buses (g., seat children one child per row, skip rows) when possible.\nPhysical barriers and guides\n\nInstall physical barriers, such as sneeze guards and partitions, particularly in areas where it is difficult for individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart (e.g., reception desks).\nProvide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls, to ensure that staff and children remain at least 6 feet apart in lines and at other times (e.g. guides for creating \u201cone way routes\u201d in hallways).\nCommunal spaces\n\nClose communal use shared spaces such as dining halls and playgrounds with shared playground equipment if possible; otherwise, stagger use and clean and disinfect between use.\nAdd physical barriers, such as plastic flexible screens, between bathroom sinks especially when they cannot be at least 6 feet apart.\nFood service\n\nSchools are essential to meeting the nutritional needs of children with many consuming up to half their daily calories at school. Nationwide more than 30 million children participate in the National School Lunch Program and nearly 15 million participate in the School Breakfast Program. (15, 16) There are several mitigation strategies that schools may implement while providing this critical service to their students.\nAvoid offering any self-serve food or drink options, such as hot and cold food bars, salad or condiment bars, and drink stations. Serve individually plated or pre-packaged meals instead, while ensuring the safety of children with food allergiespdf icon.\nAs feasible, have children eat meals outdoors or in classrooms, while maintaining social distance (at least 6 feet apart) as much as possible, instead of in a communal dining hall or cafeteria.\nHave teachers and children wash their hands with soap and water for 20 seconds or use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol before and after eating. Ensure children do not share food, either brought from home or from the food service.\nIf communal dining halls or cafeterias will be used, ensure that children remain at least 6 feet apart in food service lines and at tables while eating. Clean and disinfect tables and chairs between each use.\nEnsure children do not share food or utensils. This helps prevent the spread of COVID-19 for all students and helps ensure the safety of children with food allergiespdf icon:\nUse disposable food service items (e.g., utensils, trays).\nIf disposable items are not feasible or desirable, ensure that all non-disposable food service items and equipment are handled by staff with gloves and washed with dish soap and hot water or in a dishwasher.\nIndividuals should wash their hands after removing their gloves or after directly handling used food service items.\nIf food is offered at any event, have pre-packaged boxes or bags for each attendee instead of a buffet or family-style meal.\nProvide tissues and no-touch or foot pedal trash cans, where possible, for employees, volunteers, and students to use.\nIf possible, install touchless payment methods (pay without touching money, a card, or a keypad). Provide hand sanitizer right after handling money, cards, or keypads.\nOf Note: USDA has issued the COVID-19 Nationwide Waiver to Allow Meal Pattern Flexibility in the Child Nutrition Programsexternal icon. Maintaining healthy operations\n\nSchools may consider implementing several strategies to maintain healthy operations.\n\nProtections for staff and children at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19\n\nOffer options for staff at higher risk for severe illness (including older adults and people of all ages with certain underlying medical conditions or disabilities) that limit their exposure risk (e.g., telework, modified job responsibilities that limit exposure risk).\nOffer options for students at higher risk of severe illness that limit their exposure risk (e.g., virtual learning opportunities).\nProvide inclusive programming for children and youth with special healthcare needs and disabilities that allows on-site or virtual participation with appropriate accommodations, modifications, and assistance (e.g., students with disabilities may have more difficulties accessing and using technology for virtual learning).\nConsistent with applicable law, put in place policies to protect the privacy of people at higher risk for severe illness regarding underlying medical conditions.\nRegulatory awareness\n\nBe aware of local or state regulatory agency policies related to group gatherings to determine if events can be held.\n\nIdentifying small groups and keeping them together (cohorting or podding)\n\nDividing students and teachers into distinct groups that stay together throughout an entire school day during in-person classroom instruction. Limit mixing between groups such that there is minimal or no interaction between cohorts.\n\nAlternating schedule\n\nAlternate the days when cohorts physically attend school. For example, certain grades or classrooms physically attend school on Monday/Tuesday and other grades or classrooms physically attend on Thursday/Friday (and the school is thoroughly cleaned in between, on Wednesday). As another example, some schools internationally have rotated in-person attendance weekly with one group of students attending during a week, followed by a different group the next week in rotation with thorough cleaning on the weekends.\n\nStaggered scheduling\n\nStagger student arrival, drop-off, and pick-up time or locations by cohort, or put in place other protocols to limit contact between cohorts and direct contact with parents, guardians, and caregivers as much as possible.\nWhen possible, use flexible worksites (e.g., telework at home) and flexible work hours (e.g., staggered shifts) to help establish policies and practices for social distancing (staying at least 6 feet apart).\nMix of virtual learning and in-class learning (hybrid schedule)\n\nHybrid options can apply a cohort approach to the in-class education provided.\n\nVirtual/at-home only\n\nStudents and teachers engage in virtual-only classes, activities, and events.\n\nGatherings, visitors, and field trips\n\nPursue virtual group events, gatherings, or meetings, if possible, and promote social distancing of at least 6 feet between people if events are held. Limit group size to the extent possible.\nPursue options to convene sporting events and participate in sports activities in ways that reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to players, families, coaches, and communities.\nLimit any nonessential visitors, volunteers, and activities involving external groups or organizations as possible \u2013 especially with individuals who are not from the local geographic area (e.g., community, town, city, county).\nLimit cross-school transfer for special programs. For example, if students are brought from multiple schools for special programs (e.g., music, robotics, academic clubs, sports), consider using distance learning and virtual environments to deliver the instruction or temporarily offering duplicate programs in the participating schools.  For youth sports considerations visit the FAQs for Youth Sports Programs (e.g., physical distance, wearing masks, etc.).\nDevelop a plan for staff who travel between schools (e.g., school nurses, psychologists, therapists). For example, consider allowing them to have virtual meetings in place of physical school visits and revise scheduling to limit their visits to multiple campuses.\nPursue virtual activities and events in lieu of field trips, student assemblies, special performances, school-wide parent meetings, and spirit nights, as possible.\nDesignated COVID-19 point of contact\n\nDesignate a staff person, such as the school nurse, to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns. All school staff and families should know who this person is and how to contact them.\n\nTravel and transit\n\nConsider options for limiting non-essential travel in accordance with state and local regulations and guidance.\nConsider postponing or canceling upcoming student international travel programs.\nEncourage students, faculty and staff who use public transportation or ride sharing to use forms of transportation that minimize close contact with others (e.g., biking, walking, driving or riding by car either alone or with household members).\nEnsure options for safe travel on campus for people with disabilities. For example, social distancing in designated seating areas for wheelchairs may not be possible and drivers who may need to have close contact to assist a person with disabilities.\nEncourage students, faculty and staff who use public transportation or ride sharing to follow CDC guidance on how to protect yourself when using Additionally, encourage them to commute during less busy times and clean their hands as soon as possible after their trip.\nParticipation in community response efforts\n\nConsider participating with local authorities in broader COVID-19 community response efforts (e.g., sitting on community response committees).\n\nCommunication systems\n\nPut systems in place for:\n\nStaff and families should self-report to the school if they or their student have symptoms of COVID-19, a positive test for COVID-19, or were exposed to someone with COVID-19 within the last 14 days. The reporting system should be consistent with the health information sharing regulations for COVID-19external icon (e.g. see \u201cNotify Health Officials and Close Contacts\u201d in the Preparing for When Someone Gets Sick section below) and other applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and confidentiality, such as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). The communication methods should be accessible for all students, faculty and staff, including those with disabilities and limited English proficiency (e.g., use interpreters and translated materials)\nNotifying staff, families, and the public of school closures and any restrictions in place to limit COVID-19 exposure (e.g., limited hours of operation).\nLeave (time off) policies and excused absence policies\n\nImplement flexible sick leave policies and practices that enable staff to stay home when they are sick, have been exposed, or caring for someone who is sick.\nExamine and revise policies for leave, telework, and employee compensation.\nLeave policies should be flexible and not punish people for taking time off and should allow sick employees to stay home and away from co-workers. Leave policies should also account for employees who need to stay home with their children if there are school or childcare closures, or to care for sick family members.  Additional flexibilities might include giving advances on future sick leave days and allowing employees to donate sick leave to each other, for example.\nDevelop policies for return-to-school after COVID-19 illness. CDC\u2019s criteria to discontinue home isolation and quarantine can inform these policies.\nBack-up staffing plan\n\nMonitor absenteeism of students and employees, cross-train staff, and create a roster of trained back-up staff.\n\nStaff training\n\nTrain staff on all safety protocols.\nConduct training virtually or ensure that social distancing is maintained during training.\nRecognize signs and symptoms\n\nWe learn more about COVID-19 every day, and as more information becomes available, CDC will continue to update and share information. As our knowledge and understanding of COVID-19 evolves, this guidance may change.\n\nBased on the best available evidence at this time:\n\nCDC does not currently recommend universal symptom screenings (screening all students grades K-12) be conducted by schools.\nParents or caregivers should be strongly encouraged to monitor their children for signs of infectious illness including COVID-19 every day.\nStudents who have symptoms of any infectious illness or symptoms consistent with COVID-19 should not attend school in-person.\nThe profile of symptoms associated with COVID-19 remains under study and will be updated as warranted by research findings. Further information on what symptoms may suggest infectious illness and recommended return-to-school policies is available at Screening K-12 Students for Symptoms of COVID-19: Limitations and Considerations.\nSchools that choose to conduct symptom screening should conduct these screenings safely and respectfully, and in accordance with any applicable privacy laws and regulations (e.g., confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act [FERPA]).\nThe considerations detailed here are intended only for students in K-12 school settings. For guidance related to screening of staff, please refer to CDC\u2019s Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers Responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 and the Prevent Transmission Among Employees section of CDC\u2019s Resuming Business Toolkitpdf icon.\nSharing facilities\n\nEncourage any organizations that share or use the school facilities to also follow these considerations.\n\nSupport coping and resilience \n\nEncourage employees and students to take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories about COVID-19, including social media if they are feeling overwhelmed or distressed.\nPromote employees and students eating healthy, exercising, getting sleep, and finding time to unwind.\nEncourage employees and students to talk with people they trust about their concerns and how they are feeling.\nTransparently communicate with staff, teachers, students, and families, including about mental health support services available at the school. These critical communications should be accessible to individuals with disabilities and limited English proficiency.\nShare facts about COVID-19 regularly through trusted sources of information to counter the spread of misinformation and mitigate fear.\nConsider posting signages for the national distress hotline: 1-800-985-5990, or text TalkWithUsto 66746\nEnsure continuity of mental health services, such as offering remote counseling.\nEncourage students to call 911 or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255), 1-888-628-9454 for Spanish, or Lifeline Crisis Chatexternal icon if they are feeling overwhelmed with emotions such as sadness, depression, anxiety, or feel like wanting to harm themselves or others. Prepare for when someone is sick with COVID-19\n\nSchools may consider implementing several strategies to prepare for when someone is sick with COVID-19.\n\nAdvise staff and families of students sick with COVID-19 of home isolation criteria\n\nSick staff members or students should not return until they have met CDC\u2019s criteria to discontinue home isolation.\n\nMake sure that staff and families know when they should stay home\n\nMake sure that staff and families know that they (staff) or their children (families) should not come to school, and that they should notify school officials (e.g., the designated COVID-19 point of contact [e.g., school nurse]) if they (staff) or their child (families) test positive for COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 symptoms or a confirmed or suspected case. These critical communications should be accessible to individuals with disabilities and limited English proficiency.\n\nIsolate and transport students who develop symptoms while at school\n\nSome students may develop symptoms of infectious illness while at school. Schools should take action to isolate students who develop these symptoms from other students and staff. Follow the school isolation protocol outlined in Screening K-12 Students for Symptoms of COVID-19: Limitations and Considerations when student develops symptoms of an infectious illness.\n\nClean and disinfect\n\nClose off areas used by a sick person and do not use these areas until after cleaning and disinfecting them. For outdoor areas (e.g., playgrounds, sitting areas, outdoor eating areas, etc.), this includes surfaces or shared objects in the area, if applicable.\nWait at least 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting. If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible. Ensure safe and correct use and storage of cleaning and disinfection productsexternal icon, including storing products securely away from children.\nNotify health officials and close contacts\n\nIn accordance with state and local laws and regulations, school administrators should notify local health officials, staff, and families immediately of any case of COVID-19 while maintaining confidentiality in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)external icon and FERPAexternal icon or and other applicable laws and regulations.\nInform those who have had close contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19 to stay home and self-monitor for symptoms, and follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop. Maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)external icon and Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) or and other applicable laws and regulations.\nA school might need to implement short-term building closure procedures if/when an infected person has been on campus during their infectious period and has close contact with others. If this happens, work with local public health officials to determine next steps. One option is an initial short-term class suspension and cancellation of events and activities (e.g., assemblies, spirit nights, field trips, and sporting events) to allow time for local health officials to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation and help the school determine appropriate next steps, including whether such a suspension needs to be extended to stop or slow further spread of COVID-19.  In situations where schools are cohorting students (e.g., in pods) administrators may choose to close the building in places (e.g., classrooms, common areas) where others were exposed to the infected person. In the event that local health officials do not recommend building or classroom closures, thoroughly cleaning the areas where the infected person spent significant time should be considered.\nLocal health officials\u2019 recommendations whether to suspend school or events and the duration such suspensions should be made on a case-by-case basis using the most up-to-date information about COVID-19 and taking into account local case-counts, and the degree of ongoing transmission in the community. Students with disabilities or special healthcare needs\nPlan for accommodations, modifications, and assistance for children and youth with disabilities and special healthcare needs\n\nA customized and individualized approach for COVID-19 may be needed for children and youth with disabilities who have limited mobility; have difficulty accessing information due to visual, hearing, or other limiting factors; require close contact with direct service providers; have trouble understanding information; have difficulties with changes in routines; or have other concerns related to their disability. This approach should account for the following:\n\nEducation should remain accessible for children in special education who have a 504 Plan or Individualized Education Program.\nSocial distancing and isolating at school may be difficult for many people with disabilities.\nWearing masks may be difficult for people with certain disabilities (e.g., visual or hearing impairments) or for those with sensory, cognitive, or behavioral issues.\nStudents may require assistance or visual and verbal reminders to cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when they cough or sneeze, throw the tissue in the trash, and wash their hands afterwards.\nWhere service or therapy animals are used, use guidance to protect the animal from COVID-19.\nCleaning and disinfecting procedures may negatively affect students with sensory or respiratory issues.\nStudents may require assistance or supervision washing their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using a hand sanitizer (containing at least 60% alcohol).\nCleaning and disinfecting personal belongings, school objects, or surfaces may require assistance or supervision.\nBehavioral techniques can help all students, adjust to changes in routines and take preventive actions. These techniques may be especially beneficial for some children with disabilities and may include modeling and reinforcing desired behaviors and using picture schedules, timers, and visual cues. Organizations that support individuals with disabilities have information and resources to help schools with these behavioral techniques. In addition, behavioral therapists or local mental health or behavioral health agencies may be able to provide consultation for specific concerns.\nFollow guidance for Direct Service Providers (DSPs)\n\nDirect Service Providers (personal care attendants, direct support professionals, paraprofessionals, therapists, and others) provide a variety of home and community-based, health-related services that support individuals with disabilities. Services provided may include assistance with activities of daily living, access to health services, and more. DSPs are essential for the health and well-being of the individuals they serve.\n\nAsk Direct Service Providers (DSPs) before they enter school if they are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19 or if they have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19. If DSPs provide services in other schools, ask specifically whether any of the other schools have had positive cases. For guidance related to screening of staff (to include DSPs), please refer to CDC\u2019s Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers Responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 and the Prevent Transmission Among Employees section of CDC\u2019s Resuming Business Toolkitpdf icon.\nIf there is potential that a DSP may be splashed or sprayed by bodily fluids during their work, they should use standard precautions to avoid getting infected. They will need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) including a facemask, eye protection, disposable gloves, and a gown.\nCDC has developed guidance for DSPs. School administrators should review the DSP guidance and ensure that DSPs needing to enter the school are aware of those preventive actions.",

            "Text": "Introduction\nInformation sharing among international and national stakeholders during the ongoing COVID-19 response is critical for a coordinated response. Emergency Management Systems Integration (EMSI) is the process of bringing together the public health programs, emergency management systems, and best practices into one cohesive system to enhance the prevention, detection and response to public health events. EMSI supports the coordination of information flow and resource sharing among the disaster management authorities, multisectoral ministries and external partners responding to COVID-19. This involves integrating and streamlining existing \u2014 often disparate \u2014 public health systems in such a way that focuses on increasing the effectiveness of a public health preparedness and response program before, during, and after a public health event to ensure optimal response decision-making and strategy.\n\nThis document aims to provide critical COVID-19 information metrics by technical area that response leaders in non-U.S. settings can request to aid in informing COVID-19 response decisions. This document includes a set of core metrics within 10 technical areas for response leaders to help monitor response progress and guide decision making.   This list was drawn from World Health Organization (WHO) and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 guidance documents with consultation from the CDC Operations and International Task Force subject matter experts in the corresponding technical areas.1-12 This document is not meant to be exhaustive but to identify those information metrics that are critical to inform response leadership.

            "Text": "In the spring of 2009, a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged. It was detected first in the United States and spread quickly across the United States and the world. This new H1N1 virus contained a unique combination of influenza genes not previously identified in animals or people. This virus was designated as influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus. Ten years later work continues to better understand influenza, prevent disease, and prepare for the next pandemic. The 2009 H1N1 Pandemic: A New Flu Virus Emerges\nThe (H1N1)pdm09 virus was very different from H1N1 viruses that were circulating at the time of the pandemic. Few young people had any existing immunity (as detected by antibody response) to the (H1N1)pdm09 virus, but nearly one-third of people over 60 years old had antibodies against this virus, likely from exposure to an older H1N1 virus earlier in their lives. Since the (H1N1)pdm09 virus was very different from circulating H1N1 viruses, vaccination with seasonal flu vaccines offered little cross-protection against (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. While a monovalent (H1N1)pdm09 vaccine was produced, it was not available in large quantities until late November\u2014after the peak of illness during the second wave had come and gone in the United States. From April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010, CDC estimated there were 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (range: 195,086-402,719), and 12,469 deaths (range: 8868-18,306) in the United States due to the (H1N1)pdm09 virus. Additionally, CDC estimated that 151,700-575,400 people worldwide died from (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection during the first year the virus circulated.** Globally, 80 percent of (H1N1)pdm09 virus-related deaths were estimated to have occurred in people younger than 65 years of age. This differs greatly from typical seasonal influenza epidemics, during which about 70 percent to 90 percent of deaths are estimated to occur in people 65 years and older.\n\nThough the 2009 flu pandemic primarily affected children and young and middle-aged adults, the impact of the (H1N1)pdm09 virus on the global population during the first year was less severe than that of previous pandemics. Estimates of pandemic influenza mortality ranged from 0.03 percent of the world\u2019s population during the 1968 H3N2 pandemic to 1 percent to 3 percent of the world\u2019s population during the 1918 H1N1 pandemic. It is estimated that 0.001 percent to 0.007 percent of the world\u2019s population died of respiratory complications associated with (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection during the first 12 months the virus circulated.\n\nThe United States mounted a complex, multi-faceted and long-term response to the pandemic, summarized in The 2009 H1N1 Pandemic: Summary Highlights, April 2009-April 2010. On August 10, 2010, WHO declared an end to the global 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. However, (H1N1)pdm09 virus continues to circulate as a seasonal flu virus, and cause illness, hospitalization, and deaths worldwide every year.",

Although there is not universal consensus regarding where the virus originated, it spread worldwide during 1918-1919.  In the United States, it was first identified in military personnel in spring 1918. It is estimated that about 500 million people or one-third of the world\u2019s population became infected with this virus. The number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide with about 675,000 occurring in the United States. Mortality was high in people younger than 5 years old, 20-40 years old, and 65 years and older. The high mortality in healthy people, including those in the 20-40 year age group, was a unique feature of this pandemic. While the 1918 H1N1 virus has been synthesized and evaluated, the properties that made it so devastating are not well understood. With no vaccine to protect against influenza infection and no antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections that can be associated with influenza infections, control efforts worldwide were limited to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as isolation, quarantine, good personal hygiene, use of disinfectants, and limitations of public gatherings, which were applied unevenly.",

The 2009 H1N1 pandemic was estimated to be associated with 151,700 to 575,400 deaths worldwide during the first year it circulated. [1] This H1N1 virus has continued to circulate seasonally to this day. CDC and its many partners have made great strides in the fields of influenza surveillance, prevention, and treatment since 2009, benefiting both the annual response to seasonal flu epidemics, as well as the global capacity to respond to the next pandemic. Key improvements are summarized on the pages below. Gene sequencing technology\nTest tubes\nDuring the pandemic, owing in part to the preparedness work done prior to 2009, CDC and public health laboratories were able to use molecular testing technology, \u201cwith its pinpoint accuracy and revolutionary speed\u201d [2] to detect cases, and monitor the spread of the virus and its characteristics, including watching for emerging drug resistance, for example. In the wake of the 2009 pandemic, numerous retrospective analyses deemed the use of this technology to be one of the response\u2019s key successes [3].\n\nSince the pandemic, CDC\u2019s ability to map the complete influenza virus genome has improved exponentially, thanks to considerable leaps forward in gene sequencing technology, sometimes referred to as Next Generation Sequencing or Advanced Molecular Detection (AMD) technology. Where previous technologies revealed the genes of the predominant influenza virus in a respiratory specimen, it\u2019s now possible to see the gene sequences of all of the influenza particles in a single specimen, thereby giving deeper insight into how influenza viruses may change, for example, by mutating inside a single patient to become resistant to antiviral drugs.\n\nIn 2012 CDC\u2019s influenza laboratory transitioned from a characterization-first approach to a sequence-first approach so now all flu viruses undergo full sequencing as a first step when they arrive at CDC. This change has reduced public health response time to flu outbreaks and also served to greatly expand the global repositories of influenza gene sequence data. Meanwhile, ongoing technological improvements by device manufacturers and CDC\u2019s innovative protocols have brought the gene sequencing cost per virus down from about $180.00 in 2012 to $25.00 per virus in 2019, with additional improvements in the works to bring the cost down even further.\n\nIn 2009, CDC sequenced influenza virus genomes primarily for the identification of vaccine reference viruses. Now, CDC performs \u201cnext generation sequencing\u201d on close to 7,000 influenza viruses annually, and has submitted more than 30,000 flu virus genomes to public databases. Influenza public health laboratory tests\nRT-PCR nce 2009, the widespread adoption by public health laboratories of the testing technique called \u201creal-time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction\u201d (rRT-PCR) with CDC\u2019s flu rRT-PCR test kits has directly enhanced the nation\u2019s pandemic preparedness in a number of ways. For one, widespread use of both has led to standardization of influenza testing across the nation\u2019s public health laboratories. Relative to the other diagnostic methods widely used by laboratories to reveal the type and subtype of flu virus in a sample, rRT-PCR produces more-reliable results, and produces those results faster than most other laboratory techniques. [4]\n\nCDC\u2019s primary rRT-PCR test for influenza viruses (called the \u2018CDC Human Influenza Virus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel\u2019) is an internationally recognized reference method for detection of influenza. This means the performance of other detection methods is often measured against the performance of CDC\u2019s rRT-PCR flu test.\n\nThe adaptability of the rRT-PCR test allows laboratories to quickly adjust how specimens are processed in outbreak and pandemic situations to avoid backlogs and unnecessary use of resources. CDC provides algorithms that help to ensure that as more specimens are tested, reagents are conserved, thereby maximizing their public health benefit and further reducing the possibility of supply shortages.\n\nAlthough laboratories have the option of using other rRT-PCR tests, use of the CDC test in lieu of commercially manufactured rRT-PCR tests takes the pressure off individual laboratories of ensuring their tests are able to detect the newest emerging viruses.\n\nCDC uses gene sequence data to update its influenza diagnostic kits and reagents, which are used around the world by public health laboratories as the gold-standard for detecting influenza, in large part because of CDC\u2019s rapid response in updating the kits and reagents each time a novel virus emerges.\n\nFor example, in 2012 the U.S. experienced a rapid up-tick in human infections with swine influenza viruses (called variant virus infections) associated with exposure to infected pigs. CDC quickly confirmed the CDC rRT-PCR test kit\u2019s ability to detect those swine viruses appearing in people, and then issued guidance to laboratories on how to interpret rRT-PCR test results when testing specimens from patients with known pig exposure. Since then, CDC has monitored how the diagnostic kit has performed in detecting variant infections and has updated guidance and virus-specific assay materials (called reagents) to make sure the tests are able to detect these viruses as they have evolved.\n\nIn April 2013, shortly after the first influenza A(H7N9) human infections in China were reported and within days of China CDC sharing gene sequences of the H7N9 virus, U.S. CDC quickly modified and then quality-checked CDC\u2019s existing H7 rRT-PCR test and drafted protocols and guidance for its use. On April 22, 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization and the H7 rRT-PCR test with test components and CDC guidance were made available to public health laboratories so they would be able to test for H7N9 viruses too. International Reagent Resource\nWhile RT-PCR is fast and accurate, it requires a steady stream of laboratory supplies called reagents (primers, probes and enzymes) to perform testing, which can become scarce or costly during outbreaks when testing demands increase.\n\nTo address this potential shortcoming, in 2008 CDC established the Influenza Reagent Resource (IRR) as a warehouse for CDC-developed influenza supplies that laboratories need to carry out basic research; develop diagnostics, vaccines and drugs; and conduct surveillance for emerging influenza threats. During the pandemic, the IRR proved to be a critical resource in terms of providing domestic and international laboratories with the supplies needed to test for the new 2009 H1N1 virus.\n\nTen years later, the IRR is firmly established as a central component of influenza research, surveillance and diagnostic testing in the United States. Further, it also has been expanded to include production and distribution of additional CDC-developed reagents for a wider range of pathogens that are within the scope of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD).Some of the newer additions include reagents for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), meningitis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The program\u2019s broader scope is reflected in a new name, the International Reagent Resource.\n\nWith regard to pandemic preparedness, public health laboratories across the globe continue to use the reagents they receive from the IRR for surveillance of novel influenza viruses (such as H7N9 and H5N1) in tandem with the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS).external icon For influenza and other pathogens, CDC\u2019s subject matter experts provide technical guidance and oversight to ensure that IRR acquires, authenticates, manufactures and distributes quality-controlled reagents that support global surveillance efforts. Advances in Tests Used in Clinical Settings Compared to ten years ago, clinicians now have more tests available for detection of influenza viruses in respiratory specimens, including a wider selection of highly accurate molecular assays (some rapid, some not), and improved rapid influenza antigen detection tests (RIDTs).\n\nRapid and accurate diagnosis of influenza virus infection facilitates timely patient management for seasonal influenza as well as pandemic influenza. Influenza testing has been used to inform decisions on the use of antiviral drugs for treatment, to avoid misuse of antibiotics for treatment, and to reduce the need for other diagnostic tests. Influenza testing also can be helpful in informing recommendations for sick people living with others who are at high risk of developing serious influenza complications. See Guide for considering influenza testing when influenza viruses are circulating in the community for more information.)\n\nThe need for better rapid influenza tests and clear rapid test guidance for clinicians became apparent during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, when false-negative rapid antigen detection test results contributed to delays and missed opportunities in treating pandemic flu virus-infected patients with antiviral drugs; and delays in implementing infection control measures for such patients. [5]\n\nShortly after the pandemic, CDC and partners began working to address issues with rapid antigen detection tests available at the time, reaching an important milestone in 2017 when rapid influenza antigen detection tests (RIDTs) were reclassified by FDA (described in more detail, below) and held to higher standards.\n\nIn June 2014, a new kind of rapid influenza test was approved by FDA (the Alere (TM) i Influenza A&B test by Alere Scarborough, Inc D/B/A Binax, Inc, now owned by Abbott and called the ID NOWTIM Influenza A&B) external iconwhich detects flu A and B viruses by detecting the PB2 flu virus gene in respiratory specimens. This approval marked the beginning of a new category of tests, referred to as rapid influenza molecular assays.\n\nRapid influenza molecular assays are a relatively new type of influenza diagnostic test. These tests are similar to RT-PCR (which is also a molecular process and currently the gold standard for influenza virus detection), in that both tests use nucleic acid amplification, which detects influenza viruses in a respiratory specimen by amplifying (multiplying) certain nucleic acids (building blocks of genes) in the influenza virus genome.\n\nSince 2014, other rapid influenza molecular assays have been approved by FDA and are available for use in clinical settings. Of those, some are approved for point-of-care or bedside use, and do not require a clinical laboratory, including Cobas\u00ae Influenza A/B and Cobas\u00ae Influenza A/B RSV Assay by Roche Molecular Diagnostics; Xpert Xpress Flu and Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV by Cepheid; Accula Flu A/Flu B assay by Mesa Biotech Inc,; and ID Now TM by Abbot.\n\nRapid influenza molecular assays have a strong ability to identify correctly patients with evidence of influenza virus infection (referred to as high sensitivity, greater than 90%) and a strong ability to identify correctly patients without evidence of influenza virus infection, referred to as high specificity (90-100%). These assays produce results in 15 to 30 minutes, making them a convenient option for clinical management of patients. Other rapid influenza molecular assays (such as the Cobas\u00ae Influenza A/B & RSV Assay by Roche Molecular Diagnostics) are approved that detect influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in respiratory specimens. These tests are particularly useful in the clinical management of young children with acute respiratory illness, but can be used for persons of all ages.\n\nAdditionally, a number of other influenza molecular assays are FDA-approved, for use in a moderately complex or complex hospital clinical laboratory. These assays may take more than one hour to produce results. Many of these molecular assays detect influenza A and B viruses as well as other respiratory viruses such as adenovius, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza virus, and RSV. Some also detect some respiratory bacterial infections.\n\nBoth rapid molecular and other molecular assays are more accurate than previously available influenza tests for use in clinical settings. These advances in molecular technology provide more-accurate influenza testing results and are likely to improve clinical management of patients with suspected influenza in ambulatory care clinics and emergency departments, and in hospitalized patients as well.\n\nWith regard to rapid influenza antigen detection tests (RIDTs), to address the issues identified during the pandemic, in 2011 the CDC, the Joint Commission, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) and other public and private partners addressed key RIDT-related issues by:\n\nCreating the first method for systematically evaluating commercially available RIDTs, described in a 2012 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) article\nEnhancing awareness among clinicians of appropriate RIDT protocols with new courses, videos and decision-making tools, and;\nWorking with FDA to reclassify RIDTs from Class I to Class II with Special Controls, thereby holding current and new RIDTs to higher performance standards.\nReclassification means that RIDTs are now subject to the following requirements [6]:\n\nManufacturers must test their RIDTs annually to ensure they can detect currently circulating seasonal flu viruses. RIDTs with lower sensitivity to those flu viruses will need to indicate so on their labeling.\nRIDTs must meet minimum performance criteria, such as high sensitivity and high specificity to detect flu viruses in respiratory specimens compared to RT-PCR or viral culture. This means that currently FDA-approved RIDTs will now be more accurate in detecting flu viruses in respiratory specimens than previous RIDTs.\nIn the event of a pandemic, manufacturers must test the reactivity of their RIDTs with the newly emergent flu virus as soon as virus samples become available.\nSince 2017 when reclassification of RIDTs occurred, manufacturers have made positive, steady changes to rapid influenza antigen detection tests, but more work still needs to be done. Surveillance\nRight-sizing initiative The massive amount of laboratory testing that occurred during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic provided an opportunity for researchers to identify the optimal levels of influenza surveillance and laboratory testing needed in the United States, including ways to improve efficiency.\n\nTo answer those questions, in 2010, CDC and the Association of Public Health laboratories (APHL) began developing a \u201cright-size\u201d approach to influenza virologic surveillance which was based on extensive input from public health laboratories and stakeholders. Since then, this right-size approach has helped public health laboratories to:\n\nstandardize virologic surveillance practices, determine the optimal number of specimens to test to produce statistical confidence in resulting data, and define public health surveillance priorities;\nadopt requirements, resources and statistical calculators that aid in planning and justifying budget and resource requests;\nincrease the understanding and support from political leaders and the public;\nspeak a common language between laboratories and epidemiologists; and\nassist decision makers in analyzing the impacts of budget decisions on national surveillance objectives, especially with regard to pandemic preparedness capacity. Automated transmission of laboratory reports\nIn addition to identifying the optimum \u201csampling\u201d strategy, major improvements in sharing this data have taken place. In March 2010, five laboratories were routinely sharing data electronically with CDC. Today, all public health laboratories at the state level and some local public health and clinical laboratories send data electronically to CDC\u2019s Influenza Division This increase has improved the timeliness and completeness of reporting, for both seasonal influenza surveillance activities and the identification of novel influenza A viruses.\n\nIncorporation of NCHS mortality data\nIn collaboration with the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), since the 2015-2016 flu season CDC\u2019s Influenza Division has used mortality data collected from death certificates and reported to NCHS as the principal tool to track influenza-associated mortality in the United States.\n\nThe shift to NCHS data marked a significant advance in the capacity to track flu mortality, owing in part to efforts made by NCHS to improve the timeliness of jurisdiction reporting and modernize the infrastructure of national vital statistics, all of which resulted in a system capable of supporting near real-time surveillance of most deaths in the United States.\n\nThe new system presents deaths by the date of occurrence rather than by the date on which deaths were registered. It also provides a consistent case definition and covers nearly all deaths occurring in the United States, which is an improvement over the previous (now retired) system which accounted for only 25 percent of all US deaths. Inclusion of electronic data in ILINet CDC\u2019s U.S. Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) collects data each week from up to 3,500 outpatient health care providers across all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Each week, these health care providers report the total number of patients seen, and the number of patients seen with influenza-like illness (ILI), by five age groups. The process of reporting numbers of total patients and ILI patients was labor-intensive, sometimes leading to reporting delays and dips in participation. Since the pandemic, more ILINet providers have used electronic health records in determining ILI and patient visits, thereby reducing the reporting burden and providing more-comprehensive, efficient and timely surveillance. ILINet now captures more patient visits: during the 2018-19 season, more than one million patient visits were reported weekly, almost double the number of patient visits reported weekly during the 2009 pandemic.\n\nAntiviral resistance testing\nAnother step forward in surveillance is the number of public health laboratories in the U.S. that test for resistance to influenza antiviral medications, which increased from four laboratories before the 2009 H1N1 pandemic to 20 laboratories in 2019. This improvement was accomplished through training courses, site visits, technical and other support from CDC. In addition, four laboratories are now able to conduct advanced testing for antiviral drug resistance, using a more sensitive and complex procedure. Since 2018, CDC\u2019s influenza laboratories have been testing seasonal and animal viruses for susceptibility to the newest anti-influenza drug \u2013 baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) and a CDC-developed assay is now being implemented at the public health laboratory designated for antiviral testing (NIRC, Albany NY). Lastly, in collaboration with a World Health Organization (WHO) expert group, reference laboratory materials for detection and reporting of influenza drug resistance have been developed and shared with laboratories around the world. The Burden of Influenza\nDuring the pandemic, influenza hospitalization rates increased, particularly among groups of people at high risk of developing serious flu complications.\n\nThe Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in children and adults. It has provided critical data for:\n\ninforming policy and decision making, especially with regard to vaccine and antiviral prioritization;\nevaluating the effectiveness and safety of pandemic vaccine; and,\nidentifying groups at high risk for severe flu complications.\nOver the course of the pandemic, CDC refined and revised its hospitalization surveillance methods, eventually developing a way to use FluSurv-NET data to estimate the range of 2009 pandemic flu illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths (also referred to as \u2018estimates of flu burden\u2019) in the United States.\n\nSince the 2009 pandemic, this method of estimation has been applied at the end of each flu season as a means of illustrating the national impact of seasonal flu. In 2019, CDC also began providing on a weekly basis preliminary estimates of the burden of influenza during flu season.\n\nBurden of influenza averted through vaccination CDC also developed estimates of the number of flu illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths prevented by flu vaccination each flu season. These estimates are made with mathematical models that combine illness rates, vaccine coverage, and vaccine effectiveness, to estimate the amount of flu that would have occurred without flu vaccination. The amount of flu that was prevented by vaccination was the difference between what would have occurred and what was estimated to have actually occurred. CDC has continued to estimate the benefits of influenza vaccination each season. Now, CDC and its partners are better able to communicate the benefits of flu vaccination and provide clear evidence on the public health impact that vaccination can have in reducing flu illness. Vaccine effectiveness monitoring\nWhile FluSurv-NET provided vaccine effectiveness (VE) data during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the US Flu VE Network has yielded in-depth data about how well flu vaccines are working each flu season since its inception in 2005.\n\nSeasonal VE data are instrumental in making vaccine policy decisions and improving virus selection to update the composition of seasonal vaccines. VE data are also pivotal to understanding the epidemiology and severity of pandemic and seasonal influenza and to mounting an appropriate responses.\n\nFollowing the pandemic, multiple improvements were made to the US Flu VE Network including expanding the number of sites, increasing enrollment, improving the timeliness of data collection and reporting, and building an infrastructure for conducting special studies to improve the benefits of vaccines. In addition, in 2016-17 CDC established the Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN), which focuses on VE among severely ill adults, as opposed to VE among persons seen as outpatients. With regard to available data, at the time of the pandemic, VE studies had shown that influenza vaccination reduced the risk of mild or moderately severe influenza by approximately half among children and adults, but there were gaps in knowledge about how well the vaccine worked in preventing lab-confirmed influenza among pregnant women and in preventing life-threatening influenza among children and adults.\n\nVE data directly influence policymakers\u2019 decisions regarding influenza vaccination policy both in the United States and in other countries, so over the last 10 years CDC has created partnerships and funded research to address major VE knowledge gaps, all with an eye toward advancing vaccination efforts in the U.S. and internationally.\n\nPregnant Women The first CDC-funded study to address these gaps, which was also the first to use laboratory-confirmed influenza outcomes to assess VE among pregnant women, was published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases in January 2014. This study, which looked at Kaiser Permanente health plan members in two regions, showed that influenza vaccination reduced their risk of flu illness by half during 2010 to 2012, indicating that flu vaccine works about as well in pregnant women as in other young, healthy adults. The study showed influenza vaccine effectiveness estimates among pregnant women were similar to those found in other studies among young adults, which ranged from 44% to 51% from 2010 to 2012.\n\nSee Study Finds Flu Vaccine Reduces Risk of Flu Illness in Pregnant Women by Half for more information.\n\nThe second CDC-funded study was published in Clinical Infectious Diseases in October 2018: it was the first study to show that vaccination protects pregnant women against flu-associated hospitalization.\n\nTo conduct this study, CDC partnered with a number of other public health agencies and health care systems in Australia, Canada, Israel, and the United States through the Pregnancy Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (PREVENT), which consists of health care systems with integrated laboratory, medical, and vaccination records. Sites retrospectively examined medical records of more than two million women who were pregnant from 2010 through 2016 to identify those who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed flu.\n\nKey findings of this study include the following:\n\nOver the course of six flu seasons, getting a flu shot reduced a pregnant woman\u2019s risk of being hospitalized from flu by an average of 40 percent.\nMore than 80 percent of pregnancies overlapped with flu season, underscoring the likelihood that pregnant women will be exposed to flu at some point during their pregnancy.\nFlu vaccine was equally protective for pregnant women with underlying medical problems such as asthma and diabetes, which also increase the risk of serious medical complications including a worsening of those chronic conditions.\nFlu vaccine was equally protective for women during all three trimesters.\nSee Flu Vaccine Reduces Risk of Flu Hospitalization Among Pregnant Women for more information.\n\nChildren and Adults:\nIn March 2014 another critical gap was filled, when the first study to estimate VE in children against flu admissions to pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) was published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. CDC researchers found that getting a flu vaccine reduces a child\u2019s risk of flu-related intensive care hospitalization by 74%, illustrating the important protection flu vaccine can provide to children against more-serious flu outcomes.\n\nResearchers analyzed the medical records of 216 children age 6 months through 17 years admitted to 21 PICUs in the United States during the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 flu seasons.\n\nThough flu vaccination was associated with a significant reduction in risk of PICU admission, flu vaccine coverage was relatively low among the children in this study: only 18 percent of flu cases admitted to the ICU had been fully vaccinated.\n\nMore than half (55 percent) of PICU cases had at least one underlying chronic medical condition that placed them at higher risk of serious flu-related complications.\n\nSee New Study Shows Flu Vaccine Reduced Children\u2019s Risk of Intensive Care Unit Flu Admission by Three-Fourths for more information.\n\nIn August 2018, a CDC-supported study published in Vaccine was the first to provide statistically significant VE estimates for adults against hospitalization and admission to ICU.\n\nThe study was conducted over four flu seasons from 2012 to 2015 and found that flu vaccination prevented severe disease:\n\nFlu vaccination among adults reduced the risk of being admitted to the hospital with flu and placed in a general ward bed by 37 percent.\nFlu vaccination was even more effective in preventing the most severe forms of flu and reduced the risk of being admitted to an ICU with flu by 82 percent.\nBecause flu vaccine varies in how well it works and people who are vaccinated may still get sick, the study also looked at whether flu vaccination reduced the severity of illness among hospitalized people who were vaccinated compared to those who were unvaccinated and found that:\n\nAmong adults who were admitted to the hospital with flu, vaccinated adults were 59 percent less likely to have very severe illness resulting in ICU admission than those who had not been vaccinated.\nAmong adults in the ICU with flu, vaccinated patients on average spent 4 fewer days in the hospital than those who were not vaccinated previously.\nThe study was a collaborative project with CDC, conducted through the Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness Research and Surveillance project, which prospectively enrolled hospitalized adults 18 years and older from 2012 to 2015 in Auckland, New Zealand. Eligible hospitalized patients were those who had an overnight admission with acute respiratory illness. Once enrolled in the study, patients self-reported their flu vaccination status and were tested for flu infection by RT-PCR. Prevention\nInfluenza Vaccines\nCDC and its partners have made significant progress in influenza surveillance; diagnostics; characterizing viruses for vaccine strain selection; and developing systems to evaluate the effectiveness of influenza vaccines over the last ten years.\n\nFor example, with regard to vaccine development, by using newer production technologies CDC can now identify and provide candidate vaccine viruses for novel influenza threats to manufacturers within a matter of weeks.\n\nThis and other improvements have helped to better protect the public from seasonal and pandemic influenza threats through vaccination. However, to more fully protect Americans from seasonal and pandemic flu, more effective vaccines are needed and more people still need to receive annual flu vaccines.\n\nIn line with that public health mission, more doses of seasonal vaccines and different vaccine products are available than ever before. In addition to trivalent inactivated vaccine and live attenuated influenza vaccine, the following vaccines have been approved by the FDA and are now available:\n\na high dose vaccine that is designed specifically for people 65 and older to help create a stronger antibody response;\na trivalent flu vaccine made with adjuvant (an ingredient added to vaccine that helps create a stronger immune response), which was approved for people 65 years of age and older;\nthe first U.S.-approved cell-based flu vaccine, which can potentially be made more quickly than traditional egg-based vaccines and does not require a large supply of eggs to produce;\nquadrivalent (four component) flu vaccines that protect against both lineages of influenza B viruses thus offering expanded protection against circulating influenza viruses; and,\nrecombinant influenza vaccines, which do not require an egg-grown vaccine virus or eggs to produce, and which may be manufactured more quickly than egg-based vaccines.\nCDC is currently exploring new ways to further improve influenza vaccine through the influenza vaccine improvement initiative (iVii). The initiative includes two primary goals.\n\nGoal 1: Build the evidence base for developing more-effective influenza vaccines, and increase the impact of vaccines that are currently available.\n\nThis goal points to the need for deeper data, so during the 2018-19 season, CDC increased the number and scope of VE Network participants by over 1,500 children and adults, bringing the total number of participants enrolled to more than 10,500.\n\nCDC also is increasing the diversity of people who can be enrolled in studies and has expanded VE monitoring through innovative use of health care and other data sources outside of the US Flu VE Network. The laboratory process of evaluating vaccine response through the use of enhanced serologic and cellular testing has also been improved.\n\nGoal 2: Increase the capacity of CDC laboratories to select, develop, evaluate and perform virus characterization to provide candidate vaccine viruses.\n\nTo accomplish this, CDC is employing state-of-the-art technologies to increase the volume of laboratory testing being done. CDC also is working on developing new assays for manufacturers and regulatory laboratories, and planning evaluation projects that support vaccine improvement.\n\nCDC also is focusing on expanding and improving global virus detection, and improving vaccine effectiveness monitoring. This is being done through the expansion of Next Generation Sequencing and fully transitioning to the Sequence-First initiative described earlier. In the process, CDC has also worked with partners to automate the pipeline used to produce, store and share the enormous volume of NGS data.\n\nCDC also is piloting an advanced laboratory strategy to identify viruses, using antigenic data that are likely to predominate in the human population in future influenza seasons.\n\nCDC meets regularly with vaccine manufacturers and other WHO Collaborating Centers and Essential Regulatory Laboratories including FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research to share information on a number of vaccine-related topics.\n\nTopics include the availability of candidate vaccine viruses for use in the development and production of seasonal influenza vaccines, the availability of protocols and reagents needed for the development, standardization, and regulation of influenza vaccines, and to discuss potential issues related to the timely production of seasonal influenza vaccines. The group meets from the time the vaccine composition is announced until vaccines are released for distribution to health care providers, for both the northern and southern hemisphere influenza seasons.\n\nSeparately, frequent Flu Risk Management Meetings serve as a venue to discuss issues relating to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) response to seasonal and pandemic influenza. Subjects for discussion include but are not limited to seasonal surveillance updates, effectiveness of influenza vaccines, vaccine and antiviral stockpiles, emerging influenza virus surveillance, clinical trial response to influenza outbreaks of novel influenza viruses, and pandemic preparedness. Community Mitigation Measures\nCommunity Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza \u2013 United States, 2017\n\nBased on lessons learned from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response and an expanded contemporary NPI evidence base, CDC published updated pre-pandemic planning guidelines \u2013 Community Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza \u2013 United States, 2017 \u2013 in MMWR Recommendations and Reports on April 21, 2017. The guidelines offer free CE credits for healthcare and public health practitioners, and are available at https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/rr/pdfs/rr6601.pdfpdf icon.\n\nThe 2017 guidelines summarize key lessons learned from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response; encourage state and local public health officials to plan and prepare for implementing NPIs early in an influenza pandemic in community settings; describe new or updated pandemic planning and assessment tools; and provide the latest scientific findings to support updated recommendations on the use of NPIs to help slow the spread and decrease the impact of an influenza pandemic. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic response highlighted that pre-pandemic planning and preparedness \u2013 from local to federal levels \u2013 must be broad, flexible, and multi-sectoral, and emphasized the critical value of public engagement and community preparedness \u2013 including families, schools, and businesses \u2013 for successful NPI implementation during a pandemic. Research conducted during and in the wake of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic documented that public acceptance of NPIs in the United States is generally high, even for disruptive measures like school closures. These findings underscore the importance of pandemic preparedness at all levels of society to ensure timely implementation of community mitigation measures from the onset of a future pandemic, when these measures may be the only tool available in many jurisdictions.\n\nTo help implement the 2017 guidelines and to assist states and localities with pre-pandemic planning and decision-making in their communities, CDC also published online six plain-language, pre-pandemic NPI planning guides for various audiences and community settings: households, educational settings, workplace settings, community- and faith-based organizations serving vulnerable populations, event planners of large/mass gatherings, and health communicators in community preparedness. The six guides are available.\n\nCDC continues to conduct and support research to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of NPI implementation in various community settings. Select NPI research references, as well as additional NPI communication, education, and training materials, are available at CDC\u2019s dedicated NPI website. Treatment The number of available, approved and recommended treatment options has increased in the last ten years.\n\nDuring the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the influenza antiviral medication oseltamivir (oral oseltamivir, available under the trade name Tamiflu\u00ae) was used extensively for treatment, while zanamivir (inhaled, trade name Relenza\u00ae) was used less.\n\nOral oseltamivir\u2019s widespread use was due to it being approved, recommended and utilized for treatment of patients hospitalized with severe influenza. It also was recommended for use in hospitalized patients with non-severe influenza, although no antiviral medications were approved by FDA for use in that group.\n\nOutpatients could be prescribed either oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir, which were both approved for early treatment of uncomplicated influenza by FDA.\n\nOf the two medications, CDC was more concerned with the possibility of resistance emerging against oseltamivir, which did happen, but not often. The oseltamivir-resistant viruses that did emerge were not transmitted easily from person to person, and zanamivir was used effectively to treat them.\n\nBeginning in April 2009 and continuing for a few years after the pandemic, the FDA\u2019s Emergency Investigational New Drug (EIND) program provided an application process which authorized investigational use of IV zanamivir for patients with severe and life-threatening influenza.\n\nLater, on October 23rd, 2009, FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for IV Peramivir. At the time, IV Peramivir was an investigational intravenous antiviral drug used rarely to treat people who had been hospitalized with severe influenza. The drug was held in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) and distributed by CDC under the EUA. Licensed clinicians were able to request this product through the CDC website electronic request system, and product was delivered directly to hospital facilities until June 2010 when the EUA was terminated. Following the pandemic, in December 2014, IV Peramivir was approved by FDA for early treatment of uncomplicated influenza in outpatients, which also opened up some off-label use in treating influenza in hospitalized patients. Previously, with the exception of the IV Peramivir EUA during the pandemic, oseltamivir and zanamivir were the only recommended antiviral medications for treatment of influenza. (The other approved antiviral drugs \u2013 amantadine and rimantadine \u2013 were not and are still not recommended due to high levels of resistance detected in circulating influenza viruses).\n\nRoughly three years later, in September 2017, FDA approved the first generic version of oseltamivir.\n\nOseltamivir, zanamivir and IV peramivir are all neuraminidase-inhibitor influenza antiviral medications, so named because each works by targeting the neuraminidase surface protein of the influenza virus to stop the virus from being released from infected cells and spreading to healthy cells.\n\nIn December 2018, a new influenza antiviral medication called oral baloxavir marboxil (trade name Xofluza\u00ae) was approved by FDA and is recommended for treatment of influenza. Baloxavir works differently, primarily by preventing an influenza virus from multiplying when it is inside a cell. Because baloxavir works differently, it is in a new class of antiviral medications called cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitors. Like the neuraminidase-inhibitor medications, baloxavir has activity against both influenza A and B viruses. Baloxavir is approved for early treatment of uncomplicated influenza in outpatients aged 12 years and older.\n\nWith more antiviral medications approved, recommended and available, treatment options have improved for both hospitalized patients with severe influenza and outpatients seeking treatment early for uncomplicated influenza. There remains a gap, however, in approved antiviral treatment options for hospitalized patients with non-severe influenza, although CDC and IDSA (Infectious Diseases Society of America) continue to recommend that those patients be treated with neuraminidase-inhibitor antiviral medications. Decision-making tools\nRisk assessment (IRAT)\nThe 2009 H1N1 pandemic highlighted the public health value of developing an objective, scientifically based tool for assessing the potential pandemic risk posed to humans by influenza A viruses circulating in animals. To fill that need, CDC developed an evaluation tool now called the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) with help from global animal and human health influenza experts. IRAT launched in 2011 and since then CDC has used it to evaluate the potential risk posed by viruses that are not currently circulating in people. The IRAT relies on input from subject matter experts representing a variety of expertise in the study of influenza viruses. It uses 10 evaluation criteria grouped into major categories including properties of the virus, attributes of the human population, and epidemiology and ecology of the virus, to generate scores that indicate the potential risk of the virus to emerge as a pandemic virus, and the potential impact if it does.\n\nThe IRAT is not a prediction tool. Rather, the IRAT provides structure to prioritize and maximize investments in pandemic preparedness; identify key gaps in information; document transparently the data and scientific process used to inform management decisions associated with pandemic preparedness; provide a flexible means to easily and regularly update the risk assessment of novel flu viruses as new information becomes available; communicate effectively to the general public, policymakers, public health laboratories and other stakeholders; and provide a means to weigh the 10 evaluation criteria differently depending on whether the intent is to measure the ability of a virus to \u201cemerge\u201d as a pandemic-capable virus, or \u201cimpact\u201d the human population after emerging.\n\nSince its inception eight years ago, the IRAT has been used by CDC to evaluate and inform pandemic preparedness decisions for 16 viruses, the results of which are listed at Summary of Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) Results. Forecasting\nUnlike traditional surveillance systems that lag behind the real-time situation, flu forecasting offers the possibility to look into the future and forecast when and where flu increases will occur, how large the impact of flu will be, and when flu will peak. Forecasts can inform messaging to health care providers regarding influenza vaccination and antiviral treatment for patients, help to prepare for an influx of illnesses and hospitalizations, and be used to guide community mitigation strategies, such as school closures.\n\nTo support the development of the science of flu forecasting and its application for public health, CDC, through the Epidemic Prediction Initiative (EPI), organized the first FluSight challenge to forecast the timing, intensity, and short-term activity of the influenza season during the 2013-14 season. Each influenza season since then, Influenza Division researchers have worked with CDC\u2019s EPI and other external researchers to improve flu forecasting. CDC provides forecasting teams data, relevant public health forecasting targets, and forecast accuracy metrics evaluated against actual flu activity while each team submits their forecasts based on a variety of methods and data sources each week. During the 2018\u201319 season, forecasting teams provided over 30 national-level forecasts each week.\n\nThese challenges have provided the scientific and public health community with experience in real-time forecasting, the ability to evaluate forecast accuracy, and familiarity in communicating and applying these forecasts in real-world settings. These experiences are critical to developing a network of forecasters capable of providing results that public health officials can use, both in seasons and during an influenza pandemic.\n\nForecasts are currently used to inform CDC\u2019s activity summaries provided to public health officials and CDC leadership, and to inform messages to the general public regarding the timing of the influenza season and steps the public can take to protect their health. International work CDC has strong global ties with other WHO Collaborating Centers for Influenza, National Influenza Centers and ministries of health around the world. These collaborators provided critical data throughout the influenza pandemic on how, when and where the pandemic virus might be changing and if the monovalent pandemic vaccine would continue to be effective in preventing infection.\n\nCDC\u2019s Influenza Division formed an influenza international capacity-building initiative in 2004, which provided a five-year period of financial support for nine countries to improve laboratory diagnostics and sentinel surveillance for influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infection. In 2009, this number increased to 37 countries receiving support under 39 cooperative agreements.\n\nThus, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic occurred at a time when many of the 37 countries benefited from the newly established influenza surveillance and laboratory capacities. The pandemic provided the ultimate test to determine whether their laboratory diagnostics and surveillance systems were indeed strong enough to manage the massive surges in flu activity that would come their way.\n\nShortly after the pandemic, eight of the 37 countries transitioned to the program\u2019s second five-year period, called the sustainability period. During this period, financial support was reduced as the programs focused on sustaining the gains made in laboratory diagnostics and surveillance. The countries focused on standardizing foundational aspects of influenza surveillance including regular influenza activity reporting and sending viruses to CDC and other WHO Collaborating Centers, all with an eye toward ensuring preparedness for the next pandemic.\n\nNow, following 10 years of the pandemic\u2019s race around the globe, which caused hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide, many countries have graduated from the sustainability period to maintenance and some are now developing in-country seasonal influenza vaccination programs based on their influenza surveillance data.\n\nThe 2009 H1N1 pandemic tested U.S. laboratory and surveillance systems and highlighted many successes along the way, shining a light on one of the biggest takeaways of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic: develop seasonal influenza epidemiology and laboratory capacity that\u2019s flexible enough to handle the next pandemic.",

            "Text": "Where did the 2009 H1N1 flu virus come from?\nThe 2009 H1N1 influenza virus (referred to as \u201cswine flu\u201d early on) was first detected in people in the United States in April 2009. This virus was originally referred to as \u201cswine flu\u201d because laboratory testing showed that its gene segments were similar to influenza viruses that were most recently identified in and known to circulate among pigs. CDC believes that this virus resulted from reassortment, a process through which two or more influenza viruses can swap genetic information by infecting a single human or animal host. When reassortment does occur, the virus that emerges will have some gene segments from each of the infecting parent viruses and may have different characteristics than either of the parental viruses, just as children may exhibit unique characteristics that are like both of their parents. In this case, the reassortment appears most likely to have occurred between influenza viruses circulating in North American pig herds and among Eurasian pig herds.  Reassortment of influenza viruses can result in abrupt, major changes in influenza viruses, also known as \u201cantigenic shift.\u201d When shift happens, most people have little or no protection against the new influenza virus that results. For more information, see \u201cHow the Flu Virus can Shift: Drift for Shift.\u201d\n\nWhy does CDC think this?\nThere are three primary reasons why experts from CDC and other public health research institutions around the world think 2009 H1N1 influenza resulted from reassortment of influenza viruses that occur naturally among pigs.\n\nReason One\nThe different gene segments of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus are traceable to influenza viruses found in pigs. All influenza viruses have eight genes. Six of the eight genes found within the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus are associated with influenza viruses that regularly cause illness in pigs in North America. The remaining two genes of the 2009 H1N1 flu virus are associated with influenza viruses that previously were only known to be circulating among pigs from Eurasia.1, 2 The mixing of live pigs from Eurasia and North America through international trade or other means could have created the circumstances necessary for influenza viruses from North American and Eurasian pigs to mix. In fact, a 2009 study in Nature demonstrated that reassortant influenza viruses with genes from North American and Eurasian pigs were found in samples collected from pigs in Hong Kong as early as 2004.2*\n\n*The reassortant influenza viruses found in Hong Kong from 2004 are different from the 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses that have caused human illness around the world today, but these viruses serve as an example of how reassortment can occur naturally among influenza viruses found in Eurasian and North American pigs.\n\nReason Two\nEvidence suggests that the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus has existed and evolved in nature for some time prior to being detected in humans. There are laboratory techniques available for looking at how and at what speed influenza viruses evolve and change. This is related to a concept known as \u201cmolecular evolution.\u201d  Evolution refers to small changes in influenza viruses that happen continually over time. Generally speaking, influenza viruses generate mutations by passing from one animal to another animal for several years and through virus replication in the animal host. These mutations are represented by changes in the nucleotides and amino acids found within influenza viruses. These small changes occur at a relatively stable rate in all influenza viruses. As a result, scientists can compare the number of mutations found within a new influenza virus with older, related influenza viruses to estimate the amount of time that it may have taken for one strain to evolve into a new strain of influenza virus.  Researchers at CDC used this molecular evolution method to determine that the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus likely evolved in nature \u2013 perhaps through circulation in an unknown animal host \u2013 for a number of years before being detected. At this time, CDC continues to monitor the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus for changes. Research so far suggests that the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus is changing at a normal rate as compared to other influenza viruses.\n\nReason Three\nThe 2009 H1N1 influenza virus does not have the adaptations that are typical of influenza viruses grown or created in laboratories. For example, the standard method of growing influenza virus in laboratories involves injecting the virus into fertilized chicken eggs. The 2009 H1N1 influenza virus lacks the properties associated with growth in eggs.  \n\nHave viruses similar to the 2009 H1N1 virus been seen before?\nPrior to the discovery of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, this particular combination of gene segments from North American and Eurasian swine had never been detected before in a single influenza virus and this new virus is different from the influenza viruses that normally circulate in North American and Eurasian pigs. It is not known when reassortment occurred to create the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus.  Testing of the virus suggests that this reassortment event may have occurred years prior to the first reports of 2009 H1N1 influenza infection in people.1, 2 Scientists call 2009 H1N1 influenza a \"quadruple reassortant\" virus, because although each separate gene segment of the virus has been found in pigs previously, the individual gene segments of the virus originated from humans, birds, North American pigs and Eurasian pigs.\n\nWhy does the 2009 H1N1 flu virus have genes from humans, birds, and from pigs on different continents?\nPigs can be infected by influenza viruses found in birds and other animals as well as people.  Therefore, pigs represent a mixing vessel in which influenza viruses from different species can swap genes. For example, in a setting where people and animals are in close contact, pigs can be infected by influenza viruses found in pigs, poultry or humans \u2013 sometimes at the same time. For at least 80 years, influenza viruses known as \u201cclassical swine H1N1\u201d viruses have circulated in North American pigs. However, in the late 1990s, a series of reassortment events occurred between influenza viruses found in pigs, humans and birds. As a result, swine influenza viruses with genes from humans, North American pigs and birds have existed in many parts of the world for around 10 years prior to 2009 H1N1 flu. Mixing of these \u201ctriple reassortant North American swine influenza viruses\u201d with Eurasian swine viruses likely resulted in the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus.\n\nWas the 2009 H1N1 flu virus created in a laboratory?\nThis is very unlikely. Each of the gene segments within the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus have been found in pigs for more than 10 years prior to the beginning of the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak.2  Pigs have long been considered a possible mixing vessel for influenza viruses that originate within pigs, birds and humans. In addition, a 2009 Nature study showed that reassortment between influenza viruses found in North American and Eurasia pigs had already occurred at least once naturally in the 5 years prior to the identification of 2009 H1N1 flu. Also, the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus does not have adaptations consistent with viruses grown in laboratories. For more information, see reasons 1, 2 and 3 above.\n\nHow often does reassortment of influenza viruses occur?\nWe know that reassortment occurs frequently in nature. Fortunately, reassortment rarely results in a virus with pandemic potential, though it has done so at least twice in the 20th century. The influenza viruses that caused the 1957 and 1968 pandemics contained a mixture of gene segments from human and avian influenza viruses.  What is clear from genetic analysis of the viruses that caused these past pandemics is that reassortment (gene swapping) occurred to produce novel influenza viruses that caused the pandemics.  In both of these cases, the new viruses that emerged showed major differences from the parent viruses.  However, not all viruses emerge directly from reassortment events. For example, the origins of the 1918 virus are not precisely known, but experts think it is likely that the 1918 virus may have resulted from a bird influenza virus directly infecting humans and pigs at about the same time without reassortment.\n\nWhat can be done to identify influenza viruses circulating in animals that have pandemic potential?\nThe emergence of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus in humans highlights the need for better surveillance of influenza viruses in pigs and other animals.  The mixing of influenza genes in pigs can result in the emergence of viruses with pandemic potential in humans. Improved surveillance of influenza in pigs and other animals may help to detect the emergence of influenza viruses with the potential to cause illness and spread among people, possibly resulting in a pandemic.  Early detection of such viruses can alert public health officials and aid in pandemic preparedness through the development of appropriate diagnostic tests and influenza vaccine candidate viruses, if necessary.",

This document provides interim guidance and will be updated as needed\n\nThis document provides updated interim guidance on the use of facemasks and respirators for decreasing the exposure to 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus. This guidance replaces other CDC guidance on mask and/or respirator use that may be included in other CDC documents in regards to the outbreak of 2009 H1N1 virus. No change has been made to guidance on the use of facemasks and respirators for health care settings. This document includes guidance on facemask and respirator use for a wider range of settings than was included in previous documents and includes recommendations for those who are at increased risk of severe illness from infection with the 2009 H1N1 virus compared with those who are at lower risk of severe illness from influenza infection. For more information about human infection with 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus, visit the CDC H1N1 Flu website. Other CDC 2009 H1N1 guidance will be updated with the information contained in this document as soon as possible.\n\nDetailed background information and recommendations regarding the use of facemasks and respirators in non-occupational community settings can be found on PandemicFlu.gov in the document Interim Public Health Guidance for the Use of Facemasks and Respirators in Non-Occupational Community Settings during an Influenza PandemicExternal Web Site Icon. Information on the use of facemasks and respirators in health care settings is available. Information on the effectiveness of facemasks and respirators for decreasing the risk of influenza infection in community settings is extremely limited. Thus, it is difficult to assess their potential effectiveness in decreasing the risk of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus transmission in these settings. In the absence of clear scientific data, the interim recommendations below have been developed on the basis of public health judgment, the historical use of facemasks and respirators in other settings for preventing transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses, and on current information on the spread and severity of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus.\n\nIn areas with confirmed human cases of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus infection, the risk for infection can be reduced through a combination of actions. No single action will provide complete protection, but an approach combining the following steps can help decrease the likelihood of transmission. These recommended actions are:\n\nWash hands frequently with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub*\nCover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth\nPeople who are sick with an influenza-like illness (ILI) (fever plus at least cough or sore throat and possibly other symptoms like runny nose, body aches, headaches, chills, fatigue, vomiting and diarrhea) should stay home and keep away from others as much as possible, including avoiding travel, for at least 24 hours after fever is gone except to get medical care or for other necessities. (Fever should be gone without the use of fever-reducing medicine). \nAvoid close contact (i.e. being within about 6 feet) with persons with ILI.\nIn addition, influenza antiviral medications are an important tool for the treatment and prevention of influenza, including 2009 H1N1. Also see Guidance on the use of antiviral medications.\n\nFacemasks and Respirators\nRecommendations for the uses of facemasks and/or respirators are listed in Table 1 below for different settings where a person may be exposed to 2009 H1N1 virus. These recommendations also differ based on whether the person exposed to 2009 H1N1 is in a group at increased risk for severe illness from influenza infection. More information on preventing influenza transmission in health care settings can be found in the Interim Guidance for Infection Control for Care of Patients with Confirmed or Suspected 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Infection in a Healthcare Setting.\n\nIn community and home settings, the use of facemasks and respirators generally are not recommended.  However, for certain circumstances as described in Table 1, a facemask or respirator may be considered, specifically for persons at increased risk of severe illness from influenza.\n\nUse of N95 respirators or facemasks generally is not recommended for workers in non-healthcare occupational settings for general work activities.  For specific work activities that involve contact with people who have ILI, such as escorting a person with ILI, interviewing a person with ILI, providing assistance to an individual with ILI, the following are recommended:\n\nworkers should try to maintain a distance of 6 feet or more from the person with ILI;\nworkers should keep their interactions with ill persons as brief as possible;\nthe ill person should be asked to follow good cough etiquette and hand hygiene and to wear a facemask, if able, and one is available;\nworkers at increased risk of severe illness from influenza infection (see footnote 3 of table 1) should avoid people with ILI (possibly by temporary reassignment); and,\nwhere workers cannot avoid close contact with persons with ILI, some workers may choose to wear a facemask or N95 respirator on a voluntary basis.\nIn the occupational healthcare setting, respiratory protection is recommended.  Because infection control precautions, including respiratory protection, are imperfect, workers who are at increased risk of severe illness from influenza, and who are caring for a patient with known, probable, or suspected 2009 H1N1 or ILI, may consider temporary reassignment to avoid exposure.\n\nAdditional recommendations for use of facemasks by people who have ILI that may be due to 2009 H1N1 infection are included in Table 2.\n\nThere are important differences between facemasks and respirators. Facemasks do not seal tightly to the face and are used to block large droplets from coming into contact with the wearer\u2019s mouth or nose. Most respirators (e.g. N95) are designed to seal tightly to the wearer\u2019s face and filter out very small particles that can be breathed in by the user. For both facemasks and respirators, however, limited data is available on their effectiveness in preventing transmission of H1N1 (or seasonal influenza) in various settings. However, the use of a facemask or respirator is likely to be of most benefit if used as early as possible when exposed to an ill person and when the facemask or respirator is used consistently. (Ref. 1. MacIntyre CR, et al. EID 2009;15:233-41. 2. Cowling BJ, et al. Non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent household transmission of influenza. The 8th Asia Pacific Congress of Medical Virology, Hong Kong, 26-28 February 2009.)\n\nFacemasks:  Unless otherwise specified, the term \u201dfacemasks\u201d refers to disposable facemasks cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as medical devices. This includes facemasks labeled as surgical, dental, medical procedure, isolation, or laser masks. Such facemasks have several designs. One type is affixed to the head with two ties, conforms to the face with the aid of a flexible adjustment for the nose bridge, and may be flat/pleated or duck-billed in shape. Another type of facemask is pre-molded, adheres to the head with a single elastic band, and has a flexible adjustment for the nose bridge. A third type is flat/pleated and affixes to the head with ear loops. Facemasks cleared by the FDA for use as medical devices have been determined to have specific levels of protection from penetration of blood and body fluids. Facemasks help stop droplets from being spread by the person wearing them. They also keep splashes or sprays from reaching the mouth and nose of the person wearing the facemask. They are not designed to protect against breathing in very small particle aerosols that may contain viruses. Facemasks should be used once and then thrown away in the trash.\n\nRespirators: Unless otherwise specified, \"respirator\" refers to an N95 or higher filtering face piece respirator certified by the CDC/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). A respirator is designed to protect the person wearing the respirator against breathing in very small particle aerosols that may contain viruses. A respirator that fits snugly on the face can filter out virus-containing small particle aerosols that can be generated by an infected person, but compared with a facemask it is harder to breathe through a respirator for long periods of time. Respirators are not recommended for children or people who have facial hair.\n\nWhere respirators are used in a non-occupational setting, fit testing, medical evaluation and training are recommended for optimal effectiveness.\n\nWhen respiratory protection is required in an occupational setting, respirators must be used in the context of a comprehensive respiratory protection program as required under OSHA\u2019s Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134). This includes fit testing, medical evaluation and training of the worker. When required in the occupational setting, tight-fitting respirators cannot be used by people with facial hair that interferes with the face seal.\n\nWhen respirators are used on a voluntary basis in an occupational setting, requirements for voluntary use of respirators in work sites can be found on the OSHA websiteExternal Web Site Icon.\n\nEmployers should continue to evaluate workplace hazards related to the 2009 H1N1 situation in accordance with CDC and OSHA guidance. Mandatory use of respiratory protection may be required when work activities in occupational settings confer risk that is task/function based, and risk analyses conducted by the employer could identify hazardous work activities. For example, performing activities which generate large amounts of aerosols require respiratory protection regardless of the setting in which it is performed (i.e. in a hospital, an outpatient setting, a prison).\n\nFor additional information on facemasks and respirators, see the CDC/NIOSH website, the Food and Drug Administration websiteExternal Web Site Icon, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration websiteExternal Web Site Icon.\n\ntop of page\n\nGroups at Higher Risk for Severe Illness from 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) Infection\nGroups of people at higher risk for severe illness from 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection are thought to be the same as those people at higher risk for severe illness from seasonal influenza. These groups include:\n\nChildren younger than 5 years old\nPersons aged 65 years or older\nChildren and adolescents (younger than 18 years) who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy and who might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection\nPregnant women\nAdults and children who have asthma, chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic, hematological, neurologic, neuromuscular, or metabolic disorders such as diabetes;\nAdults and children who have immunosuppression (including immunosuppression caused by medications or by HIV)\nResidents of nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities. \nTable 1.

Respirator\nThe effectiveness of respirators and facemasks in preventing transmission of 2009 H1N1 (or seasonal influenza) in various settings is not known. Use of a facemask or respirator is likely to be of most benefit if used correctly and consistently when exposed to an ill person.  (Ref. a) MacIntyre CR, et al.  EID 2009;15:233-41. b) Cowling BJ, et al. Non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent household transmission of influenza. The 8th Asia Pacific Congress of Medical Virology, Hong Kong, 26-28 February 2009.)\n\nFor the purpose of this document, respirator refers to N95 or any other NIOSH-certified filtering face piece respirator.\n\nPersons at increased risk of severe illness from influenza (i.e. high-risk persons) include those groups at higher risk for severe illness from seasonal influenza, including:  children younger than 5 years old;  persons aged 65 years or older;  children and adolescents (younger than 18 years) who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy and who might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection;  pregnant women;  adults and children who have pulmonary, including asthma, cardiovascular, hepatic, hematological, neurologic, neuromuscular, or metabolic disorders, such as diabetes; adults and children who have immunosuppression (including immunosuppression caused by medications or by HIV); and, residents of nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities.\n\nThe optimal use of respirators requires fit testing, training and medical clearance. Proper use is recommended to maximize effectiveness. The use of facemasks may be considered as an alternative to respirators, although they are not as effective as respirators in preventing inhalation of small particles, which is one potential route of influenza transmission.  There is limited evidence available to suggest that use of a respirator without fit-testing may still provide better protection than a facemask against inhalation of small particles. Respirators are not recommended for children or persons who have facial hair (see FDA websiteExternal Web Site Icon).\n\nUse of N95 respirators or facemasks generally is not recommended for workers in non-healthcare occupational settings for general work activities.  For specific work activities that involve contact with people who have influenza-like illness (ILI) (fever plus at least either cough or sore throat and possibly other symptoms like runny nose, body aches, headaches, chills, fatigue, vomiting and diarrhea), such as escorting a person with ILI, interviewing a person with ILI, providing assistance to an individual with ILI, the following are recommended: a) workers should try to maintain a distance of 6 feet or more from the person with ILI; b) workers should keep their interactions with the ill person as brief as possible; c) the ill person should be asked to follow good cough etiquette and hand hygiene and to wear a facemask, if able, and one is available; d) workers at increased risk of severe illness from influenza infection (see footnote 3) should avoid people with ILI (possibly by temporary reassignment); and, e) where workers cannot avoid close contact with persons with ILI, some workers may choose to wear a facemask or N95 respirator on a voluntary basis  (See footnote 1). When respirators are used on a voluntary basis in an occupational work setting, requirements for voluntary use of respirators in work sites can be found on the OSHA websiteExternal Web Site Icon.\n\nSee case definitions of confirmed, probable, and suspected 2009 influenza A (H1N1). Also see infection control in the health care setting. When respiratory protection is required in an occupational setting, respirators must be used in the context of a comprehensive respiratory protection program as required under OSHA\u2019s Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134). This includes fit testing, medical evaluation and training of the worker.\n\n\u201cCaring\u201d includes all activities that bring a worker into proximity to a patient with known, probable, or suspected 2009 H1N1 or ILI, including both providing direct medical care and support activities like delivering a meal tray or cleaning a patient\u2019s room.\n\nTable 2.

At that time, there were 118,000 cases in 114 countries, with more than 90% of those infections reported in just four countries. As of Friday, there were more than 28 million cases in 214 countries. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said yesterday that the WHO program aimed at speeding global access to coronavirus tests, treatments and vaccines needs $35 billion to scale up.\nThe United States remains the most impacted country, with almost 6.4 million cases. While nearly 30 US states are reporting downward trends in Covid-19 cases, the US is still seeing about 36,000 new Covid-19 cases a day. That's fewer than in mid-August when the number was almost 80,000 a day, but \"still too high,\" according to Fauci. \"I keep looking at that curve and I get more depressed and more depressed about the fact that we never really get down to the baseline that I'd like,\" he said.\nFauci predicted the US will continue to see coronavirus surges, although he dismissed the idea that this will be a second wave of the pandemic. \"I don't talk about second surges because we're still in the first surge,\" he said. \"We're going to see these surges that we've seen in the southern states, in the Midwest and now, if you look at the map, it's Montana, North and South Dakota, Michigan, Minnesota, Iowa.\"\nYOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED\nQ: My kid hates the idea of nasal swabs. Is there a saliva test for Covid-19?\nA: The SalivaDirect test could soon be a fast and cheap option. \"We simplified the test so that it only costs a couple of dollars for reagents, and we expect that labs will only charge about $10 per sample,\" said Nathan Grubaugh, one of the Yale researchers who developed the test.\nThe SalivaDirect test can produce results in less than three hours, and the accuracy is on par with results from traditional nasal swabbing. The Yale researchers said it might become publicly available in the coming weeks.\nSend your questions here. Are you a health care worker fighting Covid-19?

The nation of 1.3 billion people added 96,551 new cases on Friday.\nWith more than 4.5 million cases, India is the world's second-worst impacted country after the US. But its reported mortality rate -- calculated by the number of deaths per 100 confirmed cases -- is surprisingly low compared to other countries with high infection rates.\nThe Indian government claims the lower death rate is a sign of its success in handling the crisis and has used the figure to support its decision to lift some coronavirus restrictions. But some experts warn that the data is full of gaps, Jessie Yeung and Manveena Suri report. Adults with Covid-19 are much more likely to have visited a restaurant\nPeople who tested positive for Covid-19 were approximately twice as likely to have reported dining at a restaurant in the 14 days before becoming ill than those who tested negative, according to a new study from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe researchers took a close look at how patients responded to questions about wearing masks and various community-based activities, including whether they recently ate at a restaurant, hung out a bar or went to a gym, for instance.\nThey found that 42% of the adults who tested positive reported having close contact with at least one person known to have Covid-19, compared with 14% of those who tested negative. Most of the close contacts, 51%, were family members.\nAstraZeneca says it could still have vaccine approval by end of 2020\nAstraZeneca should still be on track to have a set of data to submit for approval of a Covid-19 vaccine before the end of the year, despite having to pause the trial because of an illness in a volunteer, CEO Pascal Soriot said yesterday.\nThe drug company said Tuesday it had temporarily halted the trial because of the volunteer's unexplained illness. The WHO's Chief Scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan said yesterday that the pause was normal procedure and good clinical practice.\nRegulators will examine the data to determine when and if the trial can proceed.\nA 40-year party could finally be over\nIbiza is perhaps the best-known Balearic island, attracting everyone from celebrities who arrive on superyachts, to planeloads of young British and German tourists looking for a good time. But thanks to a summer characterized by quarantines, shuttered nightclubs and canceled flights, the Balearic Islands -- alongside other European party hotspots across the Mediterranean -- are suffering from an abysmal hangover without even having enjoyed the night before, Francesca Street reports.\nON OUR RADAR\nThe number of vacant Manhattan apartments climbed to a record 15,025 in August.\n\"Saturday Night Live\" is heading back to 30 Rock for the first time since March.\nThe UK sent millions of workers home for the pandemic.

So CNN Business' Kathryn Vasel asked career experts for some solutions to common work-from-home problems and concerns. Here's what she found out:\nYou're worried about your career: Now that almost everyone in your company is working from home, you might have more access to meetings and conversations that only higher-level executives used to attend. Ask to join those meetings. You can learn new information, meet new people and find new opportunities.\nMotivation is lacking: Time can seem pretty meaningless these days. Before you know it, several hours have passed and you haven't been as productive as you should have. Create a schedule that blocks off time for things like work that requires deep thought, creative thinking, meetings and emails.\nYou feel overworked: Remember when you sat at your desk for eight hours straight in the office? Yeah, me neither. Add breaks into your schedule.

            "Text": "(CNN)People who let down their guard and got too close to others over Labor Day weekend should get tested for Covid-19, White House coronavirus task coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said.\n\nMuch of the coronavirus spread by people who don't have symptoms is happening between and within families and in settings such as neighborhood parties, Birx said Thursday at a media briefing at the University of South Carolina.\nPeople who socialized closely with others, especially without a mask, should get tested, Birx said.\n\"Just because we know someone, we think that there's no way that they could have Covid, but I want to tell you, you can't tell,\" said Birx.\n\"We really encourage all of you to continue to get tested when you've had that kind of exposure, so we can stop community spread,\" she added.\n\"Our nature is to want to be with others and socialize,\" Birx told reporters. \"What we're asking people to do is to socialize smart.\"\nGiven that people can't eat and drink while wearing masks, the results of a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study may not be surprising.\nIn the study, adults who tested positive for Covid-19 were about twice as likely to have reported dining at a restaurant in the 14 days before becoming ill than those who tested negative.\n\"Reports of exposures in restaurants have been linked to air circulation. Direction, ventilation, and intensity of airflow might affect virus transmission, even if social distancing measures and mask use are implemented according to current guidance,\" researchers wrote.\n\"Masks cannot be effectively worn while eating and drinking, whereas shopping and numerous other indoor activities do not preclude mask use.\"\nUniversities and colleges in all 50 states report cases\nAs schools begin their fall semester, universities and colleges are struggling to contain coronavirus outbreaks, with cases reported at campuses in all 50 states.\nMore than 40,000 Covid-19 infections have been reported among students, faculty and staff at colleges and universities nationwide. The number represents cases that CNN has reported so far -- with the actual tally likely higher due to a lag from schools that update their data every few days. With social life trickling back to life on campuses, outbreaks have hit places students congregate, such as fraternities and sororities, where some have continued to gather despite remote learning.\nA cluster of Covid-19 cases was linked to a fraternity party at the University of New Hampshire. More than 100 people attended the August 29 event and few wore masks. Eleven people connected to the party have tested positive for the virus, university officials said.\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison is directing all undergraduate students to restrict their movements for the next two weeks in an attempt to reverse the rise in Covid-19 cases.\nIn a memo to students, faculty and staff this week, Chancellor Rebecca Blank called on students to severely limit in-person interactions and stay in their residences except for essential activities. The university directed nine campus fraternities and sororities with off-campus live-in houses to quarantine for at least 14 days.\nIllinois' Bradley University on Tuesday told all of its more than 4,500 students to quarantine in their on-campus or off-campus residences for two weeks, and to attend only online classes during that time, with allowances for meal pickups and other errands.\nThough the school had less than 50 positive cases on campus, those cases led to 500 people being put in quarantine, so the school said it decided to have everybody reset.\nSome of the highest number of cases are at Miami University, University of South Carolina, Ohio State University and East Carolina University, all of which have over 1,000 confirmed cases. The University of Missouri has 862 confirmed cases while Missouri State University has 791, a CNN tally shows.\nWhile most students will likely recover, health experts have expressed concern that young people would spread the virus to the more vulnerable in their communities. Experts stress importance of flu vaccine during coronavirus pandemic\nAs cases accumulate on campuses, experts have warned that the country as a whole could see a resurgence of coronavirus cases this fall on top of flu season. A large concern is that the US could see the \"perfect storm of accelerated Covid-19 activity, as people gather more inside, in particular -- as they become continually fatigued with the mask wearing, the social distancing, and the hand hygiene, and as they are exposed to seasonal influenza,\" Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo said Thursday.\nMarrazzo, director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, made the comment during a briefing by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\n\"If there was ever a naysayer, someone who's never been vaccinated (for flu), now's the time to rise,\" Dr. Leonard Mermel, medical director for the Department of Epidemiology and Infection Control at Rhode Island Hospital, said at the same briefing. \"Get the vaccine and reduce the risk of having these two life-threatening viruses infect you at the same time, or infect one of your loved ones,\" he said.\nFor now, rates of new daily coronavirus infections reported nationwide have been dropping after a summer surge.\nThe seven-day average of new daily reported infections in the US was about 35,300 as of Wednesday, down from a peak average of 67,317 on July 22, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\nThe country's Covid-19 death rate also has dipped. The seven-day average of new daily deaths was 734 Wednesday, after it was above 1,000 from late July to August 20, JUH data show.\nCases aren't falling in every state. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said Wednesday that his state's statistics were \"getting worse by the day,\" and urged residents to do more to combat the spread.\nWest Virginia's seven-day average of new daily cases was 165 on Wednesday, up from around 100 at the end of August and around 50 at the start of July.\n\"This situation right now is really critical,\" Justice said.\nGiroir says he's 'never been told to slow down testing'\nThe coronavirus testing lead for the White House coronavirus task force said Thursday that he has never been told to slow testing, and the country is continuing to increase its testing capacity. \"I have never been told to slow down testing, or to reduce our efforts -- and in fact, we built on testing every single month,\" Adm. Brett Giroir, a physician and the assistant secretary for health at the US Department of Health and Human Services, told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta during a Research! America forum.\nHis comments come a day after experts said the US should be performing as many as 200 million Covid-19 tests every month to have any chance of controlling the pandemic. That report, from the Rockefeller Foundation and the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy, said fewer than 30 million tests are currently reported monthly in the country.\nGiroir said that \"this month, we should have the availability of over 100 million tests, and between 55% and 60% of those -- that's 55 to 60 million -- will be rapid point of care.\"\n\"This really puts us at an inflection point that we can really protect the elderly, we could protect the vulnerable, and we can do those kinds of screening testing for schools and work that we've been talking about for months now we have the tools to do that,\" Giroir told Gupta.\nDoctor expresses fury about 'misinformation'\nA frontline doctor is among those expressing fury over revelations that President Donald Trump downplayed the deadly threat from coronavirus early in the pandemic. In a series of interviews, Trump told investigative reporter Bob Woodward that he downplayed the danger because he didn't want people to panic.\nDr. Craig Spencer, the director of Global Health in ER Medicine at NY-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, expressed his anger at the disclosure.\n\"I'm furious because you want to talk about panic and wanting to reduce panic -- I think of the panic of every single family I called on FaceTime to let them know their family member was dying or had died,\" Spencer told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday. \"And I think about that multiplied by 190,000 times around this country.\"\nIt's \"almost impossible\" for health professionals to keep up with and correct the President's misinformation, he said.",

Experts -- including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director -- have warned the months ahead will be challenging. The US continues to see about 36,000 new cases each day -- which is better than August but still too high, Fauci said.\n\"I keep looking at that curve and I get more depressed and more depressed about the fact that we never really get down to the baseline that I'd like,\" he said.\nFactors could drive Covid-19 numbers up this fall. Colleges have become hotspots. And when students return home -- which health officials have urged against -- they could transmit the virus to more communities.\nAs the weather gets colder, Americans will move indoors more, where the virus spreads more easily.\nThe coming flu season will complicate diagnoses. The strains on the healthcare system will make for one of the \"most difficult times that we experienced in American public health,\" CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield has said.\nWhere we stand now\nThe US has had more than 6.4 million reported infections. At least 192,381 people have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\nThe actual number of infections could be far greater. Many may have had Covid-19 without knowing, as the CDC projects about 40% of people who are infected don't show any symptoms. Others could have been sick but never got tested. A new study says the US greatly undercounted Covid-19 cases at the start of the pandemic -- missing 90% of them -- mostly due to a lack in testing.\nAcross the US, 28 states are reporting downward trends -- including Florida and California -- compared to the previous week, and 14 are steady.\nExperts worry a surge could come weeks after Labor Day celebrations, like cases soared after the Fourth of July.\nAn ensemble forecast from the CDC now projects that between 205,000 and 217,000 people in the US will die by October 3.\nNon-symptomatic children can transmit virus, data show\nEven children with mild or no symptoms can transmit Covid-19, according to contact tracing data from three Utah child care facilities released Friday.\nResearchers said 12 children got Covid-19 in a child care location and transmitted it to at least 12 people outside, including household members.\nThey analyzed contact tracing data from 184 people with links to three child care centers in Salt Lake County from this April to July.\nThey found at least two children who had no symptoms not only had caught the virus but passed it to other people, including one mother who was hospitalized. One 8-month-old child spread the virus to both parents.\nThe researchers say that two of the facility outbreaks began with staff members who had household contacts with the virus.\nOverall, children accounted for 13 of the 31 confirmed Covid-19 case linked to the facility, and all of the children had mild or no symptoms.\nHere's what will help\nThings will begin turning around once a vaccine is widely available, Fauci says. But the approval for one is still likely months away, despite President Trump's claims that a vaccine could be available by Election Day.\nDr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, told CBS this week the likelihood a vaccine will be widely accessible this year is \"extremely low.\" Health officials including Fauci have said the vaccine is likely to be available for use by late this year or early next year. In the meantime, the CDC has advised states to begin preparing to distribute the vaccine.\nBut until the US has a vaccine, there are still ways to help curb the spread of the virus.\nFace coverings remain the most powerful tool to fight transmission.\nIf 95% of Americans wore face masks, more than 120,000 lives could be saved by January 1, experts with the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation project.\nInfected college students shouldn't be sent home\nColleges across the country have made face masks a requirement hoping to keep Covid-19 cases down. But just weeks into the first semester, campuses from all 50 states have reported infections. The University of Texas at Austin announced this week three confirmed clusters on campus which collectively account for about 100 cases. San Diego State University confirmed almost 400 infections among students, after announcing a halt on in-person instruction.\nAnd more than 1,300 Arizona State University students have tested positive since August 1.\nColleges and universities should try to isolate infected students instead of sending them home, Fauci has said. \"You send them back to their community, you will in essence be reseeding with individuals who are capable of transmitting infection, many communities throughout the country,\" he said earlier this week.\n\"So it's much, much better to have the capability to put them in a place where they could comfortably recover.\"",

            "HeadLine": "A new front in coronavirus disinformation: Wall Street research",
            "Text": "New York (CNN)Coronavirus misinformation is infecting the unlikeliest of places: Wall Street research that investors rely on to trade in the financial markets.\n\nIn an early August note to clients, an analyst at a research firm called Fundstrat Global Advisors, which distributes widely-read reports and analysis to investors, cited a series of tweets by an ophthalmologist named James Todaro who painted a rosy picture of the US population's potential for developing herd immunity to coronavirus.\nIn a research note sent to clients on August 11th, Fundstrat co-founder Thomas J. Lee included four tweets Todaro sent the previous day. One of Todaro's tweets cited \"growing evidence that T cell immunity allows populations to reach herd immunity once 10-20% are infected with SARS CoV-2,\" the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.\nTodaro's claim is not supported by credible scientific research. In fact, Shane Crotty, an immunologist at the Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, told CNN Business that Todaro's tweets are \"dangerous\" to public health. The presence of Todaro's tweets in a Wall Street research note suggests the campaign to downplay the virus championed by the president and his supporters is gaining traction. Todaro is one of the people who appeared in a viral video in July promoting hydroxychloroquine that Facebook and YouTube later removed because they said it was promoting misinformation.\nCNN confirmed that Todaro received a medical degree in 2014 from Columbia University's Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, but he does not appear to have practiced medicine beyond the end of his residency at the Kresge Eye Institute in Detroit in 2018, according to his LinkedIn profile and tweets.\nHe last performed eye surgery in 2018 \"before stepping away from ophthalmology to focus exclusively on blockchain and cryptocurrency,\" according to Todaro's profile on the website of Blocktown Capital, a blockchain firm he started.\nCoronavirus misinformation\nWhile coronavirus misinformation is ubiquitous on social media, there's an expectation that Wall Street research is more reliable than the kind of information that winds up in most people's Facebook feeds. Analysts funnel research into a private pipeline that influences whether paying clients feel bullish or bearish about the economy, corporate profits and, more recently, the trajectory of the coronavirus.\n\"There should be a difference between Wall Street research and what's available on the internet. It's just that simple,\" said one hedge fund manager, who insists that clients who pay for information and analysis expect it to be well vetted and researched. This person isn't a Fundstrat client but was reacting to the Todaro tweets that Lee included in his note.\nIn his note, Lee cautioned that Todaro's assertion on T cells was \"not proven,\" and said that \"we are not healthcare experts, so take our commentary with a grain of salt.\" But Lee elevated Todaro's interpretation of science without mentioning Todaro's lack of expertise in immunology or epidemiology.\nLee, Fundstrat's co-founder and head of research, is a 25-year industry veteran who has appeared on CNBC, Fox Business, Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg more than a dozen times this year. He was on CNN Business as recently as last month.\nIn response to repeated and detailed requests for comment, Lee did not address any of the specific claims in his August 11th note, sent by email to clients. Instead, he referred CNN Business to an article that cited Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, saying that it is \"conceivable\" that common cold T cells \"could have some degree of protection.\"\nProviding some degree of protection has little to do with herd immunity, which comes only after many people have either been effected and recovered, or vaccinated. Doctors say trying to achieve herd immunity by allowing coronavirus to simply make its way unimpeded through the population could cost 2 million American lives.\nAn industry veteran\nBefore co-founding Fundstrat in 2014, Lee worked at J.P. Morgan for seven years, according to his Fundstrat bio. He served as the chief US equity strategist within J.P. Morgan's investment bank before leaving.\nOn its \"About Us\" web page, Fundstrat says that it focuses \"on delivering analysis, not opinions, and as an independent research provider, our clients are assured that our work is tailored to provide fresh and innovative intelligence to aid in their investment process.\"\nLee has been praised by some financial observers for correctly predicting the market's strong rebound from its March lows.\nSo when Lee included a string of Todaro's tweets in a note to clients on August 11th, it alarmed another industry insider, Michael Cembalest, chairman of Market and Investment Strategy for J.P. Morgan Asset Management. A person familiar with the bank's research relationships confirmed that Fundstrat is one of J.P. Morgan's many research providers.\nCembalest took issue with the Todaro tweets Lee cited, which suggested that \"some kind of herd immunity is reached\" when \"a community has 10-20 percent infection rate.\"\n\"It was one of the more disturbing pieces of research I've seen in 33 years in this industry,\" said Cembalest, in a note to JP Morgan clients several days later. \"Misinformation and mindless regurgitation of poorly vetted sources are, in my view, part of the reasons why\" the United States is behind other developed countries in controlling the virus, Cembalest wrote in his August 18th note.\nLee's inclusion of Todaro's tweets \"was highly misleading, as the casual reader would infer that they were from an authoritative source and not from someone with no special training in the area and who had left the medical field,\" said Georgetown University associate professor James J. Angel, who specializes in regulation of global financial markets and reviewed Lee's August 11th note at CNN's request.\nWhen misinformation winds up in Wall Street research notes, it influences the way investors think, according to Cembalest. \"It's like defense attorneys who can say something that gets stricken from the record, but it gets retained in the minds of the jurors,\" Cembalest said.\nA controversial tweet\nCembalest was also disturbed by Lee including another Todaro tweet in his August 11th note, which suggested that the \"coronavirus vaccine industry\" had an incentive to push for lockdowns and masks. Lee described the tweet as \"noteworthy, not because it is true,\" but because it \"highlights the complex incentives.\"\nLee added that \"experts dismiss steroids or HCQ [hydroxychloroquine] as treatment regimes, because it could also not be that profitable,\" without providing evidence to support that statement.\nBut in June a panel at the National Institutes of Health recommended the common steroid dexamethasone \u2014 which suppresses inflammation -- in patients with severe and critical Covid-19.\nCembalest told CNN that Lee's August note isn't the first time he believes Lee trafficked in unproven theories without offering legitimate sources. For example, Cembalest provided CNN with an April email exchange between the two men where Lee wrote, \"I think the US states/hospitals are now seeing incentives to report higher cases.\" There's no evidence to support this assertion.\nQuestionable sources\nTodaro's Michigan medical license and license to prescribe controlled substances both lapsed in June 2019, according to that state's Department of Licensing and Regulation. Todaro, when asked about his credentials and Dr. Crotty's criticism, replied that Crotty should \"look at what's happening in the real world.\"\nYet Todaro's lack of recent practice hasn't prevented him from spreading dubious theories about coronavirus on his widely-viewed social media accounts -- or becoming a darling of the right-wing media.\nTodaro co-wrote a widely criticized paper in March touting hydroxychloroquine as an effective treatment for coronavirus, which he posted as a Google Doc. After Tesla founder Elon Musk blasted the paper out to his Twitter followers, it was cited by Breitbart News and The Blaze, and one of Todaro's co-authors went on Tucker Carlson's Fox News show to tout it as a potential cure -- the same day Trump started promoting the drug in his press briefings. More recently, Todaro was a guest on Steve Bannon's podcast.\nOne of the people listed as a co-author of Todaro's paper subsequently asked to be removed from the paper, saying he had nothing to do with writing it. Later, as other studies raised doubts about hydroxychloroquine's effectiveness and safety in treating Covid-19, Todaro's paper was temporarily blocked by Google. Links on Twitter now warn that it could be \"potentially spammy or unsafe.\"\nA viral video\nIn July, Todaro appeared in a viral video of doctors promoting hydroxychloroquine speaking on the steps of the United States Supreme Court. The video -- which was retweeted by Trump, his son Donald Trump, Jr. and other conservative figures -- showed Todaro and other doctors in white gowns with the words \"America's Frontline Doctors\" stitched in blue on their chests as they promoted hydroxychloroquine. Other physicians in the video include Stella Immanuel, a Houston doctor who has claimed that alien DNA is used in some medical treatments.\nIn late July, after that video was taken down, Todaro and several of the other doctors in the video met with Vice President Mike Pence. \"Doctors everywhere should be able to prescribe hydroxychloroquine without repercussions or obstruction,\" Todaro tweeted after the meeting.\nMore recently, Todaro has shifted his focus to the idea that the immune system's response to the common cold could play a role in herd immunity.\nTodaro bases his theory on recently published articles in respected scientific journals citing research that shows about 50 percent of the US population has T cells that can recognize the novel coronavirus even though these individuals never had Covid-19. The body's immune system produces T cells in response to infections, including some coronaviruses that can cause the common cold and that are very similar to SARS CoV-2.\nBut the presence of these T cells doesn't mean that 50 percent of the population is immune to Covid-19, according to Crotty, the immunologist who co-led a study on T cells and antibodies.\n\"Todaro was saying 'don't worry, we're basically there on herd immunity and this is going to be over by October,'\" said Crotty, who called out Todaro on Twitter for misrepresenting T cell research. \"That's not what our data says, and that's not the way the immune system works and this isn't the way herd immunity works. It's just incorrect.\"\nAlthough Lee acknowledged in his note that Todaro's viewpoint was controversial, he didn't mention that Todaro's previous attempts to spread misinformation have been debunked. There's no evidence that Lee has updated his clients to reflect that one of the lead researchers in T cells had denounced Todaro's tweets.\nLee has not responded to CNN's request for confirmation that he has updated Fundstrat's clients on either of these issues.",

Over the following months, additional airports began the process of checking passengers from high-risk countries. For a brief period, the screenings resulted in long lines and overcrowded conditions at US airports.\nThe administration now appears set to end those screenings, a move first reported by Yahoo News. US Customs and Border Protection deferred comment to the Department of Homeland Security, which declined to comment. An administration official told CNN that a draft public affairs guidance memo lays out the rationale for ending airport screening: Of the 675,000 passengers screened at 15 airports, fewer than 15 had been identified as having Covid-19. Airlines for America, an aviation industry group, agreed with the decision to cease screenings, saying in a statement: \"We continue to support spending scarce screening resources where they can best be utilized and no longer believe that it makes sense to continue screening at these 15 airports given the extremely low number of passengers identified by the (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) as potentially having a health issue.\"\nIt's been difficult to measure the effectiveness of the screenings. Data provided to the House Oversight Committee earlier this year revealed few passengers were stopped in initial screenings of international flights from early coronavirus hotspots outside of China.\nThe screenings included questions about medical history, current condition and contact information for local health authorities.",

            "HeadLine": "Yes, you can have Covid-19 and the flu at the same time. Here's what that could do to your body",
            "Text": "(CNN)As doctors worry about a coronavirus-and-flu \"twin-demic\" that could overwhelm the health care system, Americans must contend with another possibility: fighting both viruses at the same time.\n\n\"You can certainly get both the flu and Covid-19 at the same time, which could be catastrophic to your immune system,\" said Dr. Adrian Burrowes, a family medicine physician in Florida.\nIn fact, getting infected with one can make you more vulnerable to getting sick with the other, epidemiologist Dr. Seema Yasmin said.\n\"Once you get infected with the flu and some other respiratory viruses, it weakens your body,\" said Yasmin, director of the Stanford Health Communication Initiative. \"Your defenses go down, and it makes you vulnerable to getting a second infection on top of that.\"\nOn their own, both Covid-19 and the flu can attack the lungs, potentially causing pneumonia, fluid in the lungs or respiratory failure, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\nEach illness can also cause sepsis, cardiac injury and inflammation of the heart, brain or muscle tissues.\nHaving both illness simultaneously \"would increase the risk of longer-term effects of any of those organ systems,\" said Dr. Michael Matthay, a professor of medicine and a critical care specialist at the University of California, San Francisco.\nBut it's too early to know exactly how much worse that double whammy could be, compared to having each virus on its own.\nThat's because Covid-19 didn't spread across the US until near the end of the last flu season, Matthay said. So there's not a lot of data yet on people who get both illnesses at the same time. But Matthay suspects the potential for pneumonia would be greater if the body is infected with both the flu and coronavirus.\n\"The two (viruses) together definitely could be more injurious to the lungs and cause more respiratory failure,\" he said.\nRespiratory failure doesn't necessarily mean your lungs stop working. It means the lungs can't get enough oxygen into the blood.\n\"Acute respiratory failure can be a life-threatening emergency,\" the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute says. \"Respiratory failure may cause damage to your lungs and other organs, so it is important to get treated quickly.\"\nHow can I tell if I have Covid-19 or the flu (or both)?\n\"Symptoms of influenza and Covid-19 are pretty similar, so it's difficult to distinguish the two,\" said Dr. Leonard Mermel, medical director for the Department of Epidemiology and Infection Control at Rhode Island Hospital.\nBoth the flu and Covid-19 can give you a fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, sore throat, body aches and a runny or stuffy nose, the CDC said. \"Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults,\" the CDC said.\nBut unlike the flu, Covid-19 can cause a loss of taste or smell.\nAnd about half of coronavirus transmissions happen between people who don't show any symptoms. (Many of those people are pre-symptomatic and are more contagious before they start showing symptoms.)\nSo the best way to know if you have the novel coronavirus or the flu (or both) is to get tested.\nThe CDC has created a test that will check for both viruses, to be used at CDC-supported public health labs. The agency said it is continuing to manufacture and distribute these tests.\nHow can I avoid this flu-Covid-19 double whammy?\nWear a mask and keep physical distancing. Health officials have stressed the importance of masks and physical distancing if Americans want to control Covid-19 -- and get the economy back on track.\nWith the imminent flu season, such precautions can \"doubly protect us from both of those viruses,\" Yasmin said.\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, which is just ending its winter months and flu season, several countries have reported astonishingly low flu numbers as people wear masks and social distance. In Australia, for example, the number of lab-confirmed flu cases plummeted from 61,000 in August 2019 to 107 cases this August.\nBut in the US, some people are getting lax about mask wearing and social distancing. And that's a big problem, said Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\nShe said there could be a \"perfect storm of accelerated Covid-19 activity, as people gather more -- inside, in particular -- as they become continually fatigued with the mask wearing, the social distancing and the hand hygiene, and as they are exposed to seasonal influenza.\"\nGet a flu vaccine. This may sound obvious. Yet about half of all Americans don't get vaccinated against the flu, including most children who die from the flu.\nEven if you get a flu shot and still catch the flu later, the symptoms are usually less severe than if you got no flu vaccine at all.\nAnd since no Covid-19 vaccine is publicly available yet, the flu shot is the only way you can help inoculate yourself against having both viruses at the same time. Pediatricians say it's important for children 6 months and older to get the flu vaccine, ideally before the end of October. \"Timely influenza vaccination is particularly important\" this flu season, the American Academy of Pediatrics wrote this week.\nGetting a flu shot can also help many more people than just yourself, said immunologist Dr. Susan Bailey, president of the American Medical Association.\n\"Since hospitals and doctors' offices are going to be very busy caring for Covid-19 patients, a flu vaccine can help decrease burdens on the health care system and make sure that those who need medical care are able to get it,\" Bailey said.\nAbout 140,000 to 810,000 Americans get hospitalized with the flu each year, according to the CDC. And the number of Covid-19 hospitalizations are expected to surge more than 150% between now and December 1, according to the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.\n\"Every year, many patients get severe influenza with respiratory failure,\" Matthay said. Among patients who get severe pneumonia from the flu, \"the vast majority of those patients have not had their flu vaccine that year.\"",

            "Text": "(CNN)Drug giant AstraZeneca said Tuesday it had paused global trials of its coronavirus vaccine because of an unexplained illness in one of the volunteers.\n\n\"As part of the ongoing randomized, controlled global trials of the Oxford coronavirus vaccine, our standard review process triggered a pause to vaccination to allow review of safety data,\" the company said in a statement sent to CNN. National Institutes of Health director Dr. Francis Collins told a Senate hearing Wednesday that it's a standard precaution in vaccine trials meant to ensure experimental vaccines don't cause serious reactions among participants.\n\"To have a clinical hold, as has been placed on AstraZeneca, as of yesterday, because of a single serious adverse event, is not at all unprecedented,\" Collins said at a hearing of the Senate Heath, Education, Labor and Pensions committee.\nThe company is testing its vaccine, called the Oxford vaccine because it was developed with Britain's University of Oxford, in the United States as well as the UK, Latin America, Asia, Europe and Africa.\n\"This is a routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials, while it is investigated, ensuring we maintain the integrity of the trials,\" the statement added.\n\"In large trials, illnesses will happen by chance but must be independently reviewed to check this carefully. We are working to expedite the review of the single event to minimize any potential impact on the trial timeline. We are committed to the safety of our participants and the highest standards of conduct in our trials.\" Earlier Tuesday, AstraZeneca joined eight other companies in signing a pledge promising they would not seek premature government approval for any coronavirus vaccine. They promised they would wait until they had adequate data showing any potential vaccine worked safely.\n\"We, the undersigned biopharmaceutical companies, want to make clear our on-going commitment to developing and testing potential vaccines for COVID-19 in accordance with high ethical standards and sound scientific principles,\" the statement read. It was signed by the CEOs of AstraZeneca, BioNTech GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer and Sanofi.\n\"We believe this pledge will help ensure public confidence in the rigorous scientific and regulatory process by which COVID-19 vaccines are evaluated and may ultimately be approved,\" they added. The AstraZeneca vaccine is one of three coronavirus vaccines in late-stage, Phase 3 trials in the US. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) usually monitors trials for adverse events and can order a pause or halt a trial, but AstraZeneca did not say who had stopped the trial.\nCommon adverse events in vaccine trials include fever, headache, soreness at the injection site and muscle pain.\nRegulators and companies alike have been working to ensure people trust in the vaccine authorization process. The US Food and Drug Administration must give either emergency use authorization or full approval to any vaccine before it can be distributed in the US.\n\"This ought to be reassuring to everybody listening,\" Collins said at the hearing.\nPresident Trump has said repeatedly he thinks at least one of the vaccines could be ready before Election Day on November 3. Most groups working on the vaccine say that is extremely unlikely but Biontech CEO and co-founder Ugur Sahin told CNN earlier Tuesday he believes the vaccine his company is developing with Pfizer could be ready for regulatory approval by mid-October. Dr. Tony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said it's technically possible that if a DSMB saw strong evidence a vaccine was working before a trial was completed, it could recommend a halt to the trial so more people could get the vaccine. But Fauci said this was unlikely to happen before December.\nHowever, discussions about early authorizations and reports about White House pressure to speed along a vaccine have worried the public, as well as former FDA officials. Former FDA commissioner Dr. Robert Califf told CNN last week he was concerned even before Covid-19 that Trump would pressure the FDA to make decisions he wanted. \"One of the things that's had me on pins and needles the last four years is literally Trump could do this with any drug or device or vaccine anytime he wants to,\" said Califf, who was commissioner from January 2016 through January 2018.\nFauci and FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn have said they would not cave into political interference.",

He told a Monday news briefing that, \"we're going to have a vaccine very soon. Maybe even before a very special date.\"\nWhile Trump did not specifically mention which date, he has previously suggested that a vaccine could be ready before Election Day. Meanwhile, health experts have said for weeks that the prospect of a shot being ready by then is highly unlikely.\nPharmaceutical companies are also pushing back against the prospect. Nine companies have signed an unusual pledge, released on Tuesday, to uphold \"high ethical standards,\" suggesting they won't seek premature government approval for Covid-19 vaccines.\nThe irony of all of this is many Americans may not even want the jab, partly due to the Trump administration's mixed and misleading messages, that could undermine confidence in the vaccine process. According to a new CBS News/YouGov poll, only 21% of voters nationwide said they would immediately seek out a vaccine if one was made available in 2020, while 65% said they believed a vaccine announced this year would, by definition, be the product of a \"rushed\" process. Only 35% would regard it positively, as a \"scientific achievement.\"\nYOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED\nQ: Can I catch Covid-19 from food or its packaging?\nA: It is highly unlikely that food is a source of coronavirus transmission, according to a team of experts on food contamination.\n\"To date, there has not been any evidence that food, food packaging or food handling is a source or important transmission route for SARS-CoV-2 resulting in Covid-19,\" the International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods said in a statement.\nThose findings mirror earlier reporting from the US Food and Drug Administration that there is no real risk of getting the virus from food or food packaging.\nSend your questions here.

In Brooklyn, authorities shut down a bar over the weekend after deputies found nearly 300 people packed inside. In Nashville, thousands flocked to the bars operating with restrictions, prompting the mayor to close down portions of a road to allow for more social distancing, Christina Maxouris reports.\nThis comes as experts offer a grim prediction on what the next few months could look like, with the pandemic stacking up against flu season and new fronts opening up, including schools and college campuses. \"We're heading into the fall and the winter, when we would expect a respiratory pathogen like a coronavirus to start spreading more aggressively than it would in the summertime,\" Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner said on CBS' Face the Nation. French Open tennis tournament to be played with fans\nThe French Tennis Federation announced Monday that the 2020 French Open will be open to fans when play begins later this month -- despite a rise in cases in the country. The Grand Slam event was originally scheduled for May but was postponed by the pandemic.\nBut world No. 1 Ashleigh Barty said she won't be in Paris to defend her French Open title. The Australian said in a statement that she would not be traveling to Europe in part because of the Covid-19 pandemic as well as factoring in her lack of preparedness to play at Roland Garros.\nSerena Williams has also expressed some reservations. After beating Maria Sakkari at the US Open, Williams said: \"I'm super conservative because I do have some serious health issues, so I try to stay away from public places, because I have been in a really bad position in the hospital a few times. So I don't want to end up in that position again, so I don't know. I'll just do my best to continue to keep -- for me, I try to keep a 12-foot distance instead of 6.\"\nSpain tops half a million infections\nSpain has passed the 500,000 mark after recording a further 2,440 Covid-19 cases on Monday, making it the first western European country to pass that threshold. It now has a total of 525,549 infections, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\nThis comes as the UK reported nearly 3,000 cases for two days in a row, marking the country's highest daily totals since May. Health minister Matt Hancock said he was concerned about the rise, which he said was primarily among \"affluent\" young people. Meanwhile, Denmark is restricting public gatherings in its capital and 17 other municipalities after seeing a \"worrying\" increase in cases, its health ministry said.\nMore soccer stars catch the virus, and others breach the rules\nFrench soccer star Kylian Mbappe tested positive for Covid-19 while on international duty, the French Football Federation announced on Monday. The 21-year-old is the seventh Paris Saint-Germain player to contract coronavirus in recent weeks. Manchester City footballers Riyad Mahrez and Aymeric Laporte have also tested positive, their club announced on the same day.\nMeanwhile, two England players -- Manchester City's Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood of Manchester United -- have been sent home for breaching coronavirus rules while in Iceland.\nThe England team was in Reykjavik following a 1-0 victory over Iceland in the Nations League. Since the win, Icelandic media outlet DV reported that the players were visited by two Icelandic women in their hotel.\nPfizer and BioNTech vaccine could be ready for approval by October, says BioNTech chief\nThe collaboration between Pfizer and BioNTech is confident it can have a vaccine ready for regulatory approval by the middle of October, BioNTech CEO and co-founder Ugur Sahin told CNN.\n\"It has an excellent profile and I consider this vaccine as a vaccine which is near perfect and which has a near perfect profile,\" Sahin said in an exclusive interview with CNN's Frederik Pleitgen. He added \"this provides us with a lot of confidence in combination with understanding of the mode of action. In combination with the safety data coming in from the running trial. Yes, we believe that we have a safe product and we believe that we will be able to show efficacy.\"\nSahin told CNN he believes the approval for emergency use will be granted quickly by regulatory authorities. US drug giant Pfizer and German firm BioNTech say they plan to provide 100 million doses of their vaccine candidate, BNT162, by the end of the year, and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.\nWhile Sahin said approval could happen by mid-October, federal officials have told CNN they believe this is an optimistic timeline.

Recent surveys by UNICEF and WHO have found the pandemic is disrupting child and maternal healthcare services worldwide, including prenatal and post-natal care, vaccinations and check-ups due to fewer resources and a fear of contracting Covid-19.\n\"The global community has come too far towards eliminating preventable child deaths to allow the COVID-19 pandemic to stop us in our tracks,\" UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said in a news release.\n\"When children are denied access to health services because the system is overrun, and when women are afraid to give birth at the hospital for fear of infection, they, too, may become casualties of COVID-19,\" Fore said.\n\"Without urgent investments to re-start disrupted health systems and services, millions of children under five, especially newborns, could die,\" she added.\nOut of 77 countries surveyed by UNICEF over the summer, 68% reported disruptions in childhood checkups and vaccinations. A WHO survey of 105 countries also found 52% reported interruptions in medical services for sick kids and 51% reported disruptions in malnutrition programs. These kinds of services are critical for preventing newborn and child deaths, WHO said, citing a statistic that pregnant women who see midwives are 16% less likely to lose their babies and 24% less likely to experience pre-term birth.\n\"The COVID-19 pandemic has put years of global progress to end preventable child deaths in serious jeopardy,\" Muhammad Ali Pate, the Global Director for Health, Nutrition and Population at the World Bank, said in a statement. \"It is essential to protect life-saving services which have been key to reducing child mortality.\nNewborns were at the highest risk of death, even before the coronavirus pandemic, with a baby dying every 13 seconds in 2019, the UNICEF mortality report said. They could be at a much higher risk of death with coronavirus-related disruptions in essential health services, according to WHO.\nJohns Hopkins University, which has been tracking the pandemic from the start, said modeling showed that disruptions in healthcare due to Covid-19 could cause the deaths of almost 6,000 additional children every day. Even though progress in childhood deaths is being made, the UNICEF mortality report also predicts that if current trends continue, 10 million 5-to-14-year-olds and 52 million children under 5 will still die between 2019 and 2030. \"Almost half of these under-five deaths will be newborns whose deaths could be prevented by providing high quality antenatal (prenatal) care, skilled care at birth, postnatal care for mothers and their babies, and care of small and sick newborns,\" the report said.\n\"Reducing inequalities is essential for ending these preventable childhood deaths and for ensuring that no child is left behind,\" the UNICEF report concluded.",

            "HeadLine": "Considerations for Use of SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Testing in Nursing Homes",
            "Text": "This document provides a summary of considerations for use of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) antigen testing in nursing homes and is intended for nursing home providers and state and local public health departments.\n\nAntigen tests are available as point-of-care (POC) diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2.  They have a rapid turnaround time, which is critical to the identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection and rapid implementation of infection prevention and control strategies. These tests can augment other testing efforts, especially in settings where RT-PCR testing capacity is limited or testing results are delayed (e.g., >48 hours). In general, these POC antigen tests have a lower sensitivity, but similar specificity, for detecting SARS-CoV-2 compared to reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests.\n\nThis document pertains to antigen tests that have been granted a US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Emergency Use Authorization (FDA EUA) to detect SARS-CoV-2. The first two SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests to receive FDA EUA are authorized for testing symptomatic persons within 5 days of symptom onset and there are limited data on antigen test performance in asymptomatic persons. However, given the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic and presymptomatic nursing home residents and healthcare personnel (HCP) with SARS-CoV-2 infection, CDC is providing considerations for the use of antigen tests in asymptomatic persons during this public health emergency. Facilities should be aware of the FDA EUAexternal icon for antigen testsexternal icon and potential implications for the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)external icon certificate of waiver when using antigen tests in asymptomatic individuals and in persons >5 days from symptom onset. When a confirmatory molecular test should be considered\nAs the sensitivity of antigen tests is generally lower than RT-PCR, FDA EUAexternal icon recommends that negative POC antigen tests be considered presumptive. Clinical staff in nursing homes should consider when confirmatory RT-PCR testing might be needed prior to making clinical decisions, cohorting residents, or excluding HCP from work. When interpreting the results of antigen tests, test characteristics and probability of infection should be considered.\n\nTest sensitivity might vary between antigen testing platforms. Facilities should be aware of which platform is being used and the sensitivity of the test for the patient population to be tested. For example, the first two antigen tests that have received FDA EUAsexternal icon range in sensitivity from 84% to 97% when used within 5 days of symptom onset.\nFactors that increase the probability of infection include the presence of symptoms in the person being tested, recent exposure to someone diagnosed with COVID-19, and whether testing is being conducted in a nursing home with an outbreak or within a high-prevalence community. These factors inform the decision of whether confirmatory testing by RT-PCR is indicated following an antigen test.\nIf a confirmatory RT-PCR test is performed within 48 hours, individuals should be assumed infectious until the confirmatory test results are completed. For instance, if a symptomatic resident tests presumptive negative on antigen test and a RT-PCR is performed, the resident should remain in Transmission-Based Precautions until the RT-PCR test results. If an asymptomatic HCP working in a nursing home without an outbreak and in a county with low community prevalence tests antigen positive, they should be excluded from work until a negative RT-PCR test is available.\n\nReporting requirements for SARS-CoV-2 tests\nEvery COVID-19 testing site is required to report to the appropriate state or local public health department every diagnostic and screening test performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 or to diagnose a possible case of COVID-19. POC testing may be performed with a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)external icon certificate of waiver, but reporting of test results to state or local public health departments are mandated by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.\n\nUses of antigen testing in nursing homes\nThis document guides the interpretation of results when antigen tests are used in the following circumstances:\n\nTesting of symptomatic residents and HCP,\nTesting of asymptomatic residents and HCP in facilities as part of an COVID-19 outbreak response, and\nTesting of asymptomatic HCP in facilities without a COVID-19 outbreak as required by CMS recommendations.\nTesting in other circumstances are likely to occur, such as testing asymptomatic residents and HCP who were exposed to persons with COVID-19 outside of the nursing home (e.g., recent hospitalization or outpatient services) or through other screening activities. The principles described here can be used to guide the interpretation of antigen test results in those situations.\n\nAntigen tests should not be utilized to determine the duration of Transmission-Based Precautions nor when HCP can return to work. Test-based strategies are not generally recommended to determine duration of transmission-based precautions, nor to determine when HCP may return to work. If used, test-based strategies should rely only on RT-PCR.\n\nConsiderations for interpreting antigen test results in nursing homes\n Testing of symptomatic residents or HCP\n\nIf an antigen test is positive, no confirmatory test is necessary.\nResidents should be placed in Transmission-Based Precautions or HCP should be excluded from work.\nIf the resident or HCP is the first positive test for SARS-CoV-2 within the facility (i.e., an index case), an outbreak response should be initiated immediately.*\nIf an antigen test is presumptive negative, perform RT-PCR immediately (e.g., within 48 hours).\nSymptomatic residents and HCP should be kept in transmission-based precautions or excluded from work until RT-PCR results return.\nSome antigen platforms have higher sensitivity when testing individuals within 5 days of symptom onset. Clinical discretion should be utilized to determine if individuals who test negative on such platforms should be retested with RT-PCR.\nNote: if an individual has recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection in the past 3 months and develops new symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, alternative diagnoses should be considered prior to retesting for SARS-CoV-2.\nTesting of asymptomatic residents or HCP in nursing homes as part of an outbreak response*\n\nIf an antigen test is positive, no confirmatory test is necessary.\nResidents should be placed in transmission-based precautions, and HCP should be excluded from work.\nIf an antigen test is presumptive negative, residents should be placed in appropriate precautions for facilities with an outbreak. HCP should be allowed to continue to work with continued symptom monitoring.  The facility should continue serial viral testing (antigen or RT-PCR) every 3-7 days until no new cases are identified for a 14-day period.\nNote: asymptomatic individuals who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection in the past 3 months and live or work in a nursing home performing facility-wide testing should not be tested for SARS-CoV-2.\nTesting of asymptomatic HCP in nursing homes without an outbreak per CMS recommendations\n\nCMS recommendsexternal icon initial testing of all HCP as part of the nursing home reopening process and serial testing of HCP at an interval based on local incidence of COVID-19.\n\nIf an antigen test is positive, perform confirmatory RT-PCR test within 48 hours of the antigen test, especially in counties with low prevalence. If confirmatory test is performed, HCP should be excluded from work until confirmatory test results are completed.\nIf the confirmatory test is positive, then exclude the HCP from work and initiate an outbreak response including facility-wide testing of all residents and HCP.\nIf the confirmatory test is negative, discuss results with the local public health department to determine how to interpret the discordant results and next steps. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the local community can help interpret the likelihood of a false positive antigen test. The time between antigen test and RT-PCR test should also be considered. If RT-PCR is performed >48 hours after an antigen test, it is possible that the viral dynamics have changed during the time between antigen and RT-PCR and testing.  Therefore, the antigen test may indicate a true infection even if the RT-PCR is negative.\nIf an antigen test is presumptive negative, allow HCP to continue to work. The HCP should continue to monitor for symptoms, and serial testing should continue per CMS recommendationsexternal icon.\nNote: HCP who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection in the past 3 months and are asymptomatic should not be tested for SARS-CoV-2.\nNotes:\n\n*A COVID-19 outbreak response in a nursing home is triggered when a resident or HCP tests positive for SARS-CoV-2. An index infection in a resident should include SARS-CoV-2 infections that originated in the nursing home and should not include:\n\nResidents who were known to have COVID-19 on admission to the facility and were placed into Transmission-Based Precautions.\nResidents who were placed into Transmission-Based Precautions on admission and developed SARS-CoV-2 infection within the 14-day period after admission.",

            "Text": "The scientists who designed the Research and Development Survey (RANDS) could never have foreseen the current global pandemic. But when COVID-19 struck, they recognized the tool was uniquely ready to meet the needs of the response.\n\nRANDS was developed at CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which is home to our nation\u2019s most comprehensive and longest-running health surveys. But unlike many of NCHS\u2019 other surveys, RANDS wasn\u2019t intended to collect data itself. Rather, it was designed primarily to conduct research about survey methods.\n\nThe team has now begun using RANDS to produce data about access to healthcare, use of telemedicine, and loss of work due to illness from COVID-19.\n\n\u201cFor the first time,\u201d says Jennifer Parker, who leads NCHS\u2019 research and methodology group. \u201cRANDS will be producing data that can be used to better understand a public health problem.\u201d\n\nBetter answers lead to better outcomes\nRANDS can be used to collect information about how people answering survey questions understand them, which lets researchers find ways to improve the quality of statistics they collect.\n\n\u201cThe first step to getting reliable survey data is to make sure you\u2019re asking good questions,\u201d Jennifer says. RANDS can tell researchers \u201cif the questions they\u2019re asking mean the same thing from person to person and from survey to survey.\u201d\n\nBecause the team had spent the past five years on this project, they were able to rapidly shift that knowledge toward the COVID-19 response. RANDS offered an advantage because it could easily be adapted to cover topics that are relevant to the pandemic, Behavioral Scientist Paul Scanlon says.\n\n\u201cWhen our usual surveys were suddenly interrupted by the pandemic, we realized that in RANDS we had created a platform that could quickly fill gaps in the data,\u201d Paul says.\n\nAsking questions about questions\n\u201cA useful feature of RANDS during the pandemic is that it can help us test the validity of new questions,\u201d he adds. \u201cResponding to COVID-19 requires that we ask questions we\u2019ve never asked before. When we introduce new concepts, like quarantine, we need to understand how people think about that. RANDS is a tool, alongside cognitive interviewing, for examining how people understand and respond to questions so we can improve on them.\u201d\n\nAs a behavioral scientist, Paul usually conducts one-on-one interviews to find out how people interpret specific survey questions. \u201cWhen I interview people, there are no right or wrong answers. It\u2019s just, \u2018What do you think a question means?\u2019 \u201cFor example, if a survey question says, \u2018How is your health?\u2019 we want to understand what factors people used to come up with an answer,\u201d he says. \u201cWere they thinking about their diet and exercise habits? Or whether they\u2019re sick or in pain right now? We don\u2019t know unless we ask follow-up questions that dig deeper.\u201d\n\nWithin RANDS are a series of unique questions, known as \u201cweb probes,\u201d designed to get at this kind of information. The probes are closed-ended, multiple choice questions that ask what respondents were thinking about as they answered the other survey questions.\n\n\u201cIf we can use RANDS to understand which questions work best, we can include them later in the year when we go back to conducting our longer-term surveys,\u201d Paul says.\n\nGetting it fast, getting it right\nAnother benefit RANDS brings to the response is the way it is delivered online. In addition to testing individual questions, RANDS has also been testing the uses of web panels recruited by research companies for gathering statistics.\n\n\u201cWeb panels are not something we typically use,\u201d says Katherine Irimata, the team\u2019s mathematical statistician who evaluates new ways to collect data. \u201cFrom a statistical perspective, online surveys present some very specific challenges we need to understand before we can incorporate them into our work.\u201d\n\nFor example, the panels used for RANDS are recruited by outside vendors, and it\u2019s important that they are selected using a reliable statistical framework. Also, response rates are lower for web surveys than NCHS\u2019 usual surveys, and the format itself may have an impact on who responds or how people interpret the questions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a good position to evaluate how these issues affect the results,\u201d says Katherine. \u201cNCHS already has decades of data from the National Health Interview Survey, and we\u2019ve been able to use that to help evaluate the data from RANDS. In turn, we\u2019ve been able to use the RANDS data to inform the questions on our existing surveys.\u201d\n\nShe notes, \u201cBecause we already had the web panels in place, and because RANDS has helped us understand so much more about how these data can be used, we were able to deploy quickly in the pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe innovative science behind RANDS will open doors for better data in the future. Web surveys can reach a lot of people quickly and have the potential to be a flexible, cost-effective addition to NCHS\u2019 arsenal, especially in an emergency response.\n\n\u201cWhen we built RANDS, we knew we could leverage the strength of our national survey data to evaluate, and possibly improve, health estimates from recruited panels,\u201d Jennifer says. \u201cOur idea is that this method can help not only NCHS, but eventually all federal statistical agencies.\u201d\n\nPaul adds, \u201cWe\u2019re just beginning to explore what RANDS can do.\u201d",

            "Text": "Existing heat illness prevention programs and policies can be tailored to the unique challenges of working during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHeat stress is the total amount of heat the body encounters. It may come from a variety of indoor or outdoor sources such as:\n\nHeat from work processes and machinery (e.g., forge)\nEnvironmental temperatures, humidity, and lack of air movement (e.g., no wind or inadequate air circulation)\nInternal metabolic processes (e.g., illnesses that create fever)\nHeat generated by muscles from physical exertion\nRisk Factors for Heat-related Illnesses\n\nMany risk factors can increase a worker\u2019s risk for a heat-related illness. Risk factors may be related to the work environment or characteristics of the individual worker or their current health status.\n\nExamples of heat-related illness risk factors include:\n\nHigh temperature and humidity\nDirect sun exposure\nIndoor radiant heat sources (e.g., machinery)\nLimited air movement\nNot drinking enough fluids to maintain hydration\nPhysical exertion\nPPE and clothing (i.e., these may trap heat close to the body)\nPhysical condition (e.g., obesity) and health problems\nCertain medications\nPregnancy\nLack of acclimatization (i.e., not being used to the heat)\nAdvanced age\nHaving had a previous heat-related illness\nHeat-related Illnesses\n\nHeat stroke, the most severe form of heat-related illness is a life-threatening medical emergency. As part of your heat illness prevention program, ensure that all staff is trained to recognize early signs of heat-related illness and understand the need to get prompt medical treatment to prevent heat stroke deaths.\n\nEarly signs of heat stroke may include:\n\nConfusion\nDifficulty performing routine tasks or answering simple questions (e.g., \u201cWhat is today\u2019s date?\u201d \u201cWhere are we?\u201d)\nSlurred speech\nLate signs of heat stroke may include:\n\nSeizures\nLoss of consciousness\nOrgan failure resulting in death When are employees at additional risk for heat-related illness during the COVID-19 Pandemic?\nImplementing the COVID-19 safety and health recommendations, such as those identified in the Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers, may alter an employee\u2019s working environment. These alterations can affect the risk level for heat-related illness due to:\n\nLoss of the body\u2019s natural adaptation to heat (acclimatization). This can occur if your workplace has closed temporarily or employees have been off work for more than one week.\nLack of a re-acclimatization component of work re-entry plan. This is important to have in place if employees have been out of the work environment for a week or more.\nIncreased heat burden associated with personal protective equipment (PPE) (for healthcare personnel) or cloth face coverings or masks. These can:\nReduce the body\u2019s normal ways of getting rid of heat by sweating and other means.\nIncrease effort required to breathe (through face covering or mask, or respirator (for healthcare personnel).\nElevate perception of anxiety brought on during wear.\nIncreased physical activity if employees have to do more than their usual job tasks due to social distancing requirements.\nIncreased time in a hot environment if employees are assigned longer shifts to catch up on work slowed down by shutdowns or other pandemic-related setbacks.\nHow can employers modify their heat illness prevention programs to protect workers from exposures to both heat stress and the virus causing COVID-19?\nPre-screen employees\nReassess employees\u2019 medical conditions to determine if they are still safe to work in an environment with additional heat stress risk from\nCOVID-19 related engineering controls,\nPPE (for healthcare personnel),\nCloth face covering or mask use, and\nSocial distancing practices.\nRe-acclimatization\nPlace employees returning after an absence of one or more weeks on a re-entry work schedule that will slowly reintroduce them to working in a hot environment. Employees can often re-acclimatize in 2 to 3 days upon return to work. NOTE: Workers new to the job may take up to 14 days to fully acclimatize.\nBuddy system\nAssign buddies and remind them to assess each other for symptoms of heat-related illness. Verbal check-ins are important because social distancing and wearing cloth face coverings or masks, or respirators (for healthcare personnel) make it harder to see signs and symptoms.\nIf the work process allows for it, maintain social distancing during any check-ins.\nCloth face coverings or masks and PPE (e.g., for healthcare personnel)\nProvide workers with cloth face coverings or masks and any required PPE that provide proper protection but minimize heat stress. Some considerations include:\nCloth face coverings or masks that are lightweight and light in color.\nProtective garments (if worn) made of breathable materials that are also lightweight and light in color.\nDamp or dirty cloth face coverings or masks need to be replaced with clean ones.\nIf use of cloth face coverings or masks may increase the risk of heat-related illness, consult with an occupational safety and health professional to determine the appropriate cloth face covering or mask for the setting. Outdoor workers may prioritize use of cloth face coverings or masks when in close contact with other people (e.g., during group travel or shift meetings) and remove them when social distancing is possible. CDC provides information on adaptations and alternatives that should be considered when cloth face coverings or masks may not be feasible.\nConsider allowing workers to remove cloth face coverings or masks outdoors if work positions or seating arrangements provide more than 6 feet between employees.\nIf storing the cloth face covering or mask while at work, employees should place the used cloth face covering or mask into a dry, breathable container or paper bag labeled with the employee\u2019s name.\nWork/rest schedules\nConsider altering the current work/rest schedule to account for the additional heat stress.\nDecrease the amount of work and increase the length and frequency of rest breaks. Frequent and longer rest breaks may be needed so that workers have adequate time to remove cloth face coverings or masks, practice proper hand washing, and rehydrate while maintaining social distancing requirements.\nSchedules will also need to be adjusted with increasing temperatures and humidity.\nEnsure managers who oversee work/rest schedules and manage cooling stations are trained to recognize heat-related illnesses and actively monitor employees for these conditions.\nIf possible, modify schedules so that the majority of work hours or the most physically demanding tasks occur overnight or during cooler parts of the day.\nDaily work completion targets\nReassess daily production targets if social distancing requirements or increased rest schedules add time to an employee\u2019s tasks. Consider decreasing the number of tasks to be completed on each shift.\nMake sure the facility is well ventilatedexternal icon.\nWork with facilities management to adjust the ventilation to deliver the maximum amount of fresh air to occupied spaces while maintaining the humidity at 40-60%. If possible, increase the filter efficiency of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) units to highest functional level.\nIncrease circulation of outdoor air as much as possible in non-climate-controlled indoor workspaces by opening windows and doors and using fans when environmental conditions and building requirements allow. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk for occupants. This will increase evaporative cooling effects for workers and will help dilute any respiratory droplets produced by workers.\nIf fans such as pedestal fans or hard mounted fans are used at the worksite, take steps to minimize air from fans blowing from one worker directly at another.\nCooling stations\nEnsure that cooling stations provide shading from the sun. Position cooling or misting fans and arrange seating so that air does not blow respiratory droplets from one employee to another seated nearby.\nArrange seating in the cooling station to maintain social distancing during rest breaks. Proper social distancing is very important during breaks as workers will need to remove respirators or cloth face coverings or masks to rehydrate.\nIf providing pre-packaged water bottles or rehydration fluids (such as sports drinks), place individual bottles at each seat before employees enter the cooling station at the start of each rest cycle to avoid congregating around water refill stations.\nAt each worksite, ensure that water is always easily accessible so employees can rehydrate frequently and as needed.\nIf water refill stations are unavoidable:\nUse markers and signs to promote social distancing in the refill line.\nConsider issuing refillable drinking bottles to employees or allowing them to bring their own to be stored inside the cooling station if they cannot or do not plan to carry them while working. Refillable bottles should be clearly marked with the employee\u2019s name and designated work/rest cycle.\nIf using disposable paper cones or cups, store them in an enclosed container near the refill station to reduce the risk of contamination if someone coughs or sneezes.\nAvoid contact between the water dispenser and a drinking cup or bottle when refilling it.\nIf cooling stations are located indoors, consider using no-touch activation methods for water dispensing.\nEmergency first aid plan for heat related illnesses\nImmediately remove worker from hot environment to cooling station.\nRemove PPE (normally worn for job tasks), cloth face covering or mask, and excess clothing from affected employee to facilitate cooling.\nProvide cool liquids to drink, if the employee is alert.\nIf heat stroke is suspected:\nCall 911.\nRemove all PPE from affected employee to facilitate emergent cooling and resuscitation measures.\nWhile waiting for the ambulance to arrive, cool the employee aggressively with any means available such as immersion in cool water or an ice bath or use of misting fans. Note that use of any immersion cooling methods in someone with heat stroke with a depressed mental status should include careful positioning and constant monitoring to prevent submersion and aspiration of cooling fluids.\nOther employees providing first aid or resuscitation should continue wearing their PPE (e.g., healthcare personnel) or cloth face coverings or masks.",

Stagger times to use the break room and enter and exit the building.\nLimit the time that you are close to others, to the extent possible (e.g., shorten appointment times, limit gatherings inside the salon, discourage clients from bringing additional people to appointments).\nWear a cloth mask in public and at work, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. Cloth masks may prevent people who don\u2019t know they have the virus from spreading it to others. Cloth masks are intended to protect other people\u2014not the wearer. The spread of COVID-19 can be reduced when cloth masks are used along with other preventive measures, including social distancing. A universal face covering policy can be effective in preventing the transmission of the virus in close-contact interactions, including within a salon.\n\nBe careful when putting on and taking off cloth masks:\nDon\u2019t touch the cloth mask while wearing it.\nDon\u2019t touch your face, mouth, nose, or eyes while taking off the cloth mask.\nWash your hands before putting on and after taking off the cloth mask.\nWash the cloth mask after each use.\nConsider carrying a spare cloth mask. If the cloth mask becomes wet, visibly soiled, or contaminated at work, it should be removed and stored to be laundered later.\nCloth masks should not be worn if their use creates a new risk (for example, interferes with driving or vision, or contributes to heat-related illness) that exceeds their COVID-19 related benefits of slowing the spread of the virus. Cloth masks should also not be worn by children under the age of 2, anyone who has trouble breathing or is unable to remove the mask without assistance. CDC provides information on adaptations and alternatives that should be considered when cloth masks may not be feasible (e.g., people who are deaf or hard of hearing, have intellectual or developmental disabilities, or sensory sensitivities).\nIf you are concerned about the use of cloth masks at your workplace, discuss your concerns with your employer.\nEncourage clients over the age of 2 to wear cloth masks.\nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.\n\nContinue to follow applicable state regulations for health and public safety in addition to these recommendations.\nClean and disinfect the following items between each client:\nStyling chairs, hair washing sinks, massage tables, credit card devices, keypads, and other items that clients routinely touch.\nConsider using reusable chair covers. They should be laundered or cleaned and disinfected after each client.\nAll non-porous multi-use tools, such as shears, clippers, nippers, brushes, combs, etc.\nClean and disinfect the following areas or items on a routine basis or at least daily:\nCountertops, doorknobs, toilets (including handles), tables, light switches, phones, faucets, bathroom sinks, keyboards, etc.\nUse single use tools and supplies (e.g., salon capes) where possible.\nLaunder reusable fabric supplies after each use.\nFollow the directions on the cleaning and disinfecting products\u2019 labels, paying particular attention to proper dilution and contact times.\nWash your hands with soap and water afterwards.\nWash your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You don\u2019t need to wear gloves if you wash your hands regularly (unless they are already required for your job).\n\nUse an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol if soap and water aren\u2019t available.\nWash your hands at these key times:\nBefore, during, and after preparing food\nBefore eating food\nAfter using the toilet\nAfter blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing\nAfter putting on, touching, or removing cloth masks\nBefore and after work and work breaks\nBefore and after each client\nAfter cleaning and disinfecting\nDo not touch your face, mouth, nose, or eyes.\n\nCover your coughs and sneezes.\n\nUse tissues to cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze.\nThrow used tissues in the trash.\nWash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\n\nHow to Cope with Stress\nMental health is an important part of worker safety and health. The COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges in the ways many people work and connect with others, which may raise feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression.\n\nInformation and resources about mental health, knowing signs of stress, taking steps to manage stress, and knowing where to go if you need help are available here.\n\nHow Your Employer Can Protect You\nYour employer or the salon owner should develop a COVID-19 response plan and share it with you.

            "Text": "Jakarta, Indonesia - Medical experts have linked a surge in coronavirus cases on Bali to the inaccurate, low-cost rapid antibody test kits that are being used to screen domestic visitors to the Indonesian resort island.\n\nForeign tourists were banned from entering Indonesia on April 2, and while a plan to reopen Bali to international travellers this week has been dropped, domestic air travel resumed on July 31.\n\nSince then, the island has been welcoming an average of 3,000 domestic tourists every day, mostly from the neighbouring island of Java, the country's most densely populated province, and also the worst-hit by the pandemic.\n\nThroughout July and the first half of August, the number of new confirmed cases in Bali fell as low as 27 cases per day on August 10, with a seven-day average of 40 new cases per day.\n\nBut two weeks after the resumption of domestic travel, confirmed cases on the island began spiking, with five record-breaking days peaking at 198 new cases on September 4. As of Tuesday, Bali had 6,385 confirmed cases and 116 deaths. Across the country, the total number of cases was 196,989, with 8,130 deaths.\n\nMisinterpreting results\nIn order to enter Bali, visitors are required to present a negative rapid antibody test result that is no more than 14 days old.\n\nThey must also show no outward symptoms of the virus, such as a dry cough or fever, but Dr Dicky Budiman, an epidemiologist who has helped formulate Indonesia's pandemic response for 20 years, says the screening protocol probably allowed more cases to enter Bali.\n\n\"Rapid antibody test kits do not detect current infections. They only detect if a person has been infected within a few weeks or months ago,\" he said.\n\nHe also pointed out that the tests are \"not specific\" to COVID-19. \"If you test positive, you could have caught a different coronavirus from your dog. For this reason, Australia, England and India all stopped using them, because they are not accurate.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization in Indonesia has said the use of antibody tests gives travellers with non-reactive results a \"false sense of security\" as the tests' sensitivity to COVID-19 varies between 34 percent and 80 percent.\n\nThe Association of Indonesia's Clinical Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Specialists puts the accuracy of these tests at lower than 50 percent.\n\nBudiman says the best way to prevent domestic tourists with COVID-19 from spreading the virus in Bali is to change the screening protocol to a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test - the 'gold standard' used to screen Indonesian citizens and permanent residents returning from overseas. It's a view shared by Udayana University Professor Gusti Ngurah Mahardika, Bali's most senior virologist.\n\n\"I have said since February that rapid antibody tests are not suitable to screen people coming to Bali. It is a cheap solution suitable for screening patients in the hospital, and if the patient is reactive they need to have a PCR test to confirm if they're infected,\" he said. A reaction to the test means the person has antibodies to a virus, but if someone does not react to the test it does not mean they do not have the virus.\n\n\"They are interpreting the results the wrong way around,\" Mahardika added. \"Those with nonreactive results should have to have PCR tests on the spot or be quarantined.\"\n\nBad policy\nAhmad Utomo, a Jakarta-based independent molecular biological consultant specialising in the diagnosis of lung infections, agreed that the results of rapid antibody tests were being misinterpreted in Indonesia.\n\n\"If a person is reactive, they are building their antibodies and I would feel safer around them than those whose test results are inactive,\" he said.\n\nUtomo also said that testing for COVID-19 with rapid antibody tests is bad policy.\n\n\"They are generally not used for screening. They are an epidemiological tool used to study the burden of disease in specific areas. I don't know why they insist on them.\"But he is also sceptical about whether the surge in confirmed cases in Bali is related to the tests. He thinks the jump is more a reflection of people failing to follow guidelines designed to curb the virus's spread. Indonesia: Chinese vaccine to be tested as COVID-19 cases rise\n\"Just like East Java where cases are surging, it's probably about the behaviour of the masses,\" he said.\n\n\"People are holding public demonstrations, refusing any kind of tests, refusing to wear masks and not practising physical distancing because they don't believe the disease is real. And it's not entirely their fault.\n\n\"About 80 percent of cases in Indonesia are asymptomatic. Of the remaining 20 percent, only about half are in intensive care and the public do not see them. It's not like people are dropping dead on the street.\"\n\nPutting the economy first\nThe authorities in Indonesia have not explained why - given the concerns about reliability - the rapid antibody tests continue to be used as a travel requirement. The Bali Provincial Government, Bali Disaster Mitigation Agency and health department referred enquiries to the Bali COVID-19 Task Force, which in turn referred enquiries back to the health department.\n\nThe National COVID-19 Task Force and National Disaster Management Agency in Jakarta did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera's queries.\n\nOn Monday, Bali announced that as part of its effort to contain the pandemic, it would start imposing fines of 100,000 rupiah ($6.77) on residents seen out without a face mask. Budiman, the epidemiology expert, believes the government made the decision because \"they already bought millions of rapid antibody tests from China and want to use the stock\".\n\nBut others say the use of the tests is linked to the need to get the economy moving.\n\nWriting in the academic website, The Conversation, University of Melbourne Indonesia experts Tim Mann and Tim Lindsey said the government was concerned that the struggling economy \"could lead to more criticism of its handling of the crisis - and possibly social unrest\". The economic impact has been especially felt in Bali, where estimates show at least half, and perhaps as much as 80 percent of gross domestic product is linked to tourism.\n\nOn September 1, President Joko Widodo acknowledged the Indonesian province with \"the biggest economic contraction is Bali,\" with negative growth of 11 percent.\n\nAllowing domestic tourists to return to Bali is supposed to provide a much-needed economic lifeline for the island.\n\nThe antibody test costs about $10 per person.\n\nBut the PCR tests cost between $83 and $179, making them prohibitively expensive for many of the middle-class Indonesians who make up most of the country's domestic tourism market.\n\n\"If everyone had to take PCR tests, the cost for a family could be $1,000,\" a hotel executive in Bali told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity.",

            "HeadLine": "Race for coronavirus vaccine looms over presidential campaigns",
            "Text": "The prospect of a vaccine to shield Americans from coronavirus infection emerged as a point of contention in the White House race as President Donald Trump accused Democrats of \"disparaging\" for political gain a vaccine he repeatedly has said could be available before the election. \n\n\"It's so dangerous for our country, what they say, but the vaccine will be very safe and very effective,\" the president pledged Monday at a White House news conference. \n\nTrump levelled the accusation a day after Senator Kamala Harris, the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate, said she \"would not trust his word\" on getting the vaccine. \"I would trust the word of public health experts and scientists, but not Donald Trump,\" Harris said. \n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden amplified Harris's comments Monday after he was asked if he would get a vaccine for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Biden said he would take a vaccine, but wants to see what the scientists have to say, too. Biden said Trump has said \"so many things that aren't true, I'm worried if we do have a really good vaccine, people are going to be reluctant to take it. So he's undermining public confidence.\"\n\nStill, the former vice president said, \"If I could get a vaccine tomorrow I'd do it, if it would cost me the election I'd do it. We need a vaccine and we need it now.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth over a coronavirus vaccine played out as three of the candidates fanned out across the country on Labor Day, the traditional start of the two-month sprint to the election. Harris and Vice President Mike Pence campaigned in Wisconsin and Biden went to Pennsylvania. Trump added the news conference to a schedule that originally was blank.\n\n'They'll say anything'\nHarris, a California Democrat, said in a CNN interview broadcast Sunday that she would not trust a coronavirus vaccine if one were ready at the end of the year because \"there's very little that we can trust that ... comes out of Donald Trump's mouth.\" She argued that scientists would be \"muzzled\" because Trump is focused on getting re-elected.\n\nTrump dismissed her comments as \"reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric\" designed to detract from the effort to quickly ready a vaccine for a disease that has killed about 190,000 Americans and infected more than six million others, according to a count by Johns Hopkins University.\n\n\"She's talking about disparaging a vaccine so that people don't think the achievement was a great achievement,\" Trump said, answering reporters' questions as he stood at a lectern placed at the front door of the White House on the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the mansion. \"They'll say anything,\" he said. Trump insisted he has not said a vaccine could be ready before November, although he has said so repeatedly and as recently as Friday.\n\nThe president then proceeded to say what he had just denied ever saying.\n\n\"What I said is by the end of the year, but I think it could even be sooner than that,\" he said about a vaccine. \"It could be during the month of October, actually could be before November.\"\n\nUnder a programme Trump calls \"Operation Warp Speed\", the goal is to have 300 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine in stock by January. He has spent hundreds of billions of dollars on what amounts to a huge gamble since vaccine development usually takes years.\n\nVaccine politics Concerns exist about political influence over the development of a vaccine, and whether one produced through this process will be safe and effective.\n\nDr Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious-disease expert and a member of the White House coronavirus task force, told CNN last week that it is unlikely but \"not impossible\" that a vaccine could win approval in October, instead of November or December.\n\nFauci added that he's \"pretty sure\" a vaccine would not be approved for Americans unless it was both safe and effective. \n\nStephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, has said the agency would not cut corners as it evaluates vaccines, but would aim to expedite its work. He told the Financial Times last week that it might be \"appropriate\" to approve a vaccine before clinical trials were complete if the benefits outweighed the risks. COVID-19 vaccine: Safety concerns as countries rush for cure (2:24)\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, meanwhile, has given assurances that Trump \"will not in any way sacrifice safety\" when it comes to a vaccine. And executives of five top pharmaceutical companies pledged that no COVID-19 vaccines or treatments will be approved, even for emergency use, without proof they are safe and effective. Some concerns were sparked by a letter dated August 27 in which Dr Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, asked governors to help government contractor McKesson Corp make sure vaccine distribution facilities are up and running by November 1. \n\nRedfield did not say a vaccine would be ready by then. \n\nThree COVID-19 vaccines are undergoing final-stage, or phase three, clinical trials in the US. Each study is enrolling about 30,000 people who will get two shots, three weeks apart, and then will be monitored for coronavirus infections and side effects for anywhere from a week to two years.",

            "HeadLine": "Can drugmakers deliver a COVID-19 vaccine before the US election?",
            "Text": "As questions mount over whether the United States will authorise a coronavirus vaccine ahead of the November elections, experts say there is a slim chance that enough evidence will be available to prove one is safe and effective in that timeframe.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has repeatedly said a vaccine is possible before the November 3 election, and accused a \"deep state\" within the nation's top health regulator of trying to slow pivotal clinical trials to hamper his chances at a second term.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration denied that claim, saying its decisions will be guided by data alone. Drugmakers, seeking to bolster public confidence amid political squabbles on Tuesday pledged to uphold scientific safety and efficacy standards in their quest for a vaccine.\n\nVaccine safety was in focus on Wednesday after AstraZeneca PLC said it had put a pause on its coronavirus trial of the vaccine with Oxford to review the safety data of an unexplained illness in the United Kingdom trial. It described the move as routine and said it would restart trials when an independent committee recommended it do so.\n\nOther companies have recently made comments suggesting they could have an answer on whether their vaccines work before November. \"It would really be an amazing vaccine to show that,\" Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the Reuters news agency.\n\n\nFauci said initial trial results are likely to become available in November or December, but late October remains a possibility. \"It is conceivable that if there are enough infections documented early on that you might get that answer earlier,\" he said.\n\nVaccines must demonstrate they are at least 50 percent more effective than a placebo to be considered for approval. To prove that, government officials have said, at least 150 COVID-19 infections must be recorded among trial participants with at least twice as many occurring among the placebo group.\n\nIf a vaccine is especially effective, companies could have their answer sooner. Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc, whose US vaccine trials have enrolled thousands of people and are the most advanced, say they may have proof after just a few dozen subjects become infected.\n\nIndependent panels of experts called data and safety monitoring boards (DSMB) will review trial data at pre-specified points. These boards can recommend companies stop the trials if the evidence is overwhelmingly positive or negative.\n\nFor Pfizer, the first interim look occurs when 32 trial volunteers get infected.\n\nExperts interviewed by Reuters cautioned that information gleaned from a limited number of subjects could miss important safety issues that letting the trial fully play out might reveal.\n\n'Absolutely insufficient' Pfizer's trial calls for four interim analyses by the DSMB, the first after just 32 recorded infections. \"We may have enough data to be able to share the first analysis by October,\" said Pfizer spokeswoman Jerica Pitts. Moderna's first interim analysis will come after 53 trial subjects become infected, the company told investors last month.\n\nBasing a decision on 53 cases, is \"an absolutely insufficient number,\" said Dr Gregory Poland, a vaccine researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester who has served on FDA vaccine advisory panels. \"You would know very little about safety.\"\n\nTo halt the trials due to positive results, vaccines would likely have to exceed the 50 percent efficacy threshold.\n\nPfizer has not disclosed what standard will be used for stopping its trial early. William Gruber, head of vaccine clinical research and development for Pfizer, said: \"The standard would be evidence of very high efficacy.\"  A senior official with the US effort to accelerate COVID-19 vaccine development said companies have created appropriate trials to hold interim analyses that could detect especially effective vaccines earlier.\n\nSpeedy enrollment Although both drugmakers began vaccinating people in their respective 30,000-subject trials on July 28, Pfizer is in position to generate results earlier in part because it is administering the second shot of its two-dose vaccine a week earlier than Moderna. Moderna also slowed enrollment to ensure greater participation of at-risk minorities in its study.\n\nPfizer's trial also begins collecting data on infections that occur a week after it administers its second shot. Moderna has a two-week lag between the second shot and when it will begin collecting infection data in earnest.\n\nBoth trials are on pace to be fully enrolled soon.\n\nDr Henry Miller, a senior fellow at the Pacific Research Institute think-tank and former director of the FDA's office of biotechnology, said an emergency use authorization based on a small number of infections would not deliver an adequate answer on the safety of a vaccine intended for use by millions of healthy people. Some side effects could take four to six months to occur, he said.\n\nDr Gregory Glenn, research chief for Novavax Inc, which is also developing a coronavirus vaccine, said the October timeline remains possible. But he believes Americans will likely be waiting longer.\n\n\"I just think humility is a good thing right now,\" he said. \"The FDA set out some pretty strict criteria for success. So that's going to take a pretty good vaccine to do that.\"",

            "Text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness (see list of symptoms) caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2.\n\nHere is what we currently know:\n\nThe main way the virus spreads is from person to person through respiratory droplets when people cough, sneeze, or talk.\nYou may also be able to get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.\nThe virus may be spread by people who are not experiencing symptoms.\nCOVID-19 can sometimes cause serious complications. People at increased risk for severe illness include:\n\nOlder adults\nPeople of any age who have underlying medical conditions\nAs an offshore oil and gas employer, your workforce might come into contact with the virus when:\n\nIn close contact (within less than 6 feet) at the worksite with other people, which can include rig workers, engineers, technicians, managers, maintenance, galley staff, and housekeeping staff.\nTouching or handling frequently touched surfaces and equipment, and then touching their mouth, nose, or eyes. How You Can Protect Your Staff and Others and Slow the Spread\nEvaluate your workplace to identify scenarios where workers cannot maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet from each other and visitors. Use appropriate combinations of controls following the hierarchy of controls to address these situations to limit the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. A committee of workers and management may be most effective at recognizing all scenarios.\n\nWhile protecting workers, it is important to note that control recommendations or interventions to reduce risk of COVID-19 must be compatible with any safety programs and personal protective equipment (PPE) normally required for the job task. Approaches to consider may include the following: \n\nCreate and implement a COVID-19 Workplace Health and Safety Plan\n\nReview the CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers and the Resuming Business Toolkit for guidelines and recommendations that all employers can use to protect their employees.\n\nIdentify an on-site workplace coordinator who will be responsible for COVID-19 assessment and control.\nWhen developing plans, include all employees in the workplace, for example: staff, utility employees, relief employees, janitorial staff, maintenance, supervisory staff, rig workers, engineers, technicians, managers, maintenance, galley staff, and housekeeping staff.\nIdentify areas that may lead to close contact among employees, including work areas, break rooms, mess and galley areas, locker rooms, living quarters, and transportation vessels, such as helicopters.\nIf contractors enter the workspace, develop plans to communicate with them regarding modification to work or service processes.\nNotify all workers that any COVID-19 concerns should be directed to the identified coordinator.\nConsider standing up a virtual incident command system capable of providing telemedicine consultation, assisting with the management of suspected COVID-19 cases, and coordinating the evacuation of suspected cases to an appropriate onshore medical facility for testing or treatment.\nMaintain a daily log of approved visitors. This log should include the date and time the visitor entered and exited the offshore facility as well as their contact information. Regular crew are not considered visitors.\nDetermine if some tasks can be done remotely to reduce the number of employees on the offshore facility.\nConsider reducing personnel on board (POB) to essential personnel only while ensuring workers get enough rest and recovery.\nImplement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices.\nDevelop policies that encourage sick employees to stay at home without fear of reprisals, and ensure employees are aware of these policies.\nIf contractors are employed in the workplace, develop plans to communicate with the contracting company regarding modifications to work processes.\nConsider conducting daily in-person or virtual health checks (e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening) of employees on scheduled workdays and visitors before arrival.\nScreening options could include having employees self-screen before arriving at work or having on-site screening by taking employees\u2019 temperatures and assessing other potential symptoms prior to beginning work. (see CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers)\nMake sure employees can maintain at least 6 feet of distance while waiting for screening if done on-site.\nMake employee health screenings as private as possible and maintain the confidentiality of each individual\u2019s medical status and history.\nTake action if an employee or visitor is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19\n\nImmediately separate employees or visitors who report with or develop symptoms at work from other employees and arrange for private transport home. These employees should self-isolate and contact their health care provider immediately.\nEstablish an isolation area on the facility that is separate from other personnel and managed by designated health and safety personnel for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases.\nField managers should coordinate medevac arrangements with clients and other offshore stakeholders to ensure helicopters and boats are available and equipped to safely transport ill personnel, if necessary.\nFacility medical personnel or an onshore advisor should notify appropriate authorities before non-emergency medevac begins.\nPerform enhanced cleaning and disinfection after anyone suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 has been in the workplace. Cleaning staff should clean and disinfect offices, bathrooms, common areas, and shared equipment used by the sick person, focusing especially on frequently touched surfaces or objects. If other workers do not have access to these areas or items, wait 24 hours (or as long as possible) before cleaning and disinfecting.\nEmployees who test positive for COVID-19 should immediately notify their employer of their results.\nSick employees should follow CDC recommended steps to self-isolate or seek care. Employees should not return to work until they meet the criteria to discontinue home isolation, in consultation with healthcare providers. \nDevelop hazard controls using the hierarchy of controls to prevent infection among workers. You may be able to include a combination of controls noted below. \n\nEngineering Controls (Isolate people from the hazards)\nAlter the workspace using engineering controls to prevent exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19.\nModify the alignment of workstations where feasible. For example, redesign workstations so workers are not facing each other.\nWhere possible, establish physical barriers between workers. This includes all areas of the facilities, including work areas, break rooms, the galley, locker rooms, and living quarters.\nInstall cleanable transparent shields or other barriers to physically separate employees where distancing is not an option.\nUse strip curtains, plastic barriers, or similar materials to create impermeable dividers or partitions.\nClose or limit access to common areas where employees are likely to gather and interact, such as break rooms and in entrance/exit areas.\nEncourage social distancing of at least 6 feet between employees in all areas of the facilities.\nConsider making foot traffic single direction in narrow or confined areas, such as aisles and stairwells, to encourage single-file movement at a 6-foot distance.\nUse visual cues such as floor decals, colored tape, and signs to remind workers to maintain distance of at least 6 feet from others, including at their workstation and in break areas.\nPlace handwashing stations or hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol in multiple locations throughout the workplace for workers and visitors.\nUse touch-free stations where possible.\nMake sure restrooms are well stocked with soap and paper towels.\nMake sure the workspace is well ventilatedexternal icon.\nWork with facilities management to adjust the ventilation so that the maximum amount of fresh air is delivered to occupied spaces while maintaining the humidity at 40-60%. If possible, increase filter efficiency of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) units to highest functional level.\nPortable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration units may be considered to remove contaminants in the air of poorly ventilated areas.\nAdditional considerations for improving the building ventilation system can be found in the CDC Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers and COVID-19 Employer Information for Office Buildings.\nAdministrative Controls (Change the way people work)\nProvide training and other administrative policies to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\nAll workers should have a basic understanding of COVID-19, how the disease is spread, what the symptoms of the disease are, and what measures can be taken to prevent or minimize the transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19.\nTrainings should include the importance of social distancing (maintaining a distance of 6 feet or more when possible), wearing cloth face coverings or masks appropriately, covering coughs and sneezes, washing hands, cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces, not sharing personal items or tools/equipment unless absolutely necessary, and not touching their face, mouth, nose, or eyes.\nWorkers should be encouraged to go home or stay home if they feel sick. Ensure that sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance, and that employees are aware of and understand these policies.\nConduct health checks (e.g., screening for temperature and/or other symptoms) for all personnel and visitors before they check-in to board any marine vessels or helicopters (shorebases and heliports) to go offshore.\nConsider maintaining small groups of workers in teams (cohorting) to reduce the number of coworkers each person is exposed to.\nLimit mixing of cohort groups, if possible.\nConsider extending the duration of work shifts, for example from 21 to 28 days, on offshore facilities to reduce turnover and give workers sufficient time to self-quarantine when they are not working.\nClean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.\nIf surfaces are dirty, clean them using a detergent or soap and water before you disinfect them.\nUse products that are EPA-registeredexternal icon, diluted household bleach solutions, or alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, appropriate for surface disinfection.\nProvide cleaning materials and conduct targeted and more frequent cleaning of frequently touched surfaces (workstations, tools, equipment, galley tables and chairs, railings, countertops, doorknobs, toilets, tables, light switches, phones, faucets, sinks, keyboards, etc.).\nProvide employees adequate time and access to soap, clean water, and single use paper towels for handwashing.\nRemind employees to wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, they should use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.\nProvide hand sanitizer, tissues and no touch waste baskets at the cash registers and in the restrooms.\nLimit the number of people gathered at one time. (Consult state and local guidance if available.)\nStagger shifts, start times, break times, and mealtimes as feasible.\nConsider limiting employees\u2019 movements between floors to only essential work functions and limit staff entering employees\u2019 living quarters unless it is necessary.\nEliminate shared living quarters to the extent possible. If this is not possible, then workers should practice CDC recommended precautions for preventing the spread of COVID-19, and the employer should conduct targeted daily cleaning of these shared spaces.\nConsult CDC Guidance on Shared and Congregate Housing for special considerations for preventing COVID-19 in shared housing situations.\nRemind employees that people may be able to spread COVID-19 even if they do not show symptoms. Consider all close interactions (within 6 feet) with employees and others as a potential source of exposure.\nPost signs and reminders at entrances and in strategic places providing instruction on social distancing, hand hygiene, use of cloth face coverings or masks, and cough and sneeze etiquette. Signs should be accessible for people with disabilities (e.g., large print), easy to understand, and may include signs for non-English speakers, as needed.\nCommunication and training should be easy to understand, in preferred language(s) spoken or read by the employees and include accurate and timely information.\nEmphasize use of images (infographics) that account for language differences.\nTraining should be reinforced with signs (preferably infographics), placed in strategic locations. CDC has free, simple posters available to download and print, some of which are translated into different languages.\nUse cloth face coverings or masks as appropriate.\nCloth face coverings or masks are intended to protect other people around you\u2014not the wearer. They are not considered to be personal protective equipment.\nEmphasize that care must be taken when putting on and taking off cloth face coverings or masks to ensure that the worker or the cloth face covering or mask does not become contaminated.\nCloth face coverings or masks should be routinely laundered.\nDo not wear cloth face coverings or masks if their use creates a new risk (e.g., interferes with driving or vision, or contributes to heat-related illness) that exceeds their COVID-19 related benefits of slowing the spread of the virus. Cloth face coverings or masks should also not be worn by anyone who has trouble breathing or is unable to remove it without assistance. CDC provides information on adaptations and alternatives that should be considered when cloth face coverings or masks may not be feasible (e.g., people who are deaf or hard of hearing, have intellectual or developmental disabilities, or sensory sensitivities).\nConsider requiring visitors to the workplace (e.g., service personnel) to also wear cloth face coverings or masks.\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE)\nPPE is the last step in the hierarchy of controls because it is more difficult to use effectively than other measures. To be protective and not introduce an additional hazard, the use of PPE requires characterization of the environment, knowledge of the hazard, training, and consistent correct use. This is why special emphasis is given to administrative and engineering controls when addressing occupational hazards, including when applying guidance to slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.\nIn the current COVID-19 pandemic, use of PPE such as surgical masks or N95 respirators is being prioritized for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance, unless they were required for your job before the pandemic. Offshore oil and gas workers should continue to wear all PPE required for their normal jobs.\nHow You Can Help Your Staff and Others Cope with Stress\nMental health is an important component of worker safety and health. The COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges in the ways many people work and interact with others, which may lead to increased feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression.\n\nInformation and resources about mental health, recognizing signs of stress, taking steps to build resilience and manage stress, and knowing where to go if you, your staff, or others need help are available here.",
